## Dataset
 
Use whisper to generate transcripts with all steps outlined in -
`scripts/make_index.ipynb`
 
 ## App

Use Langchain `VectorDBQAChain` to - 
* Embed the user query
* Perform similarity search on Pinecone embeddings
* Synthesize the answer from relevant chunks with `GPT 3.5` (also benchmark GPT4)

Relevant chunks with metadata (links) are displayed as source documents.
 
This builds on the excellent UI from https://github.com/mckaywrigley/wait-but-why-gpt.
