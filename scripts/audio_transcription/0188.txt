https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 So hard. It's one of the toughest emotional things I've ever gone through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 Oh shhh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=7.6s	7.6	 I love you honey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=10.8s	10.8	 Love you too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 Yeah, it was really hard to let him go, really hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=14.4s	14.4	 But, you know, I can't keep every amazing dog I work with. I wish I could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Like, that's the hardest thing about fostering a dog. You fall in love with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 And, you know, it's so hard to let them go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 It is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 But, you know, we gotta look at the greater good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 I wanna do a whole bunch of series like this. I want to keep doing them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=36.4s	36.4	 And...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 Let's get out of their driveway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 We have an announcement. We have something really exciting to tell you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 Yes, I'm sure you have no idea what it's about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=54.8s	54.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 We have made our decision as to who we're going to adopt George out to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 So we have decided to go with Alex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 It wasn't an easy decision at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=65.6s	65.6	 We were really lucky to have a lot of qualified people who would most definitely be an amazing home to George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 I feel like Alex is in the perfect spot in life because she's got her degree, she's done with school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 She doesn't have that time constraint of school anymore, which was my biggest concern with a younger applicant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 And she has a great support system in place where her family's really involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 You were 19 when you got Indy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 Yeah, I was. It was the best decision of my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=92.8s	92.8	 Although a lot of people thought I was too young and I can completely see why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=96.4s	96.4	 So I'm just hoping that George is at the beginning of as special of a relationship as Indy and I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=101.2s	101.2	 And I think he might be. Have a good feeling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 And we're gonna drive him out to Illinois.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 Are you ready for your new life?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 I'm trying to stay all excited. I am just heartbroken inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=112.2s	112.2	 I'm going to miss him so much, but I keep finding some peace in the fact that I know he's going to an amazing family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 He's going to be surrounded by so many people that are going to be obsessed with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=123.2s	123.2	 And for that, I'm so excited and gratified for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 We are taking George to his new life in Illinois.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 Also, this would be a really great chance to see how he does on road trips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 So we've had him in the car for like 20 minutes at a time as we trained around town to kind of test him and see how he's done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=140.8s	140.8	 But traveling 13 hours, plus we're going to stay in a hotel tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 Here we are in Illinois.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 Zach's got his shorts and his winter coat on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=150.6s	150.6	 And your peppermint patties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=152.6s	152.6	 Chow and down on a peppermint patty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 His favorite road snack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=156.8s	156.8	 Hey, buddy, you're in your home state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 I don't think it's quite registered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 We keep worrying that George is not in the back of the car because he's like that quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 Oh, my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 He just did the biggest stretch while peeing like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 Oh, my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 That's so funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 Good boy, George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 Feels good to be out of the car, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 The amount that this dog loves a soft bed is so precious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 He really loves it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=183.6s	183.6	 We just had the first noise of the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 Yeah, you start barking all the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 He sees something or hears something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 Is there something around the car?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 Oh, there's another dog, a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 There's a puppy over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 Good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=193.6s	193.6	 Thank you for being quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=194.8s	194.8	 That's quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 He's learned quiet that we asked him to be quiet and he was pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 I was trying to catch the barking because he's been so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 It's like the one noise he made on the whole drive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=204.2s	204.2	 But at least there's a reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=206.8s	206.8	 Your turn to drive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=208.8s	208.8	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 Doing a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=210.4s	210.4	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=211.2s	211.2	 We're about to reach our stop for the night and George, he's back there in the crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 keeping him safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=219.8s	219.8	 He's been so quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 I mean, really quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 Yeah, he barked that one time at the gas station at a dog, like for a reason that was immediately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=228.8s	228.8	 identifiable and then he got quiet right away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=232.2s	232.2	 It was like, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=233.4s	233.4	 Yeah, he's not anxious at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=234.8s	234.8	 So we'll see how he does at the hotel tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=238.6s	238.6	 Our last night with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 We're paying a hefty pet fee at this place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=242.8s	242.8	 So kind of feel like we should get our money's worth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 He's going to sleep in the bed with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=247.6s	247.6	 Oh, I don't know, Bree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 Ready to go to a hotel?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 Whoa, big stretch.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 Once we checked in, we loved on him knowing this was going to be our last night with him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 and we did our best to explain how amazing his new life was going to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=268.4s	268.4	 Well, I got Zach this orange for breakfast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 Seems like George found it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=274.8s	274.8	 George, I had that up on the table.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 Been under here for like two minutes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=542.7s	542.7	 shifted gears there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=545.5s	545.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=546.1s	546.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=547.5s	547.5	 And he is just an excellent off-leash capable dog here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=551.7s	551.7	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=553.8s	553.8	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=554.9s	554.9	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=555.7s	555.7	 Again, just to remind you the toy is behind my back with him because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=558.3s	558.3	 he's so toy obsessed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=559.5s	559.5	 I really want the emphasis to be on my eyes and that eye contact and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=563.5s	563.5	 he's really learned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=564.2s	564.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=564.5s	564.5	 I stay close to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=565.6s	565.6	 I get the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=566.4s	566.4	 So many people have behavior problems because they're not doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=568.9s	568.9	 activities like this with their dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=570.8s	570.8	 If we weren't playing regular fetch with him like this, he most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=573.6s	573.6	 likely would be going after those squirrels running away not listening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=577.2s	577.2	 So that's why it's so important to give dogs like George an outlet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=580.8s	580.8	 to run and chase and bite things and work with a person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=585.2s	585.2	 Practice sit and stay around these Canada geese.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=587.5s	587.5	 He's still very interested in them, but we've made great progress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=590.5s	590.5	 in this area and I'm doing these like many bits of screensaver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=594.2s	594.2	 training with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=595.2s	595.2	 Let him take in the birds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=596.3s	596.3	 Let him see them and then hopefully be able to call his attention off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=599.4s	599.4	 of the birds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=600.5s	600.5	 George come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=603.1s	603.1	 Good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=605.8s	605.8	 Looks like he's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=607.1s	607.1	 I don't even think I need to give him a treat there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=608.5s	608.5	 Do you want a treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=609.2s	609.2	 I'll give you a treat if you want, but his environment, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=612.5s	612.5	 being able to explore and sniff around on the walk is something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=615.5s	615.5	 he really enjoys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=616.5s	616.5	 So we continue to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=618.1s	618.1	 How's he do on the bridge?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=620.1s	620.1	 I'm really like dragging my feet here for the last leg of our trip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=623.8s	623.8	 because I'm really enjoying this extra time with him on this beautiful

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=627.9s	627.9	 And of course our last park trip with George wouldn't be complete
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=631.1s	631.1	 if he didn't find some kind of random ball-like object to obsess
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=635.1s	635.1	 over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=635.6s	635.6	 Hopefully he'll remember how to resist something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=638.8s	638.8	 George found this thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=640.0s	640.0	 He thinks is a ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=641.0s	641.0	 It's actually part of an egg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=642.0s	642.0	 It looks like he's kind of pulling towards it right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=644.2s	644.2	 I want to see if I can call him off of that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=693.5s	693.5	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=696.8s	696.8	 So he was doing really well on his stay and eventually he got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=699.8s	699.8	 a little curious.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKownGuvjE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=189&pp=iAQB&t=870.8s	870.8	 to find out if my training with George would actually translate
