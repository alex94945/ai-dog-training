https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 One thing that I think Bri and I have discovered about this YouTube dog training series that we're doing is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 realism is what matters, realistic advice in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=10.4s	10.4	 And in our latest episode, I don't think we could have done that any better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=14.3s	14.3	 Same size as Veronica. That's a bear print. Zach is not turning around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=18.4s	18.4	 For example, if you haven't seen our current episode, we encounter bears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=22.7s	22.7	 I think we may have found that bear we were looking for earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=26.3s	26.3	 See the bear inertia?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=27.5s	27.5	 We encounter elk at feet away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=30.3s	30.3	 That was terrifying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 I wasn't filming, but this elk was so close to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=34.7s	34.7	 Of course, bison. All of that while standing on top of a super volcano.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 If you don't believe me, check out the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=40.8s	40.8	 But it's doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKsB9oXuNUI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=98&pp=iAQB&t=42.1s	42.1	 And I wanted to thank you guys.
