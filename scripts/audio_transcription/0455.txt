https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=10.2s	10.2	 I'll have a link below. A new dog can be an incredible addition to the family,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=14.4s	14.4	 but there's a few things you should consider before bringing a new dog into your life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=18.9s	18.9	 Getting a new dog means that you're gonna have a lot less time to do your regular daily activities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=23.5s	23.5	 The Rover app is awesome for those times when you need that little bit of extra help to give your dog the care and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 attention that they deserve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 You can get 24-7 access to pet care from in-home boarding to daycare, pet sitting, and even dog walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 And you can quickly book and pay all within the app.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=40.6s	40.6	 I think you accidentally just booked your own drop-in visit. You're paying for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=44.5s	44.5	 I wonder if we can get someone who's gonna let you bite them all day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 It's really great for those days when you have to be away from home a little bit longer than expected,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=50.9s	50.9	 and you need someone to drop in at the last minute to give your dog a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 So if you want Thursday, Friday, but not Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, and you've got two dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=59.5s	59.5	 you can adjust how much you're willing to spend here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=61.9s	61.9	 You can check out reviews, read detailed descriptions of how they'll interact with your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=65.7s	65.7	 or there's three people within six miles who have five stars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=68.9s	68.9	 And if it keeps your dog from destroying your house, it's probably money well spent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 They'll even send you a map of their exact walking route, complete with potty spots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=76.6s	76.6	 I mean, we really do live in an incredible time, don't we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 Visit rover.com slash Zach George and enter promo code Zach George when you check out,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=88.3s	88.3	 Before deciding whether or not you're ready to be a new dog parent, weigh the pros and cons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 I mean, almost every aspect of your life is going to be heavily influenced by the arrival of a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=98.1s	98.1	 There are three main things that I think are really important to consider before saying yes to a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 First, time. You have the time to raise a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=106.9s	106.9	 Raising the perfect pet takes serious time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=109.9s	109.9	 Your dog's going to need daily exercise, and I've found that you get the most bang for your buck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 when you exercise your dog early in the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=116.6s	116.6	 That means for most of you, you'll have to wake up earlier each day and give your dog the attention he needs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=121.2s	121.2	 before you go to work or start the rest of your day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=123.6s	123.6	 So if you work long hours, you'll need to bring your dog to doggie daycare, get a dog walker,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 or break up your shifts so that you can come home and give your dog a break yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 You'll have to commit to taking your dog all over the place, number one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=134.9s	134.9	 so that they can become well socialized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=137.1s	137.1	 And secondly, they can learn how to behave in all types of situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=141.1s	141.1	 I know, being a YouTube star is so much work, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=144.2s	144.2	 It takes about one year of really teaching a dog how to listen to you in lots of different scenarios
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=149.3s	149.3	 before you can expect them to generalize communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 And you know what? That takes a lot of your time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 Second, cost. I mean, sure, there's the adoption or breeder fee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=159.2s	159.2	 and that's usually between a hundred and up to thousands of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 Your initial vet visit, which can be a few hundred bucks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=165.3s	165.3	 general supplies, maybe a few hundred dollars, and spang or neutering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 Now, of course, a benefit to adopting a dog from a shelter or a rescue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=172.1s	172.1	 is that many of these initial costs and procedures are included in the adoption fee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=176.5s	176.5	 But look, these costs are insignificant compared to how much money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 you're going to have to spend on your dog over the course of their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=182.7s	182.7	 For example, a proper quality food can definitely be pricey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=185.7s	185.7	 Your dog's going to need yearly shots and monthly preventives like flea tick and heartworm pills,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=190.4s	190.4	 which are an additional several hundred dollars a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=192.5s	192.5	 And medical emergencies, well, they're not exactly rare,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=195.1s	195.1	 and they can cost at minimum hundreds of dollars, but more likely thousands of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=199.7s	199.7	 And over the course of your dog's life, their vet bills are likely to get more expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 So really think about whether or not you can afford to provide a lifetime of quality care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=207.8s	207.8	 And if you want help with professional training, well, that can get pretty expensive, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=211.2s	211.2	 But fortunately, I've got all of the free dog training content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=214.4s	214.4	 you could ever want right here on this YouTube channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=217.4s	217.4	 If you can afford these costs, that's really nothing compared to how much dogs really enrich our lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=222.6s	222.6	 Next, patience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=223.8s	223.8	 I mean, you've got to be prepared to be mega patient so that your dog can learn what you expect of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 Puppies are going to have to be potty trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=231.2s	231.2	 So that means that accidents are inevitable, as is the classic puppy biting phase,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 which can be a major inconvenience, and it can last for months if it goes unaddressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=240.4s	240.4	 And even if you do address it, it can still last for weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 The more patient you are, the faster your results will be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 I'm going to have a playlist in the description that will show you how to teach your dog all of the basics and beyond for free and in order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUkKVKgMbXM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=456&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 You're subscribed, right?
