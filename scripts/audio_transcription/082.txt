https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 but it was puppy biting that had gone unchecked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 With that adult strength,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=861.5s	861.5	 I still use it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=862.4s	862.4	 And yeah, and it seems to be working out okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=864.1s	864.1	 So maybe we are on the same page.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=865.4s	865.4	 Why does the leash trigger my dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=867.0s	867.0	 to have an outburst towards other dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=869.4s	869.4	 The reason a lot of dogs will start barking and lunging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=872.8s	872.8	 when on leash versus not being on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=875.7s	875.7	 is because it's very restrictive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=877.2s	877.2	 It can be very frustrating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=878.5s	878.5	 This is the thoughts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=882.6s	882.6	 So as someone, hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=884.9s	884.9	 Hi, cutie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=895.4s	895.4	 They can behave a bit more naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=897.2s	897.2	 They can pace back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=898.8s	898.8	 Go ahead a few feet, stop, smell something on the ground.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=902.3s	902.3	 It gives them a lot more freedom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=903.5s	903.5	 to interact with the world.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=907.2s	907.2	 You can always drive to a park, some old ball field.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=922.6s	922.6	 It's wide enough for a car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=923.8s	923.8	 So you have all that space and visibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=926.0s	926.0	 to really keep your eye out for animals and other dogs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=930.4s	930.4	 that a leash is restrictive to a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=932.8s	932.8	 and that can cause frustration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=934.3s	934.3	 And it takes time to teach them how to adjust to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=937.9s	937.9	 I think this goes without saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=939.3s	939.3	 but on leash greetings,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=944.2s	944.2	 I don't do on leash greetings.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=967.6s	967.6	 So are prong collars and e-collars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=969.4s	969.4	 I don't like prong collars or e-collars,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=973.7s	973.7	 rather than truly motivating a dog how to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=977.1s	977.1	 And the science indicates strongly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=979.3s	979.3	 that there are long-term welfare concerns

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=987.1s	987.1	 that all three of these things are illegal?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=989.8s	989.8	 It's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=990.6s	990.6	 We use crates.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=992.4s	992.4	 I frequently show people how to use crates,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=997.5s	997.5	 but they're all kind of put into that illegal category.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=999.8s	999.8	 So, I mean, what's going on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1001.0s	1001.0	 Am I behind the times?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1003.1s	1003.1	 Maybe crates are tomorrow's shock collars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1005.0s	1005.0	 I think it is easier to neglect a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1007.9s	1007.9	 when you have a dog-proof box to put them in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1010.0s	1010.0	 but are they inherently bad or neglectful?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1012.9s	1012.9	 It feels like there is no way to use a prong collar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1015.9s	1015.9	 or an e-collar, except as intended.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1022.0s	1022.0	 it's a safe box for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1023.7s	1023.7	 I suspect the reason it's illegal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1025.2s	1025.2	 is because of misuse of the crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1026.7s	1026.7	 and putting dogs in there for an extended period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1029.5s	1029.5	 and neglecting them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1030.3s	1030.3	 because dogs are very active animals in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1032.8s	1032.8	 They need to be able to walk and run,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1036.7s	1036.7	 without their quality of life really being reduced.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1041.0s	1041.0	 are kind of as a bedroom for a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1043.2s	1043.2	 I always use an oversized crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1045.2s	1045.2	 so they have plenty of room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1046.7s	1046.7	 I mean, Inersha right now, the door is wide open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1049.1s	1049.1	 Well, yeah, you saw her let herself into that crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1052.4s	1052.4	 when she wanted comfort, in fact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1054.1s	1054.1	 because we let her know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1055.2s	1055.2	 that she was not gonna have to take a bath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1056.9s	1056.9	 and she chose to go in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1058.1s	1058.1	 So I'd say in Inersha's case, that's her happy place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1061.3s	1061.3	 That's where she goes when she wants to feel comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1063.1s	1063.1	 Yeah, I mean, I don't ever have to force her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sr4fJwkC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1064.8s	1064.8	 into a crate or anything like that.
