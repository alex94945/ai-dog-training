https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=1.9s	1.9	 It is so easy to make mistakes when house training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=5.2s	5.2	 Today, I'm going to cover the five most common mistakes people make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=8.7s	8.7	 when house training a new puppy or dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 Click thumbs up if you've got a new dog and make sure you're subscribed to my channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=14.6s	14.6	 In the description of this video, I'm going to have a playlist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=17.4s	17.4	 that will show you how to teach your dog all of the basics and beyond in order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=21.6s	21.6	 Now, that's completely free, as is all of my video content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=24.9s	24.9	 And my book Dog Training Revolution will bring you up to speed, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=28.7s	28.7	 Keeping your dog on a consistent feeding schedule can make a really big difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=32.7s	32.7	 when it comes to potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=34.3s	34.3	 After all, if you know their eating schedule, you'll more likely be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=37.4s	37.4	 to anticipate when they need to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 Don't risk having to switch up your puppy's food too much just because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=42.8s	42.8	 the store is out of your regular brand of food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=44.8s	44.8	 Pet Flow will make sure that your puppy's favorite brand of food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 is at your front door automatically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=49.6s	49.6	 Choose your brand of dog food and how often you want to deliver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=52.7s	52.7	 Enter code ZAK30 when you check out and you'll get $10 off your first three orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=57.3s	57.3	 Now let's meet Hazel and Liz.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=59.4s	59.4	 My name is Liz London. This is our new puppy Hazel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 I live here with my husband and our two kids and our other dog, Benye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 So far, Hazel is your typical puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=68.3s	68.3	 She's either ready to play or she's passed out sleeping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Things are going great, but we would like some help with potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=74.2s	74.2	 Zach, please give me some help on potty training Hazel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=77.5s	77.5	 The first mistake that many people make when house training a new dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=81.2s	81.2	 is thinking that potty training can be done in the first week or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 But actually, it can take several months of consistency before you're out of the woods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 Relapses are more common than you might think, so don't let your guard down just yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=92.5s	92.5	 Next, have you ever heard that a surefire way to correct a dog when house training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=96.3s	96.3	 is to show their mess to them or even go as far as to rub their nose in it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 or scold them when you catch them in the act?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 Now, not only is that a primitive way to communicate with a smart animal like a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 but it's far from being proactive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=108.3s	108.3	 If you catch your dog having an accident in the house, then that mistake is on you, not them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=112.8s	112.8	 So just clean it up and do a better job at supervising your dog and controlling their environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=118.7s	118.7	 which is the next easy to make mistake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=121.5s	121.5	 Controlling your dog's access to various parts of the house is essential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=125.3s	125.3	 if you're serious about house training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=127.1s	127.1	 In fact, this is one of the most important things to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=130.5s	130.5	 The best way to control your dog's access to the house is to have the leash attached to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 Those who do this get success way quicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=138.5s	138.5	 When you're unable to give your dog your full attention or have them attach to you with a leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=142.7s	142.7	 you'll have to make sure they have a safe puppy-proofed area to hang out in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 where you can tolerate any accidents while you're potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=148.8s	148.8	 Bottom line, you must control access to the house 100% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 The next mistake that many of us make is expecting our dogs to let us know when they have to go out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=159.1s	159.1	 As you get to know your dog, you'll be able to anticipate when they're asking you to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 But for now, it's really unreasonable to put that responsibility on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=167.3s	167.3	 It's your responsibility to let your dog outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 In fact, you can't let them out too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=172.3s	172.3	 Ideally, you should be letting your dog out every single hour when you're at home and awake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 and every few hours overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=178.2s	178.2	 Lucky for Liz, she's got two kids who will split the overnight work with her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 so between the three of them, they can each just wake up once per night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=185.1s	185.1	 See if you can get your family to take shifts too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=187.4s	187.4	 Don't worry, you'll only have to do this the first few weeks that you have your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 As their bladder matures and as they get used to a routine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 they'll be able to go through the whole night without being let out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=196.3s	196.3	 Are potty pads and paper training a mistake?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=199.1s	199.1	 Well, it depends who you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 Puppy pads and paper training can be great for a lot of situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 Maybe you live in a high-rise apartment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=205.6s	205.6	 or maybe it's really difficult for you to let your dog out during the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 But if you don't have a really specific reason for using puppy pads,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=211.6s	211.6	 then I'd say just bypass this step altogether and take them directly outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 See, puppies seem to develop a preference towards certain textures,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=219.8s	219.8	 whether that's grass, concrete or your carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=222.8s	222.8	 It's best to potty train your dog from the beginning on whatever texture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 they'll generally be using for the rest of their life,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=228.7s	228.7	 which for most dogs is grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQpsakJonsU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=488&pp=iAQB&t=230.9s	230.9	 So if this is you, skip this unnecessary step.
