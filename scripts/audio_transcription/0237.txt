https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=56.1s	56.1	 One thing is easier than ever, and that's getting your puppy's food and supplies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 You can now have everything you need automatically shipped to your front door from Petflo,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=69.8s	69.8	 When you enter my special code, ZAK30, you're going to save $10 on your first three automatic shipments.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 She does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=87.9s	87.9	 Good work, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=89.2s	89.2	 Little things like that really build a puppy's confidence in the new world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 Now, today we are at City Park in New Orleans, and we are going to give Kona some exposure

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=126.7s	126.7	 of her training, but I'm not going to rush the socialization process here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=130.5s	130.5	 This is extremely valuable for a 13-week-old dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=134.5s	134.5	 We're walking that fine line here where she's going to encounter scents on the ground,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=138.7s	138.7	 but I would prefer her not to get totally fixated on them like we're seeing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=142.5s	142.5	 So let's go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 I'm just going to block it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=147.4s	147.4	 Okay, come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 One of the really interesting things about this park are the fact that you have many

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 Nice job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=215.3s	215.3	 out of the gate when you're coming into a new place with an inexperienced dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=268.8s	268.8	 City Park has the largest collection of live oak trees anywhere in the known world,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=277.3s	277.3	 sideways.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=280.8s	280.8	 Look at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=281.4s	281.4	 Yeah, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=283.6s	283.6	 What is this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=284.2s	284.2	 Come on, let's go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=286.7s	286.7	 Come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=287.7s	287.7	 Can you do it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=289.5s	289.5	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=291.8s	291.8	 Come on, you can do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 You can do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=293.4s	293.4	 Come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 At this age, dogs are really learning how to use their body in many different ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=300.3s	300.3	 And it's always gratifying to see them do something like that for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 Because when she first encountered it, she's like, huh, I don't know if I can do anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=306.9s	306.9	 with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=307.3s	307.3	 And then she eventually just jumped right over it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=309.4s	309.4	 And look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=310.2s	310.2	 Second time, it's nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=311.4s	311.4	 She goes right over it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=312.6s	312.6	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 Adventure dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=314.6s	314.6	 Nice work, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=316.4s	316.4	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=318.0s	318.0	 What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=320.3s	320.3	 So I'm luring her with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=321.7s	321.7	 Again, another benefit to lure training here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 You can easily guide them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=325.4s	325.4	 Look at you being so confident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=330.6s	330.6	 And you can see she's having to fine tune her balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=333.6s	333.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=334.7s	334.7	 Let's go back the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=335.6s	335.6	 Kona, just little exercises like this go a long way towards teaching your dog how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=340.0s	340.0	 to be more confident in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=341.8s	341.8	 And you get so much bang for your buck when you do this with a young puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=346.0s	346.0	 Come on, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=347.9s	347.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=349.5s	349.5	 And I'm just giving her a treat for an added bonus there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=352.6s	352.6	 Let's go see what else we can get into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=354.3s	354.3	 Wildlife is one of the more interesting things to train your dog around because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=358.2s	358.2	 they have erratic interesting movements to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 Although look, she's just like, eh, OK, meh, they're birds, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=364.4s	364.4	 Really healthy reaction to the birds right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=366.6s	366.6	 Pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=367.4s	367.4	 Really good reaction to people walking by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=369.3s	369.3	 I mean, very interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=370.6s	370.6	 See, she started to walk towards them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 I didn't even need to restrain her, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=373.4s	373.4	 She's like, I'll stay over here, which is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=376.6s	376.6	 I like the fact that she's staying near me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=378.4s	378.4	 We'll see if that sticks over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=380.2s	380.2	 Let me see if I can get her attention on me around these birds here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=383.5s	383.5	 Just so I know where I stand as a trainer with her right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=386.8s	386.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=387.8s	387.8	 I mean, I just got into her area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=389.1s	389.1	 She's like, oh, there's that man again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 When I see him, he gives me treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=392.2s	392.2	 And that's really the kind of logic and part that we're trying to build into our dog here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=396.6s	396.6	 Like, look, pay attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=397.8s	397.8	 Good things are going to come your way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 But you can also chill out and observe the world, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=401.8s	401.8	 Ultimately, as your dog matures and gets older, you want them to listen to you in places like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=406.6s	406.6	 But it's not really reasonable to expect them to listen to you reliably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=410.6s	410.6	 if they're not used to being in places like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=412.8s	412.8	 But if they've been seeing parks and interesting settings like this their entire life,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=417.2s	417.2	 then they're far more likely to be compliant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=419.8s	419.8	 Now, if you have an older dog and you haven't gone through this effort, that's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=422.8s	422.8	 It's never too late to start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=424.7s	424.7	 Dogs of any age can benefit from socialization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=427.8s	427.8	 You can see she was thrown off by that dog, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=431.0s	431.0	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=432.1s	432.1	 But she reacted well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=434.0s	434.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=434.8s	434.8	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=435.3s	435.3	 It's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=437.8s	437.8	 It looks like somebody has left actual lettuce out here for the birds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=442.5s	442.5	 Might be fun to practice a leave it with this organic matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=447.3s	447.3	 Kona.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=451.8s	451.8	 Leave it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=457.0s	457.0	 Combo right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=458.2s	458.2	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=469.4s	469.4	 Too much there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=470.1s	470.1	 See, we have a passing crowd over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=472.2s	472.2	 So, I mean, that was an example where I tried to get her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=474.8s	474.8	 She's a little too distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=476.0s	476.0	 I'm going to let that one slide right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=478.2s	478.2	 Again, given that she has so much inexperience in an environment like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=482.8s	482.8	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=483.1s	483.1	 Let's move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=483.7s	483.7	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=486.2s	486.2	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=491.0s	491.0	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=491.5s	491.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=491.9s	491.9	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=492.6s	492.6	 An example there where she was trying to lag behind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=495.4s	495.4	 She was really interested in the lettuce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=497.3s	497.3	 I didn't pull her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=498.2s	498.2	 I got her to voluntarily come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=499.4s	499.4	 Now, there would be no harm in assisting your dog physically and saying, come on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=502.6s	502.6	 let's go already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=503.5s	503.5	 But if you're feeling extra patient and you can get your dog to go through the motions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=507.4s	507.4	 all by themselves with a little bit of encouragement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=509.9s	509.9	 it's probably going to be a more potent training instance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=512.6s	512.6	 Training a puppy is far more than sit, stay, come down, potty training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=516.5s	516.5	 stop biting and stop jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=518.1s	518.1	 It's also about getting compliance in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=521.2s	521.2	 But before you can get compliance out here, they have to know what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=524.7s	524.7	 They have to exist within it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=526.2s	526.2	 If you're new to raising a puppy or training a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=528.7s	528.7	 it's really easy to intuitively take big steps in your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=532.7s	532.7	 In other words, come out here, run through everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=534.9s	534.9	 you think they know that they do at home,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=536.8s	536.8	 and expect them to comply just as they do in your living room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=539.6s	539.6	 And that's not always realistic because environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=542.1s	542.1	 remember, will throw a dog off more than anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=545.8s	545.8	 Kona, yeah, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=551.0s	551.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=553.6s	553.6	 And so in this case, rather than giving her a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=556.0s	556.0	 she was content to keep exploring and that was like exciting enough to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=561.0s	561.0	 Let me give you guys an update on her potty training and how that's going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=564.5s	564.5	 So I think potty training could be going better than it currently is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=567.9s	567.9	 And I blame myself completely for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=569.9s	569.9	 So most of the accidents that she has had inside the house occur,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=573.8s	573.8	 well, number one, when we're filming and I'm a bit distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=576.6s	576.6	 But I've been letting her and Inersha and Indy play so much while in the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=581.9s	581.9	 that a number of accidents have occurred when I've kind of let my guard down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=586.3s	586.3	 and they're playing together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=587.4s	587.4	 Normally, I'll keep a dog on leash and under very strict supervision in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=591.7s	591.7	 But with her being the age she is and her inertia hitting it off so well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=596.3s	596.3	 I really think that social experience with an older dog is so incredibly valuable to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=602.1s	602.1	 So I've been letting her get in a disproportionate amount of playtime with Inersha too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=607.1s	607.1	 So what I'm doing to fix that is I'm going to encourage their play sessions to occur
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=610.6s	610.6	 more outside or when I do have her inside, I'm going to have her on a 10-foot tie out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=615.2s	615.2	 because they've been learning how to kind of play with that limitation in place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=618.4s	618.4	 And they've been doing pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=619.7s	619.7	 The less range she has to get around the house, the less likely an accident is to occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=624.0s	624.0	 But the lesson I've taken from all of this are puppies are fast, but they pee even faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=630.6s	630.6	 One of the things that's helping us out a little bit too is that I've put the WizSmart P-pads down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=636.4s	636.4	 so that she has easy access to those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=638.8s	638.8	 That combined with her 10-foot tie out while in the house means she has very obvious access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=644.4s	644.4	 to the P-pads, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=645.6s	645.6	 She really gravitates to those pads because we've been introducing them to her from a young age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=650.2s	650.2	 I have definitely become a fan of pad training because it does give you a lot of options
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=654.8s	654.8	 moving forward like bad weather or if you live in a high-rise, you really have that extra option
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=660.0s	660.0	 for your dog to go potty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=661.2s	661.2	 And dogs can learn to do both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=662.5s	662.5	 They can learn to go on the pads and go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=664.6s	664.6	 So it only gives you options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=666.0s	666.0	 And you know that I'm a huge fan of creating lots of options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=669.1s	669.1	 If you're wondering what kind of pads to use, I definitely recommend WizSmart pads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=672.6s	672.6	 Once you get them, you'll see what I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=673.8s	673.8	 They're the thickest, most absorbent pads around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=676.2s	676.2	 They stick on the ground and really hold their position pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=679.6s	679.6	 I'll have a link in the description, wizsmart.com slash Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=682.6s	682.6	 And you can use code ZACH10 to get 10% off and get free shipping too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=687.0s	687.0	 So the other day we were teaching Kona how to go up and down stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=690.3s	690.3	 But stairs are a thing that actually trip up a lot of puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=693.4s	693.4	 They don't know how to deal with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=694.6s	694.6	 It might sound funny, but giving them practice and experience with stairs is quite important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=699.3s	699.3	 Here's a real life example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=700.5s	700.5	 Let's see if she has generalized doing stairs yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=703.4s	703.4	 You can see she's like hyper aware of her environment here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=706.2s	706.2	 Look at, see, it's a little awkward for her to do stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=709.0s	709.0	 But she's doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=710.8s	710.8	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=711.8s	711.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=712.6s	712.6	 You can tell she's just learned how to do stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=715.0s	715.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=715.3s	715.3	 I even got a free sit right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=717.9s	717.9	 Ah, now let's do these other stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=722.7s	722.7	 I want to make sure she doesn't go jumping in the water though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=726.5s	726.5	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=731.0s	731.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=731.9s	731.9	 You did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=733.9s	733.9	 You did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=735.4s	735.4	 And here we'll let her go up to the edge and at least see what she can discover and take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=739.5s	739.5	 in about this water here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=740.6s	740.6	 She's just interested in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=742.0s	742.0	 So coming down the stairs is one thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=743.8s	743.8	 Let's see if she can remember how to go up the stairs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=755.5s	755.5	 She goes right up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=756.9s	756.9	 Nice job, girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=761.2s	761.2	 We have the occasional dog walking by.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=766.6s	766.6	 So I think we've been here long enough and I think Kona has somewhat adjusted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=771.1s	771.1	 We're going to find out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=776.2s	776.2	 We can start with leave it because she's eating grass.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=817.8s	817.8	 but we can't eat grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=819.0s	819.0	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=819.6s	819.6	 Come here, girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=832.6s	832.6	 Yeah, kind of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=833.8s	833.8	 How about this way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=834.7s	834.7	 Good job, girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=840.1s	840.1	 So proud of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=841.2s	841.2	 Sit, stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=850.2s	850.2	 So I'm loving how that looked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=851.4s	851.4	 I mean, that looked like a professional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=852.9s	852.9	 Sit, stay and come.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=857.3s	857.3	 to bolt on me in this particular section of the park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=859.9s	859.9	 Come is looking good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=860.9s	860.9	 Stay is looking good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=861.9s	861.9	 I like to test those pretty often because they're potentially life-saving skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=865.8s	865.8	 Let's talk a little bit about the proper mindset to have when you're teaching a dog like Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=869.8s	869.8	 It's really important to summon genuine optimism even when your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=874.2s	874.2	 isn't behaving exactly as you want them to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=876.6s	876.6	 They learn extremely quickly and they can tell when you're being authentic versus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=880.8s	880.8	 being fake or impatient or non-genuine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=883.8s	883.8	 Think about the different relationships you had when you were a kid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=886.6s	886.6	 Maybe some teachers were easier to get along with and communicate with than others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=891.5s	891.5	 Maybe you had one parent that was more permissive than another parent and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=895.1s	895.1	 learned how to behave contextually in that particular instance, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=899.4s	899.4	 Dogs are no different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=900.6s	900.6	 I mean, keep in mind Kona has been on this planet less than four months and that's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=904.3s	904.3	 a lot of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=905.2s	905.2	 So whenever you're struggling with your dog, really put yourself in their position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=908.2s	908.2	 to the best of your ability and ask yourself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=910.5s	910.5	 is it really reasonable for them to be doing what you're asking them to do with their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=914.5s	914.5	 current level of experience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=916.0s	916.0	 But I think that you'll find when you really summon that genuine energy when you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=919.6s	919.6	 working with your dog that you'll get much better results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=922.9s	922.9	 So some of the tips I like to give people who are new to training dogs are use a quiet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=926.9s	926.9	 voice.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=931.1s	931.1	 to perform better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=932.2s	932.2	 Speak normally and intelligently when you're talking to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=935.2s	935.2	 Try to avoid thinking that your dog can only understand really simple words or phrases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=939.4s	939.4	 In fact, dogs can understand thousands of words.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=941.9s	941.9	 Naturally, you won't want to overwhelm them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=943.8s	943.8	 And there's nothing wrong with teaching a basic concept when they're young, but you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=946.8s	946.8	 can really evolve that communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=949.0s	949.0	 And over time, they'll learn to understand very complex concepts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=952.2s	952.2	 One thing I'd like to work on here is see if we can get her to sit, hold her stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=957.4s	957.4	 I like when a dog can stand on all fours, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=960.6s	960.6	 And I'm working on teaching her to stand without advancing these feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=964.6s	964.6	 So you see how I'm like creating discs because she's so fixated on the treat right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=968.6s	968.6	 which is normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=969.4s	969.4	 We're just trying to build a little bit more time to get her to hold that stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=972.8s	972.8	 I think it's important for dogs to know how to stay in a variety of positions, whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=976.6s	976.6	 that's sit or lie down or stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=978.7s	978.7	 So that's something you can work on to like teach your dog to generally understand stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=983.4s	983.4	 in different positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=984.6s	984.6	 So like really trying to zoom in on those half second successes is something that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=989.4s	989.4	 not very natural.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=990.7s	990.7	 As people, if we're not used to this, we tend to insist on more than is reasonably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=997.4s	997.4	 possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0j32IJ6IY4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=997.9s	997.9	 Look at how these feet are not advancing forward.
