https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmuU46lNzIs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=28&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 When I say these relevant academic bodies, I'm talking about veterinary behavior organizations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmuU46lNzIs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=28&pp=iAQB&t=13.1s	13.1	 who make recommendations on how dogs should be trained for people who don't have medical

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmuU46lNzIs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=28&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 They have a position statement, all of them do, on how dogs should be trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmuU46lNzIs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=28&pp=iAQB&t=28.1s	28.1	 And so those are the relevant academic bodies I'm always referring to, like the American

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmuU46lNzIs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=28&pp=iAQB&t=35.9s	35.9	 Those are who dog trainers are supposed to look to for guidance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmuU46lNzIs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=28&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 And when dog trainers unilaterally say, man, I'll take it as a recommendation, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmuU46lNzIs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=28&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 my view that dog trainers should not have the right to supersede advice like that because

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmuU46lNzIs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=28&pp=iAQB&t=53.1s	53.1	 The more we educate people on the main dog training methods, hopefully they'll get treated
