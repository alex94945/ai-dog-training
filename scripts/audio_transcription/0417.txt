https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Thank you to PetFlow for supporting today's episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=2.2s	2.2	 Regardless of the size of your dog, you're gonna have to get them everything they need,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 like their food and their supplies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 And there's no more convenient way to get those things than through PetFlow, especially food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=11.6s	11.6	 You pick out your dog's favorite food one time, and then you tell PetFlow to ship it to you every two weeks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=16.2s	16.2	 or three weeks, or whatever you prefer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 Enter code ZACH30 when you check out, you'll get $10 off your first three orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 I'm gonna have a special link in that code in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=24.3s	24.3	 Click thumbs up for Pepper, the two to three year old rescue dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=27.4s	27.4	 Make sure you're subscribed to my channel and pick up a copy of my number one best-selling book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 I'll have a link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=32.7s	32.7	 It's a fair question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 Is teaching a smaller dog or a bigger dog easier or harder? Or does it matter?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 In today's video, I'm gonna show you some of the differences when working with a bigger dog versus a smaller dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=43.5s	43.5	 on things like the basics, tricks, and even some of the most common behavior problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=47.7s	47.7	 First, understand that teaching small dogs versus big dogs is a lot more similar than it is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=52.6s	52.6	 And just because you have a small dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=54.7s	54.7	 well, that doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to be lower maintenance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 Remember, a dog's energy level, not their size and not their breed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 is probably the most important factor that you need to consider when raising them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 Pepper's energy level is around a 1.5 out of 3.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 She's relatively low energy, but she has bursts of energy here and there throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=73.6s	73.6	 And that tells me where I need to start with her training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 Teaching many small dogs to lie down is a bit different than teaching larger dogs to lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Maybe that's because they're already so close to the ground that they just don't see the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 See, this is how I usually lure dogs into a down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 but many small dogs and even some big dogs don't naturally follow the lure this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 So here's a few tips if your dog is like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 Go slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=95.6s	95.6	 See, when you're new to teaching dogs, the most intuitive way to lure a dog into a down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=100.2s	100.2	 is to hold the treat up and go real fast like that, and then hope that they go into the down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=104.7s	104.7	 But you can see that's not really having much of an effect with Pepper here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=108.1s	108.1	 But Pepper doesn't eagerly follow the lure into the down position even when you do go slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=113.4s	113.4	 So if that's you, try luring them in different directions like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=116.7s	116.7	 There you can see she's like, I don't really want to lie down, but I want that chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=120.3s	120.3	 So I'm just going to keep it there, just like a magnet attached to her nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 I'm just releasing tiny little bits of chicken here with my index finger and my thumb as she stays with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=130.6s	130.6	 She's not quite into a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 You can see this isn't yet on the ground, this part of her leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=135.4s	135.4	 I'm going to...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=136.6s	136.6	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=137.3s	137.3	 I'll take that, lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 I'm going to give her a little extra while she's there just to really reinforce that I like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=143.8s	143.8	 she's down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 You can go through their front legs, sometimes that helps, especially with smaller dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=148.2s	148.2	 That was a great example right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 You saw her just kind of fall into the down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 I'm not too concerned whether it's accidental or not because the bottom line is that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 achieve the position and you want to be there to acknowledge that you like that they're in that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=160.1s	160.1	 But even if you have a bigger dog who's reluctant to follow a lure or not quite going all the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 into a down, you can still use this method too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=167.1s	167.1	 That is the art of the lure right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=170.2s	170.2	 Good job, you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 You're perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 This can often take several training sessions, so don't be discouraged if your dog doesn't pop into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=176.5s	176.5	 a down on your first few attempts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 Just keep experimenting to find out what works for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 And remember, being a good teacher requires you to be flexible and spontaneous regardless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 of which size they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=186.4s	186.4	 All dogs should learn tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 I mean, it's good for mental stimulation, plus it builds the communication between you and your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=192.4s	192.4	 But here's a trick that I really enjoy teaching to small dogs a lot of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=196.2s	196.2	 Let's see if we can get Pepper to stand on her hind legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 Look at that stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=200.3s	200.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=200.8s	200.8	 She's kind of using her paws to balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=202.9s	202.9	 That's a start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=204.1s	204.1	 And I'm just letting her nibble just the tiniest little bits as I go to really keep her interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=209.4s	209.4	 Let me see if I can get her to not hold on to my hand here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=213.3s	213.3	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 Oh, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 She only stood for a second, but that is exactly where you need to start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=218.5s	218.5	 Now that we have momentum, let's see if we can get it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=220.8s	220.8	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=221.3s	221.3	 Oh, good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=222.4s	222.4	 So now that she's getting the hang of stand, let's see if we can encourage her to take a step forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=227.1s	227.1	 She went backwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=227.9s	227.9	 I'll take that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=228.9s	228.9	 Sometimes it's more natural for a dog to walk backwards on their hinds than it is forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 Look at that forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=234.5s	234.5	 I'm sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 I'm going to try not to get so excited when I work with her because she's a bit more sensitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=239.1s	239.1	 Whereas if I was working with a crazy high energy lab here, I'd be acting ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 That's two steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 I'm rewarding her for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 Come on, give me another one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=248.2s	248.2	 Yes, little circus dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=250.2s	250.2	 You're awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=251.0s	251.0	 And it can take your dog a little while to build up the muscle memory to do this for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=254.6s	254.6	 more sustained periods of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=256.2s	256.2	 So be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=257.1s	257.1	 So what about just listening in general?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=258.8s	258.8	 I mean, lots of people tend to tolerate things from smaller dogs that they might not with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=262.6s	262.6	 larger dogs, like jumping on guests or pulling on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=266.5s	266.5	 But is that OK?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q60_mXlyb4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=418&pp=iAQB&t=267.6s	267.6	 It's easier to control or ignore a smaller dog when you have to.
