https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=2.1s	2.1	 I'm very impressed at your strength.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=3.8s	3.8	 Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 You said you worked out for Moira,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=5.9s	5.9	 but I feel like you might have needed to work out more for George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 Well, Moira was my workout for George, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=11.4s	11.4	 Oh my gosh. What is George the workout for?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=16.2s	16.2	 We've traveled to the last frontier to take on a rescue project like we've never done before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 The single worst thing that has ever happened in my dog training career.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=30.7s	30.7	 Just happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=38.2s	38.2	 This is Chop, a wild Alaskan dog who grew up wandering the streets of a remote,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=43.7s	43.7	 isolated northern village. This dog has literally never been inside a house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=53.1s	53.1	 He's a completely untrained adult dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=56.3s	56.3	 He's had very limited interactions with humans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 I mean, his teeth are huge and strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 Inertia, my own dog, may never be the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 There's no doubt if she does have a negative experience, it will likely set us back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=72.4s	72.4	 You know, I think we might have accidentally let a wolf into our house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=76.6s	76.6	 Chop will force me out of my comfort zone and challenge me as a trainer like never before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 Come here. 15 minutes ago, I was ready to quit being a dog trainer forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=92.9s	92.9	 So I'm a little discouraged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=95.7s	95.7	 We were talking about how much we already love him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=100.1s	100.1	 So it's like, here we go again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=101.8s	101.8	 Giving a dog that's almost 100 pounds their first bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 It's like washing an SUV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 Here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=109.7s	109.7	 That's you. What do you think of you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 We can't fail this dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=124.1s	124.1	 He's really thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=125.4s	125.4	 Good man! There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 But we're getting somewhere here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=138.7s	138.7	 How about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=146.2s	146.2	 Starting to understand stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 Here we are in the final stages of this series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=153.3s	153.3	 I felt like in that moment, every bit of training I had done with him was meaningless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=159.5s	159.5	 I would sincerely feel quite guilty if he misses out on a home like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 because I didn't prepare him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=168.4s	168.4	 A nightmare scenario unfolded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 This is reality dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJMdH-mrHsI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=185&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 Subscribe and click the bell.
