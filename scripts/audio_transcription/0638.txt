https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Dogs are responsive to learning from us as humans, at least in the beginning stages,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 in the following order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=9.5s	9.5	 Through our eye contact and our body language, and then finally the spoken word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 You would not want to go eye to eye or get into a dog's area unless you knew them very,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=19.5s	19.5	 very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=20.6s	20.6	 Every dog is different, but I'm recommending this for the overwhelming percentage of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=25.7s	25.7	 who have a good relationship with our dog and know that they are likely to react well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=31.3s	31.3	 when we engage them in this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=33.2s	33.2	 One of the first things that I like to teach a dog in a class is how to look at us in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=36.3s	36.3	 eye on command, and that's what we're doing today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 By teaching our dogs to look at us in the eye, that accomplishes a couple of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 We're able to build communication with them in order to teach them moving forward, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 we're also able to build a bond with them through eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 Dogs naturally look us in the eye, but I want them to be able to do it when we ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=55.2s	55.2	 Pulling up a treat directly to my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=57.3s	57.3	 I want you to look at my training bubble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=58.8s	58.8	 The training bubble is something that allows us to get fast, fast results with our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=63.6s	63.6	 That is the distance between our eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=66.6s	66.6	 The closer that is initially, the faster our dogs will respond by and large.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=72.2s	72.2	 Over time, we stretch that bubble larger and larger, but it has to be done slowly or else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=76.8s	76.8	 it pops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=79.1s	79.1	 So when we have eye contact, we're going to do two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 We're going to say the words, watch me or look at me, and then we're going to click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=85.6s	85.6	 as if to say that made the clicker go off when you were looking at me in the eye because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 I like that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 You're a smart dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 It looks like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=97.4s	97.4	 Watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=98.4s	98.4	 Watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=99.4s	99.4	 Watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 No, what we don't say is watch me, watch me, watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=103.5s	103.5	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=104.5s	104.5	 Chewy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 Wait, wait, no, don't repeat his name over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=107.2s	107.2	 And then watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=108.2s	108.2	 Yeah, beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=109.2s	109.2	 Like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=110.2s	110.2	 Yep, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=111.4s	111.4	 Now say watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 Watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=113.4s	113.4	 Watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 Click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=115.4s	115.4	 Boom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=116.4s	116.4	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 You got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=118.4s	118.4	 That's exactly right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 Now we've got them in the habit of looking up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=120.4s	120.4	 We want to start to phase out the treat and phase in the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=126.7s	126.7	 Everything we teach our dogs, we accompany with some type of visual hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=130.3s	130.3	 And I'm not talking about proper hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=132.4s	132.4	 They can be anything you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 You make them up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 You do what you're comfortable doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 This is how I tell a dog to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 This is how I tell a dog to look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 Now this accomplishes a couple of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=142.8s	142.8	 The reason, there's sound reason behind this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=146.2s	146.2	 A, most dogs are heavily, heavily receptive to exaggerated body language in addition to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=153.3s	153.3	 verbal language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=154.3s	154.3	 But initially we use our hands to communicate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 If you were going to talk to somebody who didn't know English for the first time, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 might use a lot of body language to explain something to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=163.7s	163.7	 That's very much what we're doing with our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=165.8s	165.8	 And we're going to accompany it with words.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 So in this case, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 Now it's going to be, watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=176.4s	176.4	 Treats coming from down here this time or wherever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 It's not coming from my eyes anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=179.5s	179.5	 Do you understand?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 We're shifting the emphasis from look at the treat to look into my eyes and the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=185.5s	185.5	 coming from over here now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=186.7s	186.7	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 Because ultimately we want our dogs focused on us, not food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=190.8s	190.8	 So this is how we bridge that gap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 Watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Oh, look at that stare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 That, I mean, this is what we're going for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=196.6s	196.6	 Also, do you see how I'm still hunched over here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 I'm still got a nice tight training bubble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 This line between our eyes is still very close and very direct and very engaging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 Being engaging with our dogs is critical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=208.8s	208.8	 We can't be robotic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=210.8s	210.8	 It's not about a step-by-step process here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=212.5s	212.5	 It's about really engaging our own individual dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=214.8s	214.8	 And I think all of you know how to do that very, very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=216.7s	216.7	 We just want to get that initial bit of eye contact at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 And then we want to build on that over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=223.8s	223.8	 Yes, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=224.9s	224.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=225.9s	225.9	 And boom, perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=226.9s	226.9	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=228.1s	228.1	 Yes, good, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=230.2s	230.2	 And build on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 That's your foundation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=232.4s	232.4	 That's your brick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=233.4s	233.4	 Brie, if I was single, would you not immediately be drawn to me if I had this with me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=239.5s	239.5	 Watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=240.5s	240.5	 Yes, do you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=242.2s	242.2	 Nice and tight, nice and close here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 That's where the reason that's, there's a lack of engagement between you guys right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=247.7s	247.7	 because you're too far apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=248.7s	248.7	 And with your dog being this small, I don't expect you to get down on the ground eye to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PogCb_mLc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=639&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 eye here.
