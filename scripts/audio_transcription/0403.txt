https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=26.4s	26.4	 It's probably going to make things way easier for you. All you do is go to pet flow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=30.2s	30.2	 I'll have a link in the description choose your favorite brand of food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 Tell them how often you'd like it to be delivered every two to three weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=36.4s	36.4	 For example and enter code zac30 when you check out to get ten dollars off your first three orders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 So you can try it out. See how you like it. I'll have all the links below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=44.8s	44.8	 Lucy is 10 years old miles is eight years old and their dog luna is like five or six months old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 So this should be an interesting experience in general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=52.6s	52.6	 Their mom's just trying to get some advice for how to involve the kids with training and what they should be focusing on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 And how to get her to basically pay attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=60.3s	60.3	 You know how it is with a puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=61.4s	61.4	 It can be tough my sense is that it can be a very distracting environment for luna to pay attention in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 So we're hoping to get some traction with the kids to get them a little bit more involved with training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 But just as I always tell parents ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 It's the adult's responsibility to teach the dog how to behave and then pass that knowledge on to the kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=78.3s	78.3	 So hopefully we can make some progress in that area. So how long have you guys had luna?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 Christmas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 You see how she's putting her feet down like that and poking her butt up in the air
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=91.8s	91.8	 That's called a play bow. That's what that's called. It usually means dogs want to play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 Mom is saying that training the family dog with kids has been challenging. I can't imagine why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 So wow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 Oh boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=110.6s	110.6	 You guys got a long way to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=116.4s	116.4	 I'm not sure what that is right here in this case where she gets a hold of something she's not supposed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=128.1s	128.1	 Yes, good that's very good I appreciate that you simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 It's good. Nice work. So not only did I get her to let go I showed her the behavior that I prefer instead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=137.8s	137.8	 Stay leave it alone, please
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 Yes, good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=146.4s	146.4	 To teach your dog a generalized leave it where they because it's one thing to teach them to leave the turkey alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 But that doesn't spill over into other training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 So now i'm going to teach her i'll leave a shoe alone. Stay leave it alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=161.1s	161.1	 Your shoe is demonstration up here look at me, please leave the shoe alone up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=167.7s	167.7	 Yes, that's very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 Leave it i'm bringing motion to it to make it more tempting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=173.9s	173.9	 Stay leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=175.8s	175.8	 Look at me. Oh, that was really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 Leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=183.4s	183.4	 Too far too far that time but again, that's where you find that line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=186.7s	186.7	 What's too much and what's not in this case if you were at home and you weren't feeling like dealing with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 It would be okay. You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=193.6s	193.6	 If you are gonna let her run around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=195.6s	195.6	 It's okay to run around on leash like this. She's a lot easier to get to so over here luna left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=201.2s	201.2	 Oh, please over here, please. Come here. Sit stay. You need to leave his shoe alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=207.6s	207.6	 I mean I talk to him like that just like a five-year-old not his responsibility to keep that happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=212.7s	212.7	 you know because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 It's he's got a lot on his plate, you know, he's got to grow up himself and do school and friends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 You know, there's a lot of things there usually I sit with like kids under about 13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 It's not reasonable to expect them to do too much. We need to train him too. Yes. I see that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 Oh, so first we have to lure her and do it down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=234.1s	234.1	 I'm gonna actually let her have a bit of a treat here because she's on the right track
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=237.8s	237.8	 And i'm gonna release a little bit as we go here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=242.2s	242.2	 And right there that's a really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 Roll over nice work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 So the point when you're training dogs going slowly really is the key
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 The question is when do you say the word roll over? I'd say after several occasions like right about now, so it would be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=259.4s	259.4	 Roll over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=260.7s	260.7	 We'll say it simultaneously with the behavior for a few days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=263.9s	263.9	 You know what I mean? Because trying to teach your dog language really quick can be tough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=267.8s	267.8	 But it's more important that you just kind of get them going through the motions with a lure than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=271.9s	271.9	 Than it is that you introduce the word
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=276.8s	276.8	 There should be a primary trainer and that primary trainer should in turn encourage others to follow the same general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 game plan the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=284.1s	284.1	 Primary lessons need to happen with you as the parents first and then you then need to teach, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=289.1s	289.1	 The kids the question is what's to be expected with this type of breed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 Which is a boston terrier i'm different than my peers in this area on not putting too much emphasis on breed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=300.6s	300.6	 because it's I mean it's almost like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=302.9s	302.9	 You know, uh, how quick do chinese people learn?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=305.5s	305.5	 You know, it's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=308.2s	308.2	 It's the same kind of question to me while they have certainly been selected for certain things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=312.7s	312.7	 It's a case by case basis. So I mean at their core
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=316.2s	316.2	 They're still mammals they learn in basically the same way if the outcome to a behavior is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=320.6s	320.6	 Favorable to them. They're more likely to repeat that behavior and if it's not they're less likely to repeat that behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=325.5s	325.5	 Energy level is really the bigger indicator and she's got a lot of it. And which way is energy an indicator good or bad?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=331.6s	331.6	 Oh, I don't I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=333.1s	333.1	 There's pros and cons to all of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=334.5s	334.5	 So I like to rate dogs on a scale of one to three energy level one being total couch potato really lazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=340.2s	340.2	 And then three being constantly high energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=343.2s	343.2	 Um, I like high energy dogs the downside to a high energy dog for a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=348.9s	348.9	 Is that they have to spend a lot of time with a dog because that's not you can't passively teach a high energy dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=355.0s	355.0	 Lower energy dogs require less time, but they do less impressive things typically from a training perspective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=360.9s	360.9	 You know, she's probably in the 2.2 to 2.6 range somewhere. I don't know her that well yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 Are she getting into things is she having potty accidents in the living room when you're in the house with her?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=370.6s	370.6	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=373.8s	373.8	 Whenever like we go somewhere when we leave her home alone she will um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=378.7s	378.7	 She loves going to the bathroom in my sister's room because her door does not work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=383.7s	383.7	 Well, it's always open so she scratches up the door and she goes in there. That's where most of the accidents happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=390.2s	390.2	 Yes, most of okay that makes sense. That makes sense. So see dogs don't generalize a whole house as their home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=397.2s	397.2	 Necessarily when they when they're getting potty trained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=399.5s	399.5	 So it's important that you slowly introduce parts of the house to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=403.4s	403.4	 She should not have free run of the house and our accidents happening in the living room in the kitchen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=407.8s	407.8	 Not really. It's just good. Well, then, you know, and is she getting away with chewing anything up in those areas?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=413.0s	413.0	 Oh, yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=413.4s	413.4	 There's really two main levels when it comes to dog training number one prevent bad habits from happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=418.6s	418.6	 And the way to do that easiest the main way is to have them on a leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=422.6s	422.6	 You understand that now when you can't you can't always have them on leash and you can't always focus on them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=427.9s	427.9	 We have to sleep. That's why things like crates or you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=432.0s	432.0	 Exercise pens are good to have placed in the house or even a puppy-proof bathroom or bedroom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=437.1s	437.1	 Or something like that. So because that's so that puts bad behaviors to a stop now. It doesn't train them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=442.8s	442.8	 But when they're on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=444.0s	444.0	 You're in a much better position to acknowledge behaviors you like and to prevent behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=448.6s	448.6	 You don't like she can't chew up that couch when she's right here on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=452.2s	452.2	 Ideally you exercise her thoroughly before leaving her alone. So she's less likely to have anxiety exercise reduces virtually all anxiety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=463.1s	463.1	 No, no playing is a big part of it, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=466.0s	466.0	 The first year that that's and I see you fighting the freedom issue. That's what I mean too much freedom too early
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=472.4s	472.4	 One year of training and then they can be free for the next 15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=476.0s	476.0	 But that one year just as with kids you you know, you have cribs you have ways to keep them contained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=481.7s	481.7	 Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=481.9s	481.9	 There does need to be a higher level of control and structure that first year and that does come with losing a lot of freedom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=488.9s	488.9	 You're right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=489.8s	489.8	 And and I know you got a dog you want to give her the best life possible let her have as much fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 Let the kids play with her. This is all great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=496.2s	496.2	 But you'll find that if she gets lots of exercise and lots of training that she's going to be mentally content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=501.0s	501.0	 She's going to be like, I love you, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=505.3s	505.3	 Number one control the environment have her on leash. There's no excuse for her to get out of the front door if she's on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=510.8s	510.8	 Uh, you can't because she's still a puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=513.8s	513.8	 So holding a puppy to such a high standard of hey, don't go outside when you want to go is not totally reasonable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=520.7s	520.7	 But i'll show you what to do such a production
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=526.5s	526.5	 Chasing around the neighborhood, but she thinks it's fun. Number one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=530.1s	530.1	 Number one what you're doing wrong in this case if i'm if i'm being honest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=533.6s	533.6	 You're waiting until an organic situation emerges in this case. I got other things on my mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=538.3s	538.3	 You need to stay let me try and get you and force you to stay right now. Okay kids get in, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=542.8s	542.8	 You've got to set up training sessions where you are focused 100% on your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=548.2s	548.2	 100 they can't learn when your attention is divided dogs don't learn to with a distracted trainer. First of all, have you taught her a stay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=555.8s	555.8	 So, I mean before you can expect her to stay with a massive distraction like the outdoors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=559.6s	559.6	 She's got to be able to stay for five seconds. Stay. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=563.4s	563.4	 Again microscopic treats stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=566.1s	566.1	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=567.9s	567.9	 Stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=572.6s	572.6	 I'm providing a good consequence to the behavior the behavior. She's not moving when I hold my hand up like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=578.6s	578.6	 That equals a reward now watch i'm going to push her to failure for example stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=584.9s	584.9	 Stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=586.1s	586.1	 Actually, i'm going to reward that because that was really good, but hold on stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=589.7s	589.7	 Okay, right there. She got up. There's a consequence to that behavior. You know what it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=594.5s	594.5	 No treats, that's it. There are three types of stays stay for duration stay while you walk away and stay while distracted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=601.9s	601.9	 All three of those need to be good before we even get to that door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=605.3s	605.3	 So let me give you an example stay while I walk away the way we measure distance with stay is the distance between our eyes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=612.2s	612.2	 stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=613.8s	613.8	 Stay dogs are less likely to listen to you the farther away you are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=619.2s	619.2	 Stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=624.6s	624.6	 Stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=628.1s	628.1	 Very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=630.2s	630.2	 Now i'm going to go vertical stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=633.9s	633.9	 Notice how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=635.4s	635.4	 You see how the tiny steps i'm taking this is what's not intuitive to training dogs for everyday people who don't do this for living
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=641.5s	641.5	 You know, uh, we take steps that are way too big and expect our dog to kind of make the leap and put it together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=647.6s	647.6	 Sit and it's natural to do that sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=653.8s	653.8	 We need to train him too, no, okay fine stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=659.3s	659.3	 That was great and see stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=666.0s	666.0	 And i'm being very liberal with my rewards here as well you see that stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=671.4s	671.4	 That was helpful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=672.6s	672.6	 Yes, okay. Come on. It's okay. You can get up now. Come on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=676.2s	676.2	 I'm teaching her to get up with permission. It's fine. Let me have a distraction, please. Let me have that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=681.2s	681.2	 Thank you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=682.3s	682.3	 sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=683.4s	683.4	 stay

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=689.0s	689.0	 Subtle stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=694.0s	694.0	 Stay the lower it gets the tougher it is for her stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=698.0s	698.0	 Here look at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=699.4s	699.4	 Yes, very good love eye contact teaching your dog to leave something alone and look at you as key
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=705.3s	705.3	 Up here good. Well, that was a good one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=707.5s	707.5	 stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=708.8s	708.8	 Up here. Yes, see how i'm immediately redirecting that attention to me when she looks at the thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=713.8s	713.8	 That could be outside that could be a cat that could be something she wants to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=717.7s	717.7	 Investigate but we're trying to override her basic impulses. This is called impulse control training stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=724.6s	724.6	 Up look at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=726.6s	726.6	 And stay up here that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=733.0s	733.0	 Use him as a real life distraction sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=736.2s	736.2	 Look at me. Go ahead act crazy do what you do

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=756.8s	756.8	 You're very smart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=768.0s	768.0	 Because if she'll stay when he's doing that she'll stay for just about anything now taking it to the door stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=777.0s	777.0	 Stay

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=786.6s	786.6	 Look at me, please stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=789.1s	789.1	 Just like just like with a kid. You know what I mean? It's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=792.1s	792.1	 You I don't you can't be going out that door. That'll get you killed stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=798.0s	798.0	 Look at me good really nice stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=806.6s	806.6	 Uh-uh, look at me, please
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=809.5s	809.5	 Good she got up from her sit. I'm still gonna reward because she used some restraint. Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=814.3s	814.3	 So it's picking your battles there you cut it's you know, it's not totally mathematical you gotta kind of pick and choose like was it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=820.7s	820.7	 She still stayed, you know, she didn't run out stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=824.9s	824.9	 Stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=828.2s	828.2	 Nope
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=830.2s	830.2	 And see right there I went too far I moved too quickly she started to run out the door, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=834.6s	834.6	 So that's on me to not make that mistake twice in a row stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=841.3s	841.3	 Yes, you're doing great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=843.8s	843.8	 Anytime she is in this lesson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=846.3s	846.3	 I mean that you can see she's picking it up very quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=848.6s	848.6	 But you got to repeat this dozens of times in different contexts while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=852.3s	852.3	 Once you feel like you're getting a handle on this in these dedicated training sessions only then are you ready to start enforcing it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfviADpl6fE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=404&pp=iAQB&t=858.9s	858.9	 When things are more chaotic, you know, so there's three types of training sessions
