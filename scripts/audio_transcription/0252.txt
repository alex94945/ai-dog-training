https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today I'm going to show you four easy, specific ways to train your dog seconds at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=6.2s	6.2	 I'm Zach George. I train dogs. This is my new dog and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=12.5s	12.5	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly. You can start from the beginning or you can pick up anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 Subscribe and hit the bell notification so you never miss an episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=21.4s	21.4	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect, your results will forever remain in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=27.1s	27.1	 This is Inertia. Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=33.5s	33.5	 Okay, I've got to admit before we get into today's lesson, there is one very important prerequisite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=39.1s	39.1	 And that is that your dog has an understanding of their very basic skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 If you need any help with this or you just need a refresher, check out my free digital dog training course, 30 Day Perfect Pup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 And it will show you how to teach your dog all of the most important foundational skills they need to know in just 30 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 The 30 Day Perfect Pup program is actually based on the syllabus that I used to do when I taught real dog training classes, like in person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 And it's actually a lot better because you'll get daily emails with training advice and video lessons from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=67.9s	67.9	 Also, you get a downloadable guide with extra training tips, schedules and lists to help keep you on track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=73.7s	73.7	 And one of the coolest things is you get exclusive access to a private Facebook community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 There's even an app so that you can have everything you need in your pocket at all times to reference on the go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=83.9s	83.9	 It's all totally free. I swear I'll have a link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=87.8s	87.8	 Assuming your dog understands the very basic concept of come when called, sit, stay, believe it and some other basic things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 you're ready to start training them in seconds at a time to listen to you when it really matters and in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=102.9s	102.9	 So when you think about a typical dog training lesson, you might think about sitting down with your dog and working on something brand new with them or working on something they already know, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 Maybe you'll do that for 20 minutes at a time or so. I mean, think back to when you got your first puppy or your first dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 You had to very deliberately sit down with them and walk them through just about everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=123.3s	123.3	 When and where to do their business, what's OK to chew on and what's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=127.1s	127.1	 The basic concepts of life saving skills like come and stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=130.9s	130.9	 And if you're like most people, it took pretty deliberate effort over the span of many weeks to just get basic versions of those things from your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 But at some point, you really have to evolve your training mentality from this is my dedicated training time and start putting a much stronger emphasis on tiny spontaneous training sessions throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Now, don't get me wrong, longer, dedicated training sessions definitely have their place and they're a completely necessary part of training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 But as your dog demonstrates that they really are getting these basic versions, you have to move on to more spontaneous training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=164.3s	164.3	 For instance, once you've really done a thorough introduction and shown your dog all of the parts of a basic skill like staying at an open doorway,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 find times during the day while your dog is preoccupied with something, randomly open the front door and ask them to stay on super short notice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=179.3s	179.3	 Each instance of training like this can be significantly more profound than practice you would do in a more obviously set up training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 Because instead of being in a focused school state of mind, your dog is in their regular day to day mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=193.2s	193.2	 Because inertia has mastered a basic stay, now she's at the point where sometimes throughout the day when she's not expecting it at all,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 I might open a door and throw something really exciting out so that she learns to be really good about staying on very short notice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 Right now, I've got an impromptu lesson planned for inertia. I want to be able to open the front door and the back door both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=214.1s	214.1	 I've never done this training exercise where I've had her stay with wide open doors over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=219.2s	219.2	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=225.7s	225.7	 Back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=229.2s	229.2	 We even had someone walk by over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=233.7s	233.7	 So this is brand new for inertia, being able to leave the front door open like this while I have her stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 But that's what we've worked up to over the last several months on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=242.3s	242.3	 Safety is always the number one priority, so you wouldn't want to practice this until you've worked up to a reliable stay at the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=250.2s	250.2	 So my goal is to make sure that no matter how exciting it is out there that she does not run out of the front door. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=266.6s	266.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 Okay, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=276.7s	276.7	 Good job. Let go. So watch this. I'm gonna get her really into it right here at this door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=283.3s	283.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=297.8s	297.8	 Okay, get it. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=300.0s	300.0	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 Lie down. Very good. Okay, go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=312.5s	312.5	 So in this example, you're practicing more than just the literal skill of staying at an open door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=318.0s	318.0	 You're also teaching your dog to perform that skill when they're in a very surprised state of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=323.6s	323.6	 That's the real value here. After all, that's when we want our dogs to listen to something as important as stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=329.8s	329.8	 The most. There are so many different ways to work on basic impulse control exercises minutes at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=336.1s	336.1	 I cover way more in my books than we'll have time for in this episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 So if you want to check them out, I'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=341.0s	341.0	 Here's another example. A real life leave it. When you very first train your dog to leave it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=346.1s	346.1	 you know, you sit down with them for a few minutes and you hold a treat in your hand and teach them to leave it alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=351.1s	351.1	 in a very focused way. And that type of training lesson is a completely necessary step, but it's a completely different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=358.1s	358.1	 context than leaving something alone in a more real world circumstance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=362.5s	362.5	 But when you're making lunch or dinner, initiate realistic short surprise tests for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=367.8s	367.8	 If you're trying to train your dog how to stay off the counter and stop eating things when you drop them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=372.2s	372.2	 take four seconds to simulate a training session that closely mimics real life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=377.0s	377.0	 I've designed a brand new exercise for inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=379.6s	379.6	 She's never seen this one before so she doesn't know what to expect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=382.6s	382.6	 But you know, say you're at your refrigerator, right? And you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=386.8s	386.8	 spontaneously surprise your dog and make sure that they understand a broad generalized leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=393.5s	393.5	 Let's see. We've got a piece of meat here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=398.2s	398.2	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=400.7s	400.7	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 That was some leftover steak I had for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 inertia. Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=406.7s	406.7	 Of course, you're going to need to phase in these pop quizzes with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=410.2s	410.2	 You still want to make sure that you're prepared to intervene if you're teaching them a new concept or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=414.9s	414.9	 if this whole idea of spontaneous training sessions like this is new to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=419.3s	419.3	 I'm not even having to say leave it. What about some Taco Bell sauce?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=425.5s	425.5	 You can probably tell we don't cook too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=430.2s	430.2	 But I was at the grocery store the other day and they were selling this whole bag of real life lobster claws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=438.6s	438.6	 And I was like, I've got to get that. I only had to tell her leave it the one time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=442.5s	442.5	 Hey, I'm still paying attention to you. Maybe I'll remind her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=446.8s	446.8	 Leave it alone, please. If your dog is more advanced though, up the ante by asking them to leave it alone and also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=453.2s	453.2	 spontaneously come to you from across the room. Inertia, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=458.8s	458.8	 That's so funny. She's like just being extra safe. Good girl. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=466.0s	466.0	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=467.9s	467.9	 Is that funny?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=470.5s	470.5	 Nice job. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=472.6s	472.6	 Here you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=474.0s	474.0	 Good. That was so good. I'm very proud of you. And sometimes you step on the Taco Bell sauce and you still want your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=480.8s	480.8	 to leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=482.3s	482.3	 Inertia, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=484.4s	484.4	 Good girl. Oh look, I was even able to get her to go through this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=488.6s	488.6	 Nice job. It's okay. Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=490.8s	490.8	 This way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=492.6s	492.6	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=496.2s	496.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=497.7s	497.7	 Basic impulse control exercises like this are going to come in very handy throughout your dog's life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=503.3s	503.3	 because think about how often your dog is suddenly presented with something that they want to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=508.5s	508.5	 but they're not allowed to. I remember one time training Inertia and I accidentally dropped an entire bag of treats and this worked really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=515.8s	515.8	 That's one of the many reasons we emphasize leave it so much. There are accidents that happen in their surroundings all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=522.5s	522.5	 And this is a pretty harmless one if she were to get the treats but could be something more dangerous in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=527.2s	527.2	 Let's cover another completely different example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=529.4s	529.4	 All right, let's say that when you get home your dog is so excited to see you and they jump all over you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=533.8s	533.8	 because you've been away for a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=535.2s	535.2	 If this is something that you'd like to stop simply ignoring your dog for the first five minutes or so is a great way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=540.6s	540.6	 to discourage this type of behavior. And at the end of five minutes give them all the love in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=545.4s	545.4	 If you do this over a couple of weeks or maybe more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=547.8s	547.8	 you'll probably notice that your dog actually gives you a chance to get your groceries inside the house without totally flipping out and jumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=554.6s	554.6	 all over the place. Come when called is another one of my very favorite things to practice with Inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=559.9s	559.9	 a few seconds at a time throughout the day. You can see right now she's just walking around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=565.4s	565.4	 She sees mom with a camera over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=568.2s	568.2	 And so I might just say Inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=571.4s	571.4	 come. And like before by teaching your dog to come to you while you and your dog are not in a rehearsed state of mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=578.1s	578.1	 you're teaching them how to come to you on short notice. Think about it. When do you want your dog to come to you the most?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=584.2s	584.2	 It's not when they're completely focused on you in a dedicated training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=587.8s	587.8	 but when their mind is wandering and they're focused on something completely different than you. A dog is truly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=593.8s	593.8	 trained in these small moments and it's the little things that you do that are ultimately going to determine how well your dog listens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=600.6s	600.6	 Throughout the day ask yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=602.0s	602.0	 what can you do for the next 30 seconds with your dog to establish or further your communication together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1wOyldMoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=253&pp=iAQB&t=607.5s	607.5	 Short spontaneous training sessions like this are the key to cementing your dog's training in the real world.
