https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 and how it affects dogs and us with our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=23.8s	23.8	 How have you guys been affected by coronavirus so far?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 I mean, are you self-isolating?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=27.9s	27.9	 Are you going about business as usual?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 Bree and I and the dogs are practicing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=32.6s	32.6	 mostly self-isolating right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=34.9s	34.9	 I mean, we'll go outside and to the park
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=37.3s	37.3	 and places like that, which the experts seem to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=39.9s	39.9	 is pretty much safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=41.5s	41.5	 But we're not going in crowds, of course,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=43.2s	43.2	 and we're trying to be really smart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 about those that we go around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 I'm actually here in Atlanta right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=48.9s	48.9	 As you'll find out in an upcoming video,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 this is a second house that we purchased here in Atlanta,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 but we've even been refraining from visiting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 with family while here until we get more information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 and understand these variables a little bit more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 Because the concerning thing to us right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 is that the variables aren't very well known.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=67.3s	67.3	 And to us, it kind of seems like a classic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=70.1s	70.1	 better safe than sorry scenario.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=72.4s	72.4	 And that's the approach we're taking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=74.9s	74.9	 But how are you guys dealing with it?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 because we're all in this together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=78.8s	78.8	 and we're just trying to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=80.1s	80.1	 how to make all this work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=81.3s	81.3	 As you'll understand, one of the most important things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 when raising a new dog, especially a young dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 is adequate socialization with the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=88.9s	88.9	 Now, I never anticipated we'd be in a scenario like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 which can make it much more challenging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 to get out there and socialize your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=96.8s	96.8	 and give them experience with the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=98.8s	98.8	 when we're told to stay home or stay away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=101.4s	101.4	 from large gatherings and things like that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=105.8s	105.8	 that we can go over and that's kind of some of the things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 that I wanted to talk about today.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 especially really young dogs,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=133.7s	133.7	 Before we get into tips on that though,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=155.3s	155.3	 that these dogs can transmit the virus to humans.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=230.7s	230.7	 let them experience as much as they can

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 to be close to strangers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=250.2s	250.2	 Say you go to a dog park, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=251.8s	251.8	 to give your dog some social time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=253.5s	253.5	 But dog to dog interactions seem pretty safe right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=256.2s	256.2	 at least relative to this virus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=258.6s	258.6	 There may be other reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=259.9s	259.9	 that you don't want your dog interacting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=261.5s	261.5	 with other dogs though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 So really the big question is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=264.1s	264.1	 how do we keep our dogs occupied
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=265.9s	265.9	 while we're social distancing right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 Whether you're self-isolating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=269.1s	269.1	 or it's mandatory in your area right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=271.9s	271.9	 this is a great excuse to spend a lot of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=274.3s	274.3	 with our dogs training them stuff, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=276.2s	276.2	 It's also a great way to keep you occupied
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=278.6s	278.6	 and keep you from going crazy too, hopefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=281.7s	281.7	 I mean, naturally, daily walks and leash practice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=284.4s	284.4	 which can be particularly challenging with many dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=287.2s	287.2	 is something that you can give a lot of priority to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=289.7s	289.7	 right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=290.6s	290.6	 For example, when you're teaching your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=291.6s	291.6	 to walk on leash, it's no secret
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 that you've got to be very patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=294.6s	294.6	 You really have to adopt this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 I've got all day attitude.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=298.1s	298.1	 And fortunately, right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=299.3s	299.3	 many of us actually do have all day.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 at the park or in your backyard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=305.3s	305.3	 or even indoors if you must.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=313.3s	313.3	 because it's always keeping your dog engaged

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAG9_hTHFE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=291&pp=iAQB&t=318.7s	318.7	 when they're teaching their dog a trick.
