https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Where is the best place to start off-leash training if you don't have a fenced yard or if it's not private?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 I like to seek out janky fenced baseball fields, personally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=11.5s	11.5	 Places where it's not too well kept because you're probably gonna get kicked out of those places in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 It depends where you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=17.3s	17.3	 Like, if you're in the more rural areas, they're far more tolerant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 But I like public sports fields.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=21.6s	21.6	 I would very strongly suggest finding a fenced environment and using a 20-foot lead simultaneously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 At least a 20 or a 30 or a 50.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 That double redundancy is really going to keep mistakes from happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=36.2s	36.2	 In fact, sometimes in semi-fenced areas, when you get to a certain point in your training, and I demonstrated this in my videos,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 I will work against a single fence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 So if I know everything in front of me is blocked off and I can kind of read the dog pretty well and look into their eyes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 like, are they thinking about darting right or left?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 Then I can be one step ahead of them, get their attention on me quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuokot_jZ8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=56.2s	56.2	 Again, this is providing you've gotten to a certain point in your dog training.
