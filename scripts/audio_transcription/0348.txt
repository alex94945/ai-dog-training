https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=2.1s	2.1	 Dogs grow up really fast, and over the first year of their life, they change so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 That can be really challenging to keep up with.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 Rochers already discovered the curly bully stick here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 Obviously, Pup Box understands that four-month-old dogs are going through the chewing phase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=28.8s	28.8	 Whoa, what's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=30.1s	30.1	 It's a light-up ball. It squeaks too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 It does all of the things to stay interesting to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=34.7s	34.7	 Oh, look at this. A fun puzzle toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=37.1s	37.1	 That's really good for mental stimulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=39.6s	39.6	 Look how that engages his mind there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 He's really trying to get those cookies out of the milk carton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 Puppy teething rings. Essential for young dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 These are really durable, so they last a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 Some salmon treats too. These will come in handy in our lesson.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=80.4s	80.4	 to get your training started off right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 Now, if you're committed to learning how to train your dog without using outdated forceful methods,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 you're going to need to understand lore training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 And by the way, this is covered in Pup Box's training guide too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=91.4s	91.4	 So when you get your four-month-old box, you'll have a nice refresher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 So let's take some of our treats here and let's get started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 With lore training, you really want to keep that treat nice and close to their nose and their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=101.8s	101.8	 And look, see how his head goes that way or that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 This now puts me in a position to really lure him into a specific physical position here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 We're going to try and go into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=111.7s	111.7	 Yes, sit. That's very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=114.1s	114.1	 Notice how I use the word yes to mark the behavior that I like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 Now, let's see if we can get him to go into a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 Yes, down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 So I'm telling him yes, and I'm also telling him the word of the action he's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=129.3s	129.3	 And as you can see, I'm moving that treat very slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=132.1s	132.1	 I emphasize that because most beginner trainers tend to lure way too fast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=136.6s	136.6	 which causes a disconnect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 And now I'm going to see if I can lure him back into an up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=140.8s	140.8	 Real slow. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 And you might notice that's still one treat, by the way, that I've been using.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=145.9s	145.9	 I've just been releasing tiny bits of that treat this whole time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 So, you know, I'm letting him lick on it right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=150.8s	150.8	 Really keep him interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 So you don't need to use big treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 In fact, you should be using very small treats of a really high value reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=158.3s	158.3	 So in this case, I'm using salmon treats from my pup box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 Once your dog is really following the lure, now if we say sit, you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 So I didn't have to lure him quite as much there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 That's very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 And for down, rather than focusing on the lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 Yes, down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 Did you see how that was kind of like a hybrid lure and a hand signal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 That's kind of what you have to do in the beginning to phase out that lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 So you don't have to hold the treat at their mouth every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 So we're gradually turning that lure into a hand signal over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=186.4s	186.4	 Now, this can take several days of training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=188.6s	188.6	 but that's a rough draft of what it should start to look like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 Lure training is not only good for things like sit and lie down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=194.5s	194.5	 but you can teach some fun tricks, which are great for mental stimulation there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 Look at that. Roll over and a roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=202.5s	202.5	 That was cute. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=204.2s	204.2	 And these are more than just teaching your dog cute tricks and behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=207.2s	207.2	 By teaching your dog things like this, you'll be able to ask for alternative behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 when they're doing something you don't like, like jumping on you, barking or running away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=214.7s	214.7	 When a dog is going through the teething stage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=216.6s	216.6	 it's not just about giving them alternative things to chew,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=219.3s	219.3	 but it's also about showing them the proper way to use their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 Since dogs don't have hands, this is how they explore the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=225.3s	225.3	 So getting them to use their mouth in different ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=227.6s	227.6	 and chew at different levels of force is very important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=230.6s	230.6	 So it's okay to bite hard on this bully stick, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 and it's okay to bite vigorously when you're playing tug of war with a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=236.3s	236.3	 But when it comes to my arms and my hands, you can't bite those hard at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=240.2s	240.2	 So when your dog starts to nip at you and bite you as four-month-old dogs inevitably will do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=245.1s	245.1	 it's important to redirect their attention off of you and onto something that's acceptable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=249.1s	249.1	 So they learn, oh, I can't bite you hard, but I can bite this hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=252.3s	252.3	 All right, so we've covered some basic training and how to manage his teething,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=256.1s	256.1	 but I think we should go out back and practice his leash training and come when called.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 Those are essential skills for all puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 Rochaud isn't the best on leash right now, but look, he's still very young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 You can understand that, but he's lunging and pulling and he's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=269.4s	269.4	 I want to see this. I want to see that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=271.4s	271.4	 So good leash skills are essential when you're training a dog like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=275.5s	275.5	 Leash walking isn't a very natural skill for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=277.8s	277.8	 I mean, dogs like this walk faster than we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 So teaching them to walk slow like us people is going to take some time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=283.8s	283.8	 But I think Rochaud is perfectly primed to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=286.1s	286.1	 And by the way, if your dog is jumping on you or pumping you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=288.7s	288.7	 like Rochaud continues to do, you just need to very consistently redirect them into a sit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=293.9s	293.9	 have them hold that sit for just a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=295.8s	295.8	 That's why it's important to teach your dog things like sit and lie down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=299.2s	299.2	 because that's incompatible with jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 It's tempting here to just push your dog off of you and get them to stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=304.5s	304.5	 But if you can get them to think by luring them away like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 your training is going to be much more effective because they had to originate the idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=312.2s	312.2	 to follow that treat to stop jumping on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 This is what I like to call inside out training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=317.4s	317.4	 Some people might think, oh, look, you're rewarding him for humping, but I'm not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 I'm using that treat to get his attention off of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 And over here into a sit on to leash walking, sir.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 The main thing is you want your dog to just pay attention to you while you're moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=330.2s	330.2	 That's all we're trying to accomplish in these early stages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=332.7s	332.7	 Take short steps over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=334.2s	334.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=334.7s	334.7	 Did you see how I just instantly rewarded right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=337.7s	337.7	 I don't want him to get in the habit of pulling and then me having to say, no, don't do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=341.5s	341.5	 In other words, we want to catch him succeeding over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=343.8s	343.8	 Look at that turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 You're so sophisticated, aren't you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 Don't be stingy with rewards with early training either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=350.1s	350.1	 Be very generous because if you got their attention, you want to keep it that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=354.4s	354.4	 As your dog becomes more reliable, though, the less treats you'll need to use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=357.8s	357.8	 So eventually you won't need to use treats at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=359.7s	359.7	 So if you're having trouble getting your dog to pay attention to you on leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=362.9s	362.9	 there's no shame in lowering them in short distances, just like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=366.6s	366.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=367.4s	367.4	 And over here and look at that attention over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=370.5s	370.5	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=370.8s	370.8	 See, always looking up at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=372.9s	372.9	 The moment we start venturing off into a new part of the path,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=376.3s	376.3	 that's technically a new environment and likely to be very distracting for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 Now his attention faded off with me a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=382.1s	382.1	 Now I've lost him completely and now I've got him back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=384.5s	384.5	 So let me go ahead and reward that attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=386.3s	386.3	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=387.2s	387.2	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=387.6s	387.6	 I'm going to turn around now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=388.8s	388.8	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=389.4s	389.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=390.1s	390.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=391.4s	391.4	 I'm telling him yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=392.5s	392.5	 Every time he does something I like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=394.2s	394.2	 This is what an introductory leash walking session looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=396.9s	396.9	 But of course, it's important to practice in a variety of different environments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=400.7s	400.7	 and practices very often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=402.4s	402.4	 This is what we call a training walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=403.8s	403.8	 In other words, I have no destination in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=405.8s	405.8	 I'm simply trying to teach the mechanics of this is how you walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=408.5s	408.5	 When you're on a leash in this type of environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=410.8s	410.8	 you'll need to set up training walks outside of your normal recreational walks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=415.0s	415.0	 for maximum success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=416.3s	416.3	 Now, if your dog tends to be the type who's super energetic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=419.5s	419.5	 exercising them thoroughly before leash walking session like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=422.6s	422.6	 is likely to make things a lot easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=424.7s	424.7	 We've done quite a bit today so far, but we're not done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=427.2s	427.2	 Come when called is a vital skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=429.1s	429.1	 All dogs need to know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=430.4s	430.4	 When you're teaching your dog how to come to you when you call them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=432.9s	432.9	 you want to simulate an off leash environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=434.9s	434.9	 The best way to do that is with a really long 20, 30 foot lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=437.9s	437.9	 Don't try to teach your dog and bypass controlling the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=441.4s	441.4	 There's way too much room for error.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=443.3s	443.3	 See, he sees a bird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=444.2s	444.2	 I'm actually going to let him drift off a little bit here and explore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=446.9s	446.9	 There's no harm in a dog exploring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=448.6s	448.6	 In fact, it's really important for puppies to be able to explore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=451.2s	451.2	 When you're teaching your dog to come to you when you call them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=453.0s	453.0	 you want to be worth coming to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=454.6s	454.6	 Sometimes that means being energetic with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=457.3s	457.3	 Other times, that means giving them a great incentive to come to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=460.2s	460.2	 like using a really good treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=461.9s	461.9	 Or you might even want to encourage them to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=464.0s	464.0	 You want your dog to look forward to coming to you, not dreading it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=466.9s	466.9	 So avoid scolding them at all costs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=469.0s	469.0	 So let's give it a shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=469.9s	469.9	 We have some good distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=471.2s	471.2	 Come here, come here, come here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=477.8s	477.8	 I'm going to give him an extra big reward there because coming to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=481.6s	481.6	 I mean, you don't want to take any chances on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=483.8s	483.8	 This is a potentially life saving skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=486.1s	486.1	 By the way, I want to point out he's doing all this in an outdoor environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=489.5s	489.5	 That's always nice when they do that this young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=491.4s	491.4	 And part of the reason we're able to get success in this distracting outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=494.6s	494.6	 environment is because we've given him many minutes to adjust out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=497.9s	497.9	 Right now, look, he's starting to drift away again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=500.2s	500.2	 Let's try a different method this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=501.6s	501.6	 Let me see if I can get him to chase me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=503.1s	503.1	 This can be really effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=505.1s	505.1	 Rocio, hey, come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=507.4s	507.4	 Come on, yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=510.7s	510.7	 And if you've ever tried to chase down a puppy or a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=513.4s	513.4	 you know they like to run from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=514.6s	514.6	 But the secret is dogs don't really care who's doing the chasing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fjknf77DA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=518.2s	518.2	 as long as they're playing in the game.
