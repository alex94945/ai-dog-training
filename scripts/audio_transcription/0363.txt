https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=2.0s	2.0	 Has this ever happened to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=3.7s	3.7	 Indy, are you hungry?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 Oh, let's eat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=7.4s	7.4	 We're out of dog food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=8.7s	8.7	 Let's see what this is really costing me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 Okay, time to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=12.5s	12.5	 I'll be right back, Indy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=13.8s	13.8	 Sorry I can't spend this time with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=17.4s	17.4	 Boy, this is what life must have been like in the 20th century.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=22.7s	22.7	 I'd rather be watching YouTube for sure right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=30.7s	30.7	 There are definite better uses of one's time than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 But actually, I didn't need to get dog food at all because I'm a Pet Flow customer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=38.3s	38.3	 Go to the link I have in the description, choose the brand of food you want,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 And Pet Flow will practically pay you to try this service out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 You'll get $10 off your first three automatic shipments when you enter code ZACH30.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=51.9s	51.9	 And with all that time I save, I like to shoot dog training videos for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=56.2s	56.2	 Click thumbs up for Finn, the 11-week-old puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=58.8s	58.8	 Is he not the cutest puppy you've ever seen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=60.7s	60.7	 If you have a new dog, subscribe to my channel right now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=68.5s	68.5	 Tag at Zach George and upload a picture of your dog with hashtag dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 I'll share some of my favorites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 Grab a copy of my book, Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 I'll have a link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=77.7s	77.7	 We've got an action-packed lesson planned for Finn today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 We're gonna go over leash walking, how to teach your dog to listen around distractions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=83.7s	83.7	 maybe even do a trick or two, and how to play tug and fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 This is gonna be fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=87.8s	87.8	 One of the first things I like to assess with dogs is of course their desire to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=91.6s	91.6	 Clearly Finn is really into playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 Just look at his energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 Not all puppies are like this though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=96.2s	96.2	 Some are more chill and more relaxed, which means you would take a different approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=99.5s	99.5	 But in his case, since he does have so much energy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 I'd like to bring some structure to this play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=104.4s	104.4	 Tug of war and let go is a really good way to start introducing structure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 Right now I'm not picky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=109.6s	109.6	 I'm not insisting that Finn let go of the toy or anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 I just want him really into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 When a dog this young has this much energy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 it's really important that they have that structure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=118.7s	118.7	 And teaching a dog fetch is the path of least resistance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=121.7s	121.7	 when it comes to getting their energy out conveniently on your schedule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=125.1s	125.1	 so that you don't have to walk them for an hour or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=127.5s	127.5	 Now you might think that your dog knows fetch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 but I actually have a really specific definition for fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=132.7s	132.7	 Fetch is where you throw a toy, your dog picks it up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 enthusiastically returns it in a straight line to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 and promptly lets go eagerly awaiting the next throw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=142.1s	142.1	 So as you can see, Finn does a great job of chasing the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=144.7s	144.7	 Sometimes he brings it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 Sometimes he doesn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=146.7s	146.7	 Right there, he did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 That's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=148.2s	148.2	 And because he brought it back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=149.4s	149.4	 I'm not just going to insist that he let go of it immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=151.8s	151.8	 I'm going to give him a real vigorous reward to let him know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=154.3s	154.3	 I love that you brought it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 The reward is the game of tug of war here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=157.4s	157.4	 which he's clearly having a good time with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=159.1s	159.1	 Now let me see if I can get him to let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 I'm just going to make the toy boring and just wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 And this is normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=164.5s	164.5	 They can go on for a second or two, but when he lets go,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=166.7s	166.7	 I'm going to give him a prompt yes and immediately toss the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 just a few inches or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=173.3s	173.3	 Yes! Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 As he starts to run away, I'm right there to grab the leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 so he's not running all over the place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=178.3s	178.3	 That's a really common issue when you're teaching fetch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 for your dog to just run all over the place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=182.7s	182.7	 It's essential to have your dog on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=184.5s	184.5	 so that you can prevent bad habits from getting started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=187.1s	187.1	 Do you see right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 He's getting bored with the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 He's not picking it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=189.9s	189.9	 What I'm going to try to do is make that toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 a little bit more interesting so that he picks it up on his own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=197.1s	197.1	 By bringing movement, rapidly shaking a toy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=199.4s	199.4	 you're likely to trigger a dog's interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=201.2s	201.2	 Just moving it around, getting them to chase it here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=203.3s	203.3	 And you see how we've reignited that game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 where he started to get bored?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=206.1s	206.1	 That's how you overcome it, just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 But it's important to do short reps when you're teaching fetch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=210.5s	210.5	 not throw it across the yard just yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=212.2s	212.2	 because you're trying to get the mechanics of chasing the toy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=214.5s	214.5	 picking it up, and bringing it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=216.1s	216.1	 Good. And let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 Good. Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=219.7s	219.7	 Good. You see how active we're keeping this game?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=222.6s	222.6	 Good job. Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=224.5s	224.5	 So I'd say you're well on your way to being a professional fetcher, Finn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=227.7s	227.7	 You're awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=228.6s	228.6	 In Finn's case, he has an issue with puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 So really teaching him the proper way to play is essential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=234.4s	234.4	 And this is how you do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 Because if you do this for a few minutes every day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=237.7s	237.7	 up to an hour as they get older, then he'll be satisfied
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 and won't have that desire to play with anyone and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=243.4s	243.4	 Playing with your dog really encourages them to listen to you for the long run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 It's a great way to build a relationship and connection with a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=250.1s	250.1	 Finn's doing really good on his training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 but I'm curious to see how a young puppy like this does in an outdoor environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 Let's see what else he knows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 Let's go out back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=257.8s	257.8	 Of course, it's much more challenging to get your dog's attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=260.9s	260.9	 In an environment like this, the main thing I want to check for here is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=263.7s	263.7	 first of all, will he take a treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 The answer to that is yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=266.4s	266.4	 He'll take a treat in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=267.8s	267.8	 Some dogs are so distracted, they won't even take real meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=270.6s	270.6	 But in his case, he's receptive to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=272.4s	272.4	 That means we're ready to go on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=273.7s	273.7	 So let me see if I can get a basic sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=275.4s	275.4	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=276.3s	276.3	 Very good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=277.1s	277.1	 Let me see if we can get him into a lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=281.2s	281.2	 Yes. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=282.3s	282.3	 I mean, this is a new texture right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=284.2s	284.2	 This isn't like carpeting or a hard floor that you might come across inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 Yes. Oh, he's even offering his paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=289.7s	289.7	 Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=290.5s	290.5	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=291.1s	291.1	 Hey, let's see if we can get him shaking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=292.5s	292.5	 I'm just going to hold the treat here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 I'm going to wait for him to paw at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 Yes. Shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=296.3s	296.3	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=297.2s	297.2	 Right there, he just lifted his paw up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 Very good. Shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=300.3s	300.3	 And there he really lifted it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=302.0s	302.0	 That's excellent, Finn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=303.4s	303.4	 And while I didn't really plan on teaching him shake, he's offering it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=306.2s	306.2	 So why not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=306.9s	306.9	 No time like the present.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=308.4s	308.4	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=309.8s	309.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 And every time he does it, I'm releasing tiny bits of turkey right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 When you're training outside, you don't want to use second rate treats either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 You want to use something your dog really loves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=319.4s	319.4	 Today, I'm using real meat, turkey, very small pieces of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=322.6s	322.6	 You already have enough you're competing with, so having a strong currency is important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=326.8s	326.8	 Now let's see if we can kind of fade out the treat a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 You can see that paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=330.1s	330.1	 It's thinking about coming up right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=331.6s	331.6	 You see it shaking?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=332.5s	332.5	 Yes. That's called shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=334.3s	334.3	 I'd say he's really getting shake down, wouldn't you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=336.6s	336.6	 That looks like a nice, pretty two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=338.1s	338.1	 If you can get your dog doing something new that they haven't really done well before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 and you can get them doing it outside, they're in good shape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=344.7s	344.7	 But of course, if your dog isn't doing this well in an environment like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=348.6s	348.6	 don't stress it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=349.4s	349.4	 Just take a step back, try practicing it inside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=351.9s	351.9	 and really perfect it there before taking it outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=354.6s	354.6	 Training your dog is really a balance of training them in lots of different places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=358.2s	358.2	 What is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=359.2s	359.2	 Oh, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=362.5s	362.5	 So right there, a bike went by, and he was very interested in it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=366.3s	366.3	 and I was able to get his attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=368.3s	368.3	 Hey, look, we've got more bikes coming up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=370.9s	370.9	 So let's see if we can get him to listen to us in the presence of these bikes riding by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=374.4s	374.4	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 Yes, there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=377.0s	377.0	 See, if your dog never has these experiences,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=379.5s	379.5	 they're not going to know how to react when they encounter things like bikes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=382.4s	382.4	 The point I'm trying to make here is it's really important to get out and train outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 as often as you can, because you're going to come across things that your dog's never seen before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=391.7s	391.7	 and your dog has no way of knowing how to behave until they get the experience of behaving around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=396.4s	396.4	 things that they haven't seen before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 Every dog really needs to understand how to walk on a leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=401.0s	401.0	 and Finn is really at that age where leash walking is pretty unnatural to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=404.6s	404.6	 Let's do a puppy leash walking session and see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=407.1s	407.1	 So let's see how Finn walks on a leash right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=409.4s	409.4	 Finn is obviously interested in the jogger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=411.8s	411.8	 That's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=412.3s	412.3	 Hey, Finn, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=413.8s	413.8	 Hey, really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=414.7s	414.7	 He offered his attention right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=416.2s	416.2	 Let's see how Finn does when we just walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=418.3s	418.3	 And you can see he's kind of all over the place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=420.2s	420.2	 He's smelling the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=421.9s	421.9	 Let's see what happens when we walk this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=423.9s	423.9	 You know, you probably want a little more structure to your walk than this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=427.4s	427.4	 So let's see if we can make an improvement on that right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=429.8s	429.8	 Let's get him warmed up with a basic sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=433.1s	433.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=433.8s	433.8	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=434.6s	434.6	 And remember, since he's so small, there's a lot of distance between our eyes right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=438.7s	438.7	 So let me make sure we can get a good look at me from up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=441.1s	441.1	 Finn, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=443.1s	443.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=444.3s	444.3	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=445.1s	445.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=445.5s	445.5	 I'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=446.5s	446.5	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=446.9s	446.9	 Come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=503.8s	503.8	 to such a high standard of walking perfectly on leash.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g-tQkDW_dc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=364&pp=iAQB&t=529.7s	529.7	 And let's see if we can get a few successes in a row here without having to reward him.
