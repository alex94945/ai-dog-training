https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 We just started making our way from New Orleans, Louisiana,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=3.2s	3.2	 to hopefully Alaska with our totally untrained puppy, Veronica,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 and our seasoned rock star, Inertia, in a tiny RV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=11.6s	11.6	 How long is this trip supposed to take?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 I have no idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 Alaska is very far from Louisiana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=16.1s	16.1	 I heard it was just north of Seattle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=17.6s	17.6	 It is not just north of Seattle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 We made it to the beautiful town of Henrietta, Texas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=23.4s	23.4	 So I get like a zillion dog training questions every week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=25.9s	25.9	 as to what my best tips are for training a new puppy or any dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=29.5s	29.5	 One thing I always tell people, especially those who are new to training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=32.1s	32.1	 is be really consistent and practice often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=35.4s	35.4	 And I get it, sometimes that's easier said than done,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=37.5s	37.5	 as we've seen many times on our series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 But wouldn't it be great if you had all the toys, the treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=44.4s	44.4	 the supplies and the advice, probably the most important part for an entire year?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 Putbox sends you supplies and detailed advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 as to what to work on with your dog, very specific to their age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 For example, this is the two month box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=58.7s	58.7	 You're not just getting toys and treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=59.9s	59.9	 you're getting really useful tools like this training leash here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=62.7s	62.7	 When your puppy is two months old, you need to manage their environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 And they talk about that on this training card.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=69.2s	69.2	 And then they give you the leash to do it with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=71.6s	71.6	 I think it's so great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 I want to see if these treats are really optimized for training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 That's not one treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=76.6s	76.6	 That's a bunch of treats, because look, I can just break them off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 They have different textures for your teething puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 You can put some treats right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=84.3s	84.3	 So it's a little tougher to access.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=86.1s	86.1	 Listen to the crinkles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=88.1s	88.1	 Different than, you know, a plush toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=90.9s	90.9	 These guys have like ballistic bug skin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=92.9s	92.9	 They are very untueable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=94.5s	94.5	 Ballistic bug skin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=96.2s	96.2	 It looks like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=97.8s	97.8	 And it's ballistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 I'm telling you, try to rip that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=101.8s	101.8	 Pretend you're a puppy, try to bite it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 Ah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 You can get half off your first PupBox when you sign up for a three, six
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=107.6s	107.6	 or 12 month plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=108.4s	108.4	 Go to pupbox.com slash Zach and enter discount code Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 Here's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 In Henrietta, Texas, apparently it is supposed to be over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=115.3s	115.3	 100 degrees for the next many days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=118.1s	118.1	 Oh, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 I don't know that I want to spend a ton of time here for that reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 And when you know you're dealing with hot weather, getting out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=126.2s	126.2	 just before sunrise is pretty smart idea, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=128.7s	128.7	 I think we're both really looking forward to getting out of this extreme heat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 and into some weather where we don't need any climate control at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=137.1s	137.1	 Good thing we're headed north.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=138.7s	138.7	 Yeah, I'm sure you're not going to overcorrect there at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=142.1s	142.1	 What do you mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=146.3s	146.3	 But right now, I've got to be honest, I feel like I have found my favorite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=149.5s	149.5	 place on earth here in Henrietta, Texas, because I am feet away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=154.5s	154.5	 from the perfect ball field to play Frisbee with inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 I'm telling you, those rough ball fields out in the country
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 are the best place to train and play with your dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=164.7s	164.7	 You can hear like kids in the background playing, which is also good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 You're going to see a lot more updates with inertia because people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=170.3s	170.3	 keep asking for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 But she's been doing incredible with her Frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=173.2s	173.2	 I feel like she's really just coming into her own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=176.1s	176.1	 And she's been so great with Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=178.3s	178.3	 I'm the most proud I've ever been of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=180.2s	180.2	 She's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 I think one of the challenges when you have two dogs, one that you've had a while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=184.2s	184.2	 like we have had with inertia and then a younger dog like Veronica,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 that the temptation is to be like, I need to put all of my effort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 into the new dog to make sure I get them up to speed as soon as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 But of course, you can't neglect your other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=195.9s	195.9	 So kind of what I've been doing, I'm still working with inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 and maintaining her training, but I'm sure to exercise her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=201.1s	201.1	 early in the day before I do a major training session with Veronica
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=204.1s	204.1	 so I can satisfy her mentally, physically, and just get her to take a nap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=207.5s	207.5	 while I focus one on one with Veronica, who needs that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=210.4s	210.4	 Before we move on here from Texas, though, I've got a couple of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 I really want to work on with Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=215.5s	215.5	 Yes, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=216.8s	216.8	 She needs it. Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=218.5s	218.5	 Come when called is such a critical skill, maybe one of the most important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=222.8s	222.8	 of all time. And Veronica's recall needs some work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 And that's to be expected with a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=226.9s	226.9	 I really think come when called is done successfully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=229.8s	229.8	 when you focus on it and little bits at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=232.4s	232.4	 You're not going to train your dog to come to you in one training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Furthermore, even if you do get some successes of come when called,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=237.9s	237.9	 context is everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=239.5s	239.5	 Like right now, she's looking at the random debris on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=242.2s	242.2	 There's a stick over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=243.7s	243.7	 So we always want to be conscious of the setting and the things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=246.6s	246.6	 that are going on around us when we're asking our dogs to come to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 In other words, it's really common for dogs to be too overwhelmed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=252.8s	252.8	 by their environment to process the request to come to you when you call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=256.2s	256.2	 Sometimes your dog is going to want to get into ants and say, hey, what's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=259.4s	259.4	 And on one hand, the most severe wildlife we've encountered so far is fire ants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=263.4s	263.4	 I don't like those guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=264.6s	264.6	 But I hear as we go north, there might be some larger animals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=267.8s	267.8	 that we have to deal with in the wild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=269.7s	269.7	 Oh, we got some geese in the background she's barking at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 And right now, I'd be satisfied to get her to just glance at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=275.5s	275.5	 because she's very stimulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=277.2s	277.2	 All right. Well, we're off to a start here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=281.4s	281.4	 Veronica. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=283.6s	283.6	 I was hoping that once I had her attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=285.5s	285.5	 she would just automatically come running to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=287.4s	287.4	 I mean, she does that in less distracting instances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 So going to give her the treat because I said yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=292.6s	292.6	 Come on. She started to come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=294.5s	294.5	 But I think it's probably best to let this play out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=297.4s	297.4	 and give her the opportunity to reason through what I'm asking rather than saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 come, come, Veronica, Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 Yes. All things considered, though, that was pretty amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=308.2s	308.2	 because she was really distracted when inertia was that age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=311.9s	311.9	 She would not have come to me if she was barking and really excited like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 Yeah, I think you maybe haven't spent the night with Veronica in a little while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=319.4s	319.4	 because she's more reactive than inertia once the sun goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=322.8s	322.8	 Typically, after successes like this, I like to let her go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=325.7s	325.7	 to doing what she was doing, even if she wants to go over there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=328.3s	328.3	 and bark at all those geese.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 I'm actually OK with that right now because I know that must be very interesting to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=334.6s	334.6	 And she has to satisfy that curiosity at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=337.4s	337.4	 Now is as good a time as any, I suppose. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=341.7s	341.7	 Veronica, she's showing glimmers of responding to her name,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=344.6s	344.6	 which in this case is really just an attention getter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=346.9s	346.9	 And I want to be there to encourage her to come to me when she does look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=351.6s	351.6	 Come. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=354.0s	354.0	 So you see what I did there out of habit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=355.6s	355.6	 I said, come. And I gave her a hand signal simultaneously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=358.4s	358.4	 I really would like to isolate those. Yes, that was so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=362.1s	362.1	 And I also said it as she was coming to me. Not before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=364.9s	364.9	 Right now, I'm really focused on telling her what she's doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=368.3s	368.3	 rather than telling her to do something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=370.0s	370.0	 You'll know that keeping control of your dog, especially in public,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=373.2s	373.2	 is the number one priority for their own safety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=376.2s	376.2	 I'm using a long lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 Typically, I like to use a 20 to 30 foot lead for lessons like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=380.6s	380.6	 This not only keeps our dogs from getting away from us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 but it also keeps them from getting into things that they shouldn't. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=387.4s	387.4	 And she's like, how can I get something I want?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=389.2s	389.2	 Well, coming to that guy often works just by having your dog on a lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=393.7s	393.7	 You can literally prevent them from getting into bad habits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=397.6s	397.6	 And I mean, getting your dog to chase you and follow you is a great way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=400.8s	400.8	 to encourage them to voluntarily come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=403.0s	403.0	 With puppies, they tend to stay with you naturally a lot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=405.7s	405.7	 especially young puppies like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 But she's coming up on that age where her curiosity is very likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=411.1s	411.1	 to get the best of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=412.2s	412.2	 And she's not as likely to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=414.6s	414.6	 So overwhelming consistency, particularly with come when called is important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=418.4s	418.4	 And what do I mean by that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=419.5s	419.5	 Make sure you've got treats and or toys everywhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=422.1s	422.1	 and always have access to those things as much as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=424.7s	424.7	 Do not leave the house without a currency with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=427.4s	427.4	 You want to be in a position to reinforce the recall when they come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=431.0s	431.0	 Now, sometimes you can use the environment itself as the reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=434.2s	434.2	 In other words, access to the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=435.9s	435.9	 Other times, having a really high quality treat or having a great toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=439.7s	439.7	 that they love can help them establish the habit of coming to you when you call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=443.8s	443.8	 This is one of those things that's way easier said than done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=446.3s	446.3	 Always having a currency, that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=447.8s	447.8	 But if you commit to getting good at that, you won't regret it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=451.2s	451.2	 What Zach has taught me with Veronica, bare minimum,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=453.9s	453.9	 is that I at least always want to have one treat in my pocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=457.1s	457.1	 So when I wake up now, I brush my teeth and I put a treat in my pocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=460.7s	460.7	 I got one treat in my pocket and the other one is in my pocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=466.6s	466.6	 You need so many treats in your pocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=468.3s	468.3	 I think it's important for dogs to know the difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=470.4s	470.4	 between hand signals and verbal requests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=473.3s	473.3	 There will be many times in a dog's life where one will have an advantage over the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=477.1s	477.1	 Maybe you're engaged in a conversation with a neighbor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=479.3s	479.3	 and you just want to give a hand signal to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=481.2s	481.2	 Or maybe you have your hands full and you want to give a verbal request.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=484.7s	484.7	 Let's get one with my hands behind my back here. Just the word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=488.6s	488.6	 Come. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=491.1s	491.1	 OK, it seems like she's starting to get the hang of coming to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=494.2s	494.2	 when I use my voice to actually call her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=496.9s	496.9	 But I also want her to understand my hand signal, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=500.0s	500.0	 So I'm going to try to give her a super obvious hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=503.2s	503.2	 Over time, I can make this more subtle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=507.8s	507.8	 So that kissy sound that I'm making really gets her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=510.8s	510.8	 Once I have her attention, she's likely to come running to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=513.8s	513.8	 since I've been consistently rewarding her in this session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=517.0s	517.0	 Good. And notice, too, I'm not insisting when she comes to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=520.2s	520.2	 that she hold a sit, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=521.5s	521.5	 I'm letting her go back to doing what she wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=523.6s	523.6	 because I don't want her to dread coming to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=526.0s	526.0	 Our goal continues to be to do our best to virtually always guarantee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=530.0s	530.0	 that there's something great waiting for Veronica when she comes to me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=534.3s	534.3	 especially when I ask for it and even when I don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=537.6s	537.6	 Yes, reluctantly. But she did a good girl. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=542.5s	542.5	 So rather than saying come this time, I'm only going to use a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=546.2s	546.2	 Yes. Great. This is really strong evidence that Veronica is starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=550.3s	550.3	 to understand the two different languages, a hand signal and verbal language independently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=555.0s	555.0	 A big mistake when you're teaching come when called, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=557.7s	557.7	 is to just burn it into their brain over and over too much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=561.0s	561.0	 because then you're taking the fun out of being outside and letting them experience life.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=568.3s	568.3	 Small bits every day is better than one single word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=571.5s	571.5	 Better than one big bit once a week, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=574.5s	574.5	 Now that Veronica has had some exercise, she's had mental stimulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=578.5s	578.5	 There's something I've really been wanting you to coach me on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=580.5s	580.5	 because I cannot afford to mess this one up. It's her bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=583.9s	583.9	 Oh, yes. She's so dirty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=586.8s	586.8	 She hasn't had a bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=588.1s	588.1	 She's not that dirty. It's kind of hard to get her dirty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=590.4s	590.4	 I know. Maybe it's one of her breeds or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=592.5s	592.5	 Have you guys guessed her breed mix yet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=594.0s	594.0	 Because I've got to know your guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=595.3s	595.3	 Please tell me because her DNA results will be here any minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=598.0s	598.0	 And I want to know your guesses first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=599.7s	599.7	 This is a first for me. It's kind of amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=601.6s	601.6	 I've never given a dog a bath in an RV sink before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=604.9s	604.9	 Oh, yeah, I know. I love that she's sink sized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=607.4s	607.4	 It's a perk. I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=608.8s	608.8	 And by the way, notice how good and invisible and Ursa is being.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=612.6s	612.6	 She's perfect in the bath. It's not her favorite activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=615.2s	615.2	 She's just like, I hope they don't think about me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=617.0s	617.0	 because they sure are saying that four letter word a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=619.0s	619.0	 Yep. She's like, I'm fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=620.8s	620.8	 I'm just taking a nap back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=623.4s	623.4	 You can just not notice me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=625.0s	625.0	 I've got a great treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=626.2s	626.2	 Hopefully that's going to help her learn to love the bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=628.6s	628.6	 Right at her mouth that she set her down by putting it right at her mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=631.9s	631.9	 You're going to let her nibble on it so you can kind of make it last.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=634.8s	634.8	 Really briefly, can we talk about mindset when you're giving a dog a bath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=639.0s	639.0	 especially one who's either inexperienced with the bath or has never had a bath?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=642.6s	642.6	 Yes, please. Our mindset really needs to be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=645.6s	645.6	 And we need to a lot a lot of extra time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=648.0s	648.0	 The worst thing to do with bath training is to go fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=652.6s	652.6	 The more comfortable we can make our dogs when getting a bath, the better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=655.6s	655.6	 But Veronica is looking extremely stable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=658.5s	658.5	 You're getting really good at just letting her kind of lick that treat and enjoy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=662.1s	662.1	 There's a lot of value in that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=663.1s	663.1	 You can really make it last because the fear with a dog like hers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=665.8s	665.8	 we treat her too much because it doesn't take much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=667.9s	667.9	 She's tiny. If you can get her looking at you like here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=670.4s	670.4	 Yes. You know, try and get that going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=672.5s	672.5	 Veronica. Here. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=676.0s	676.0	 The tricky part here is like letting her see that trickle without catching her off guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=680.4s	680.4	 That was a great reaction. How you turned it on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=682.6s	682.6	 Only criticism I might offer constructively is not to have it on that long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=686.9s	686.9	 Like just in case. Don't give her a chance to panic over it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=689.6s	689.6	 So then, yeah. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=691.6s	691.6	 Good. And she did fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=693.3s	693.3	 You didn't do any harm there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=694.5s	694.5	 It's just with some dogs, if they have that past association,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=697.2s	697.2	 I don't know if she does with having a rushed bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=701.6s	701.6	 Good girl. Yeah, I'd say leave that on if she wants to drink it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=704.2s	704.2	 That's great. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=706.4s	706.4	 Yes. Well done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=709.8s	709.8	 So you see how we're going slow here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=711.0s	711.0	 She's fine when the water comes on and even when it runs for a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=714.7s	714.7	 And she's willingly paying attention to Brie looking up at her saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=717.7s	717.7	 hey, can I have another treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=718.7s	718.7	 And Brie's answers. Absolutely. You can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=721.6s	721.6	 All right. What now? Go ahead and like wet your hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=724.8s	724.8	 and then touch her with it, but let her see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=726.8s	726.8	 So like, don't catch her off guard. That's warm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=730.2s	730.2	 OK. Yeah. Always check the temperature. Good point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=732.7s	732.7	 See, my hand is wet. Look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=737.0s	737.0	 That was good. That was a little sneaky, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=739.6s	739.6	 I don't know that I would do that. Oh, OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=741.9s	741.9	 Brie seems to be missing my message here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=744.5s	744.5	 I don't just want Veronica to see Brie putting her hand under the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=748.5s	748.5	 I'd like Veronica to see the entire motion of Bree's hand getting wet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=752.8s	752.8	 then moving over to her so that Veronica doesn't get caught off guard like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=757.4s	757.4	 Just let her see what's going on, because she reacted great, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=761.8s	761.8	 See, that's water. Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=763.3s	763.3	 I mean, there's more than one way to do something, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=765.4s	765.4	 And see right there. That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=766.9s	766.9	 She noticed it, but there's a lick lip there could potentially be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=772.2s	772.2	 a little nerve wracking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=773.2s	773.2	 That's fine, right? That's great. That's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=775.4s	775.4	 I mean, interacting with the water freely is amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=778.2s	778.2	 She doesn't like it on your ear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=779.3s	779.3	 So maybe I won't wash her head this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=781.4s	781.4	 No, no, don't get out. Wait here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=783.4s	783.4	 OK, so here's an important moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=785.6s	785.6	 Let's go ahead and get this away from her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=787.0s	787.0	 How about a look at me? Can you get a look at me? Look at me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=790.4s	790.4	 Yes. I'm just like fumbling a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=792.9s	792.9	 It's a little, you know, it's a lot of things to handle at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=795.2s	795.2	 Yes. Welcome to the world of training. I fumble all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=798.9s	798.9	 I'd much rather have a generally good experience for her right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=803.1s	803.1	 Than a thoroughbath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=805.0s	805.0	 So I did just reach back there and kind of sneakily get soap on my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=808.7s	808.7	 Am I cool to put the soap on her? Yeah. OK, good, because I'm going to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=812.8s	812.8	 I love how she pretends to ask me permission to do things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=815.5s	815.5	 Well, no, I actually don't want to mess up this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=819.8s	819.8	 No, Veronica, you're all soapy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=824.2s	824.2	 Come on. Come back. Come back. Come back. Come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=828.1s	828.1	 Can I get in here if you want the treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=830.6s	830.6	 Treats only happen in the sink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=832.8s	832.8	 Yeah, that's a good way of looking at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=835.3s	835.3	 Can you recover?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=836.6s	836.6	 It's the moment I put soap on her, too. Of course. Interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=839.6s	839.6	 I can't no turning back now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=841.2s	841.2	 I've got to fix this because she's all soapy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=844.7s	844.7	 All right. Veronica is getting a little wild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=846.8s	846.8	 Good thing our other dog is very well behaved and trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=852.2s	852.2	 I knew it would happen eventually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=853.8s	853.8	 Everything is falling apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=856.6s	856.6	 Good girl. Can we be quiet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=858.6s	858.6	 Can you lie down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=860.6s	860.6	 Thank you. That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=862.4s	862.4	 So we're trying to get her back into the sink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=864.4s	864.4	 Looks like we're going to have to assist her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=866.9s	866.9	 And look, she's still taking treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=868.6s	868.6	 So I keep mentioning that, right? Because why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=871.3s	871.3	 Why is it important that she's taking treats?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=872.9s	872.9	 Why is that relevant?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=873.8s	873.8	 If she's not taking treats is a sign that she's too stressed, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=876.4s	876.4	 Potentially. Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=877.9s	877.9	 Very often, especially when coupled with the context of getting a bath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=881.5s	881.5	 not taking treats where they otherwise would is a good indicator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=884.2s	884.2	 that they are stressed out and not likely to be the most cooperative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=888.3s	888.3	 And so that's a sign to us that we need to adjust our strategy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=892.1s	892.1	 make things a little more low key, adjust our expectations, slow down, all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=896.3s	896.3	 I see why people rush baths, because I'm like, let's freaking go here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=899.4s	899.4	 Well, yeah, as they become accustomed to getting a bath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=901.5s	901.5	 you ought to be able to run through one in five or 10 minutes with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=903.9s	903.9	 It shouldn't take that long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=904.8s	904.8	 With that first bath, I mean, allow for 30, 40 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=907.8s	907.8	 And notice how we have it on a trickle, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=909.7s	909.7	 If it was a full on spray, she might be a little more nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=912.8s	912.8	 Getting the butt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=913.6s	913.6	 That's the most important part when you're doing a first bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=916.0s	916.0	 Yes. Stay in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=918.0s	918.0	 Here you go. And then stop with the water. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=920.0s	920.0	 And now just go ahead and, you know, with your hands, rinser only.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=924.9s	924.9	 There you go. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=928.3s	928.3	 Got her. Try not to get your bed wet, but I got me wet instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=931.4s	931.4	 It happens. Hey. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=933.4s	933.4	 Good. Ready? Done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=937.0s	937.0	 Yes. See, I just wanted to stop with me actually rinsing her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=940.4s	940.4	 and then turning it off instead of her jumping out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=942.6s	942.6	 That was what I was trying to do there quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=946.7s	946.7	 All right. Good. Cool. Not a bad first bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=949.6s	949.6	 So I give myself a what a D?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=952.4s	952.4	 No, I give you an A plus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=954.4s	954.4	 I mean, maybe a C.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=956.1s	956.1	 I feel like I did a C plus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=957.6s	957.6	 Well, she mostly stuck with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=959.2s	959.2	 And I like how you stopped when you saw like, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=962.0s	962.0	 you found a good stopping point when she was rinsed well enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=965.0s	965.0	 You didn't wash her head the first time, which I think was a smart move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=968.0s	968.0	 So we're making our way through Texas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=969.5s	969.5	 It's time to move on, though, and hopefully we can make it to Kansas tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=973.7s	973.7	 That's far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=977.1s	977.1	 Zach went to get some supplies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=979.7s	979.7	 What? Interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=982.8s	982.8	 Cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=985.9s	985.9	 Thanks. Got my M&Ms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=988.0s	988.0	 Yes. Yay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=989.9s	989.9	 Thank you. Both kinds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=992.1s	992.1	 Sweet. Thanks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=997.9s	997.9	 We're actually staying at what looks like a totally abandoned fairgrounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1002.6s	1002.6	 Brie, I don't know what you guys are doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1004.0s	1004.0	 I'm going to sneak in around to Frisbee with inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1006.6s	1006.6	 I can't wait to show you guys how this place looks when we have some daylight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1009.7s	1009.7	 But first, we'll have to make it through the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1012.6s	1012.6	 Inertia. What are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1015.2s	1015.2	 Just because we live in a trailer now does not mean we are going to start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1019.6s	1019.6	 counter surfing. Pretty good day of traveling today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1022.4s	1022.4	 The dogs did excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1024.2s	1024.2	 Hopefully we'll have a good night's sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1026.5s	1026.5	 Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1029.0s	1029.0	 One thing I've noticed as we've been traveling these few short days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1032.6s	1032.6	 is that every place we stop at has a different view,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1035.6s	1035.6	 which is throwing both of the dogs off of Veronica is really thrown off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1039.9s	1039.9	 What the heck is happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1041.9s	1041.9	 Dogs seem to be adjusting pretty well considering when they play with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1045.4s	1045.4	 They're enjoying seeing new places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1047.5s	1047.5	 Inertia is loving playing Frisbee in new places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1050.0s	1050.0	 And Veronica is just enjoying being Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1053.1s	1053.1	 She's a hot mess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1054.4s	1054.4	 One of the games they like to play is seeing if they can fit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1058.2s	1058.2	 the other dog's entire head in their mouth.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1063.6s	1063.6	 True, she does have an advantage, but Veronica is not letting that stop her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1069.1s	1069.1	 Veronica tries to open her mouth, big enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1071.3s	1071.3	 There's no way I have a great feeling about this place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1075.1s	1075.1	 I can't wait to get a peaceful night's sleep in our RV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1079.6s	1079.6	 What's going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1080.7s	1080.7	 She's barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1081.8s	1081.8	 Anytime Veronica hears anything, she barks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1085.0s	1085.0	 I'm starting to think that this RV trip was a secret plan to get Bre to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1088.9s	1088.9	 on Veronica's barking habit more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1091.1s	1091.1	 Maybe, maybe not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1094.0s	1094.0	 Sometimes it feels good to bark, doesn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1096.2s	1096.2	 I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1096.9s	1096.9	 Relax, it's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1098.0s	1098.0	 Fortunately, the work we have been putting in with Veronica
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1101.2s	1101.2	 is barely starting to pay off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1103.8s	1103.8	 I mean, yeah, it's understandable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9mLCdmZ_Js&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=1105.1s	1105.1	 We have the windows open here.
