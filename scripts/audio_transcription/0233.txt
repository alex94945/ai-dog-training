https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 See, this kind of barking right here is not the I have to go potty kind of barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 Today's episode is all about potty training your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=11.4s	11.4	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=12.4s	12.4	 I'm a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=13.4s	13.4	 Meet my new project, Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 I've got just three weeks to train her and set her up for the most well-behaved life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=18.8s	18.8	 possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 That means I need to work on the most common puppy issues like potty training, how to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 pay attention, stopping things like play biting, chewing, separation anxiety, getting along
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 with other animals, leash walking and teaching her everything a good dog needs to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=33.5s	33.5	 Real dog training doesn't always go smoothly and that's why I'm going to show you every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=37.1s	37.1	 success and mistake and how I work through all the most challenging parts of raising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=41.6s	41.6	 a new puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 Welcome to your new puppy survival guide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=47.7s	47.7	 Today's potty training video is unlike any potty training video we've ever done because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 we're in the thick of it right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=53.9s	53.9	 She's been the biggest challenge I've had on potty training in years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=58.3s	58.3	 Potty training with Kona started off really well, but then it started to get out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=63.2s	63.2	 I'm talking about multiple potty accidents inside the house during the day and that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=68.2s	68.2	 not a good sign here, especially if you're a professional dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=72.1s	72.1	 So we're putting things back in the gear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 Now potty training this puppy is my main mission in life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 And I'm telling you guys, never underestimate a dog trainer who's determined to potty train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 I'm pulling out all of the stops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 I'm going to cover everything that's working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 I'm going to focus on what's not working and I'm going to show you how we troubleshoot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=90.3s	90.3	 potty training relapses like we're having with Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 I mean, how many of you deal with that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 You know, you have a couple of days of success with your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 You start getting a little confident, maybe a little cocky about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=100.9s	100.9	 And then before you know it, your dog is having potty accidents everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 That's exactly what has happened to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=106.6s	106.6	 I admit it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=107.6s	107.6	 I'm not perfect, but what I will say is that we're going to fix it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=111.5s	111.5	 One more thing that I hope to add to our potty training regimen today is teaching her how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=115.6s	115.6	 to ring a bell in order to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=117.7s	117.7	 And I'll explain why that can be beneficial and why you can't totally rely on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 All right, let's review everything we've done so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=124.7s	124.7	 Honestly, the bottom line to potty training a dog is controlling their environment where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=128.4s	128.4	 they can and can't go and letting them outside often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=131.6s	131.6	 Naturally, that is much easier said than done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=134.2s	134.2	 I mean, what do you do if you live in a multi-dog household and the dogs are playing together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=137.7s	137.7	 You don't always want to have them put up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=139.3s	139.3	 Now, you might remember a few lessons ago, I updated you on potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=142.9s	142.9	 And part of the reason that I think we've had some setbacks on house training is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 I've been prioritizing socializing her with my dog Inertia in particular, giving her tons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 of playtime with Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=153.8s	153.8	 The two main times that I'm experiencing accidents are when I give her social time with Inertia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=159.3s	159.3	 which is so important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=160.3s	160.3	 I mean, a 13 week old dog like Kona needs those social skills and to interact with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=164.7s	164.7	 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=165.7s	165.7	 So to me, that was like the most important thing of all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 And of course, sometimes when we're filming these videos, ironically enough, we'll get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 focused on filming for 45 minutes at a time, maybe an hour and a half in some occasions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 And I forget to take her out and she has an accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 So it's all completely my fault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 I want to be clear about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=183.9s	183.9	 And that's true with you guys too, if your dog is having an accident, we have to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=187.3s	187.3	 accountability and understand it's our responsibility to show our dogs where they can and can't do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=192.1s	192.1	 their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=193.1s	193.1	 So I believe we've identified the main issues here and we've buttoned those up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=197.1s	197.1	 So now when I'm going to let her play with Inertia and have playtime in the house, I've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=201.3s	201.3	 been tethering her out on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=202.9s	202.9	 It's been working out really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=204.4s	204.4	 It also allows Inertia to retreat and get some space from the hyper puppy sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 But this also gives Kona plenty of room to kind of walk around and still experience some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=215.4s	215.4	 freedom when I'm not in a position to just completely watch her like a hawk and make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=219.7s	219.7	 sure that she's behaving appropriately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=221.7s	221.7	 It's a great way to supplement controlling the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=224.5s	224.5	 It's one of many ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=225.9s	225.9	 And sometimes you might notice here how she was chewing on the lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=229.5s	229.5	 I don't like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 So what I'll often do is give her something else to chew on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=234.8s	234.8	 After all, she is a teething puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=236.5s	236.5	 So we want to make sure that she has plenty of good chews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=239.1s	239.1	 That's a beef tendon chew right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=241.2s	241.2	 Even though I don't intend for any indoor potty occurrences to happen at all, perfection
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 is obviously impossible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 So just in case I'm getting too carried away on YouTube or Instagram and not paying attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 she's within range to come over here and go potty on these pads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=257.6s	257.6	 I like pad training for a variety of reasons, not just for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 I like them for people who live in apartments where it's difficult to take a dog out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 In the south, we have hurricanes all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=266.4s	266.4	 So it's nice to have an alternative for a dog to relieve themselves indoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=270.6s	270.6	 So don't think that your dog can only learn to go on grass or potty pads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=275.7s	275.7	 They can definitely learn both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=277.3s	277.3	 I've also had the Furbo dog camera set up right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=280.4s	280.4	 Not only has it helped me with potty training, but it's also helped me manage her separation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=284.2s	284.2	 anxiety, which those of you following the series will know has been her number one issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=288.5s	288.5	 actually that I've been focused on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=290.5s	290.5	 So this has been coming in so handy with Kona's training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 The Furbo is a pretty genius product because it doesn't just notify you when your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=297.3s	297.3	 is barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=298.3s	298.3	 It'll notify you if they're howling or making any number of vocalizations or whether or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=302.0s	302.0	 not the barking has been continuous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=303.4s	303.4	 And I can actually check in and see, okay, what kind of barking is this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=307.2s	307.2	 Is this the kind of barking where she's saying, hey, let me out of here right now, even though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=310.2s	310.2	 I don't have to pee or anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=311.9s	311.9	 And also when she is quiet and behaving appropriately, I can actually give her treats from anywhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 in the world.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=321.5s	321.5	 in the same country if you had to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 This is amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=324.4s	324.4	 I'll have a link in the description where you can get your Furbo great product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=328.3s	328.3	 I know you'll love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=330.5s	330.5	 See this kind of barking right here is not the I have to go potty kind of barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 This is the kind of barking that's saying, hey, I want to be let out right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=340.6s	340.6	 Let me out of here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=341.6s	341.6	 And I have to be very delicate about the times that I let her out of the crate because we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=346.6s	346.6	 are dealing with separation anxiety and I don't want her to think that this type of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=351.0s	351.0	 barking works for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=352.6s	352.6	 So I want to wait for her to be quiet for several seconds before I let her out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=358.5s	358.5	 Relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=359.9s	359.9	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=363.2s	363.2	 Relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=368.3s	368.3	 I said yes, I need to provide a positive outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=371.8s	371.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=373.7s	373.7	 That positive outcome is now getting to come out, but only during moments of quiet there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=377.7s	377.7	 but she's actually doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=379.4s	379.4	 That was a rare outburst.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=381.3s	381.3	 Ouch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=382.3s	382.3	 You bite too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 One of the questions I'm often asked is can you teach a dog to ring a bell in order to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=390.1s	390.1	 be let outside?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=391.1s	391.1	 They can at least signal to you, hey, I want to go out there because I got to go pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=395.2s	395.2	 I first want to set the bells down on the ground rather than just putting them up on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=399.1s	399.1	 the door just to get her comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=400.8s	400.8	 It's not out of the realm of possibility that some dogs might get nervous of that sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=405.2s	405.2	 So we want to get her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=406.6s	406.6	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=408.4s	408.4	 Comfortable just by saying, hey, you can investigate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=411.2s	411.2	 I'll give you a treat when you do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=412.7s	412.7	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=413.7s	413.7	 She even touched it right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=415.1s	415.1	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=416.1s	416.1	 Let me see here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=417.1s	417.1	 So far so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=418.1s	418.1	 I'm going to pick them up here, see if we can get her to interact with them in any way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=420.5s	420.5	 See, can you shake?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=421.8s	421.8	 Sometimes she'll use her paw naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=423.8s	423.8	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=426.8s	426.8	 I don't know if we're.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=429.0s	429.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=430.0s	430.0	 I like that she nudged it with her nose there as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=431.9s	431.9	 Just anything we can do to get her to touch those bells.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=434.8s	434.8	 Let me set them back down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=436.8s	436.8	 Let her think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=439.8s	439.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=443.7s	443.7	 Even though it was an accident, I'm still going to go and acknowledge that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=448.1s	448.1	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=452.7s	452.7	 Going to acknowledge it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=453.8s	453.8	 Some of the coolest things that you teach your dog are taught by accident at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=458.1s	458.1	 Get it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=463.1s	463.1	 So I'm really I'm just trying to get her comfortable making contact with the bells and then we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=467.1s	467.1	 can go to the next level here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=473.4s	473.4	 That one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=483.2s	483.2	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=485.2s	485.2	 Now, you might remember we've talked about various ways to reward a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=489.5s	489.5	 We talked about rewarding them with food when they do something great like sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=494.0s	494.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=495.0s	495.0	 We might reward them with a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=496.5s	496.5	 Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=498.1s	498.1	 Just a few seconds can be good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=499.7s	499.7	 But the third type of reward is just access to a desirable environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=504.7s	504.7	 You might realize this, but many dogs, if not most dogs, really love to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=510.0s	510.0	 Kona, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=512.3s	512.3	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=519.6s	519.6	 Maybe even play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=520.6s	520.6	 Maybe I'll just use all three when teaching this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=522.4s	522.4	 See if we can just get her into a groove here of tapping the yes accident, but that's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=529.8s	529.8	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=541.9s	541.9	 the bells, that seems to be getting her comfortable with touching them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=544.4s	544.4	 Come here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=634.2s	634.2	 We shouldn't have to rely on them to let us know when they have to go out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=638.4s	638.4	 Yes!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=642.6s	642.6	 But as I said before, really communicating with your dog and showing them how to communicate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=646.6s	646.6	 with you can only help you in the long run.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=652.6s	652.6	 them to go potty out there instead of inside, it'll be easier for you to notice when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=657.6s	657.6	 asking to go out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=659.1s	659.1	 That's one of the benefits perhaps of teaching your dog how to ring a bell as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=662.6s	662.6	 And since this is obviously a potty training video, I want to give you guys some advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=665.9s	665.9	 on things I've learned about house training a dog over the years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=668.9s	668.9	 Many of them I have learned the hard way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=670.9s	670.9	 It's been my experience over the years that many clients run to the impression that dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=675.9s	675.9	 trained in just a week or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=677.4s	677.4	 But in reality, it does take longer than that, especially if you're talking about a puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=681.4s	681.4	 potty training, probably more than anything else takes tons of consistency, months of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=686.4s	686.4	 relentless consistency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=688.5s	688.5	 Now it's really normal for dogs to start catching on within just a few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=692.2s	692.2	 In fact, you can probably get 80% there in pretty short order if you're consistent, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=696.6s	696.6	 it is that last 20% that can really get out of control if you let your guard down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=701.3s	701.3	 As we've seen with Kona, relapses are probably a lot more common than you realize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=706.2s	706.2	 When your dog does have an accident, we don't want to get mad at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=708.9s	708.9	 We don't want to scold them or punish them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=713.6s	713.6	 How are they supposed to know that it's not okay to go on the tile floor on here, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRpNVHii_E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=717.5s	717.5	 it is okay to go on the grass out here.
