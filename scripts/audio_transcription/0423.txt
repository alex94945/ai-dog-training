https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 And tell PetFlow how often you want it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 Enter code ZAK30 when you check out and you'll get $10 off your first three automatic shipments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 Click thumbs up for Tiberius, the 9-week-old puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 Subscribe to my channel and if you've got a new puppy, pick up a copy of my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=33.9s	33.9	 You won't regret it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 You won't believe how differently dogs take in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=38.2s	38.2	 And better understanding how they perceive the world is going to make you a better trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=42.5s	42.5	 I think he's waking up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=43.6s	43.6	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 This is what he looks like conscious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 Okay, maybe not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Now you've probably heard that dogs see the world in black and white, but that's not exactly true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=52.9s	52.9	 There's two dogs in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 Can you see the colors?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=55.8s	55.8	 Dogs can be tested for color blindness just like people can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=58.7s	58.7	 By being trained to identify objects which are a different color.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=62.3s	62.3	 Can you see the green one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=63.6s	63.6	 And using tests like this, combined with our knowledge of eye anatomy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 we can determine which colors dogs see and which they don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=70.7s	70.7	 You're supposed to tell me if you can see the green.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 You're not supposed to eat the colorblind test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=75.3s	75.3	 Dogs can see blue and yellow and white and gray,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 but red, green, and yellow all basically look the same to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=81.2s	81.2	 Have you ever wondered why dogs get zombie eyes when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=84.2s	84.2	 light shines in their eyes when it's dark or when you take a picture of them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=87.7s	87.7	 Dogs in the wild are crepuscular hunters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 They see best in dim light at dusk and dawn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=92.7s	92.7	 This is aided by their tapetum lucidum, which is what causes the zombie eye effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=97.1s	97.1	 A dog's vision is about three times blurrier than ours,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=99.9s	99.9	 and because of this, dogs are much better at recognizing objects when they're moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 When you're playing with your dog, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=105.3s	105.3	 if you and the toy are more animated during the process,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=108.3s	108.3	 well, your dog is a lot more likely to be enticed by you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=111.1s	111.1	 And it's easier for dogs to make out individual people from farther away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=115.3s	115.3	 when the person is moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 So if, for example, you're trying to get your dog's attention on you from far away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 try moving around a little bit and you're a lot more likely to get them to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=124.6s	124.6	 Sometimes it doesn't work as planned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 If you've ever wondered if your dog can see things on TVs or displays,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 the answer is yes, especially on higher definition televisions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 The way dogs really see the world, though, is with their noses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=137.2s	137.2	 Dogs can detect scent in shockingly small amounts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=140.4s	140.4	 up to a hundred million times less concentrated than we can with our human noses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 Their sense of smell sometimes is so stimulating that it's hard for them to focus on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=149.3s	149.3	 That's why it is so important to get your dog used to all of the smells of the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=153.4s	153.4	 before you can reasonably expect them to listen to you in the presence of those smells.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 Dogs have a much bigger mental and physical capacity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 for analyzing and remembering scents than we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=163.3s	163.3	 Bottom line, their overall physiology allows them to collect higher concentrations of any given scent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 So when your dog is smelling the wind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=169.9s	169.9	 they're actually gathering information about things that are happening farther away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 like maybe a neighbor's dog is approaching, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=175.8s	175.8	 They also have a special organ in their nose that allows them to detect hormones like pheromones
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=180.3s	180.3	 that animals naturally release, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 And this is fascinating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=184.2s	184.2	 Dogs can smell with each nostril independently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 In other words, they smell in stereo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=189.5s	189.5	 That, combined with their wet nose,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=191.1s	191.1	 really allows them to detect which direction a smell is coming from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 Dogs are getting an amazing picture of what goes on in your neighborhood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 when you allow them to sniff around on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=200.1s	200.1	 They can even smell the difference between morning and afternoon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=203.2s	203.2	 I mean, it's like they can tell time with their nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=205.4s	205.4	 So when you're training your dog, embrace their incredible nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=208.6s	208.6	 This is one reason that using lure training and good treats can give you an advantage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 Be sure to let them have extra time to sniff around next time you're on a walk, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=216.4s	216.4	 As you probably guessed, a dog's ability to hear is vastly superior to ours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 In fact, a fully developed dog can hear things up to four times farther away than we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 If your dog has ever gone crazy when you turn on a vacuum,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 it could be because they hear a really high-pitched sound from the motor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=231.3s	231.3	 that our human ears can't detect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=233.3s	233.3	 And dogs' ears can tilt and rotate to really zero in on where a sound is coming from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=238.2s	238.2	 much more efficiently than we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=239.8s	239.8	 Now, as far as taste goes, well, dogs aren't as sensitive to taste as we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=244.1s	244.1	 See, they've only got about 1,700 taste buds compared to our 9,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 How you like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 Finally got something on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=251.1s	251.1	 Interestingly, dogs do have one special taste ability, though,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 that we don't have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=255.9s	255.9	 They have taste buds specifically tuned for water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=259.3s	259.3	 These water taste buds are concentrated on the tip of your dog's tongue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=262.7s	262.7	 which is the part they use to lap up water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=264.8s	264.8	 Doesn't taste like anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=266.2s	266.2	 How can you taste this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=267.3s	267.3	 So dogs can taste sweet, salty, sour, bitter, meat and fat, and it turns out water, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 Dogs may have another very interesting sense,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=278.2s	278.2	 the ability to detect Earth's magnetic fields.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=281.3s	281.3	 Recently, a molecule associated with this ability was found inside the eyes of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 While there's not yet enough definitive evidence to say that dogs can detect magnetic fields,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=291.1s	291.1	 it is the same molecule that's been associated with this ability with other mammals and birds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=295.9s	295.9	 You're not supposed to eat the magnetic field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 You're supposed to see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 Plus, a study suggests that dogs may prefer to orient themselves on a north-south axis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=304.2s	304.2	 when they pee and poop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mJet68AFk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=424&pp=iAQB&t=306.5s	306.5	 Tai, why is that so important to you?
