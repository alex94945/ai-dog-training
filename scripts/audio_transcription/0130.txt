https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgD-TZFRUww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=8.6s	8.6	 Okay. And I release her from the stage. She's doing really good with that. But really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgD-TZFRUww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 that's only one type of state. Traditionally, we dog trainers think of stay in three broad categories,
