https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 Now let's go inside and meet Millie, Joey and Amber Shea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=64.1s	64.1	 Amber Shea, how did you come up with the name Millie?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 Well my brother named my dog Kilo after a rapper and I didn't like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 So I saw Kilo in the metric system and I started naming all my animals after metric units.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=76.2s	76.2	 I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 It's creative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 It's a good science name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=79.2s	79.2	 Do you ever call her Millimeter when she's in trouble or anything?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=80.6s	80.6	 Only when she's good and cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=82.9s	82.9	 How old was Millie when you got her Joey?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 When we found her she was two months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 Okay so two months and how old is she now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 She's two years now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=90.1s	90.1	 And tell me what the issue you have with her is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 Well whenever a new person walks to the house, especially a man, she's more apprehensive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=96.9s	96.9	 and she gets scared to see them go near them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 She barks, her hair raises up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=101.7s	101.7	 I was over here a few days ago and I could see she was really uncomfortable in my presence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=105.7s	105.7	 I mean when I stood up for example, she was really thrown off by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 You could see her tail in between her legs and her ears back as she barked indicating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=113.9s	113.9	 that she just really wasn't comfortable with a new person in her presence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=117.3s	117.3	 But you don't notice the behavior as much with women, is that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=119.6s	119.6	 That's very true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=120.6s	120.6	 This is a super common thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 You know a lot of dogs are more intimidated by the presence of a man versus a woman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 I mean often times they're bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=127.4s	127.4	 Our goal needs to be getting Millie comfortable and creating good associations with strangers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 and people she doesn't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 Millie is upstairs right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 Alright so why don't we bring her down and see how she does and then I'll give you some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 tips from there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 Why do some dogs act like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=140.9s	140.9	 There's a good chance that she may behave this way due to a lack of socialization at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 a young age but it could also be genetic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=147.7s	147.7	 For many dogs maybe they had a bad experience earlier on in their life and this made them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 act that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 A lot of people kind of jump to the conclusion that a dog may have been abused in their past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 if they tend to be reluctant of men or strangers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=160.7s	160.7	 This is not usually the case but sometimes it can be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 I'll be paying particular attention and I hope you guys will too to Millie's body language
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 to kind of try and read her and see how she's interpreting this new variable of me being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 Plus remember we've got our lights set up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 We have Brianna who's filming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=177.4s	177.4	 There are a lot of other variables here that are likely to make Millie uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=182.1s	182.1	 So our goal is to make her as comfortable as we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=184.8s	184.8	 Alright.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=186.8s	186.8	 Yep doesn't want to come in so we have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 What I'm going to do right now is I'm going to get low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 Just to be a little bit more inviting to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=194.2s	194.2	 Do you want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=195.2s	195.2	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=196.2s	196.2	 It's amazing what Turkey will do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 So that's a good sign straight away that she took treats from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=212.3s	212.3	 If a dog is really stressed off and they won't even take treats from you because they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=215.7s	215.7	 nervous of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=216.8s	216.8	 Notice the wagging tail too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=218.4s	218.4	 You see how her tail is wagging?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=220.9s	220.9	 That's more of a nervous tail wagging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=222.7s	222.7	 Kind of waving back and forth rather than wagging vigorously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=226.3s	226.3	 So that means that she's a bit nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=228.5s	228.5	 I'm also not going to force my eyes on her or encourage any strong eye contact with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=234.4s	234.4	 right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 I'm actually going to look away so I appear less threatening to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 You know I'm very big on eye contact but a dog like Millie may be quite nervous if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=242.9s	242.9	 look at her in the eyes and force the eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=246.3s	246.3	 So it's important to be very understanding with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=248.4s	248.4	 Every dog is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 Now I'm looking at her pilo erection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 That's when their hair stands up on the back of their neck and it seems to have gone down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=254.8s	254.8	 and subsided completely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=256.4s	256.4	 So that's nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 I mean she's a little bit more comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=259.4s	259.4	 But see she'll come and get the turkey but then she's like I'm not going to stick around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=263.7s	263.7	 past that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 You heard that growl right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=267.2s	267.2	 Now oftentimes when a dog growls we have this association that oh that means that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=271.3s	271.3	 aggressive or they're about to do something mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=274.2s	274.2	 Actually growling is a pretty good thing largely speaking because it's a dog being very open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=279.2s	279.2	 about their emotions and expressing how they feel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=282.7s	282.7	 Now I'm going to avoid standing up too suddenly right now because that's likely to make her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 a bit nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=287.9s	287.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=288.9s	288.9	 Will you sit for me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=290.9s	290.9	 No?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 Will you sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=293.9s	293.9	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=295.5s	295.5	 Major success right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=296.9s	296.9	 If a dog will take direction, treats or not from a stranger like me who has this issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 that's a step you're on the right direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 She actually just licked me on the arm right here which is another good indicator that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=308.0s	308.0	 she's becoming more comfortable with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 So I'm going to stand up now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 I'm going to go slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=312.2s	312.2	 You don't want to make too many sounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=314.2s	314.2	 She's taking a bit of a step back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=315.4s	315.4	 I've noticed that her tail is going between her legs a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 Now it's wagging a little bit but not in the good way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 So right here whenever your dog exhibits any type of anxiety like this it's important to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=329.4s	329.4	 just let them adjust for a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=330.9s	330.9	 At this point it made sense to ask Joey to begin communicating with Millie because she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=334.5s	334.5	 feels safer when he's close by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=336.8s	336.8	 I think you should show me what you've taught her overall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=338.7s	338.7	 Now if she does anything that you've taught her like sit or lie down or paw or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=342.4s	342.4	 it is that you've taught her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 Yeah she does some cute tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=346.0s	346.0	 Millie sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 It would be amazing if she would do that in my presence this close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=349.4s	349.4	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=353.4s	353.4	 Because normally she'll sit for you in that situation, is that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=356.2s	356.2	 Alright sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=357.2s	357.2	 Millie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=358.2s	358.2	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=359.2s	359.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=360.2s	360.2	 Okay good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=361.2s	361.2	 But she's still looking at me here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=362.7s	362.7	 Now you can go ahead and reward her for the sit if you'd like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 I'm going to kind of step back a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=367.3s	367.3	 Shake.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=374.4s	374.4	 Lie down.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=402.1s	402.1	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=405.1s	405.1	 I'm going to pet her underneath the chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=406.4s	406.4	 We don't want to come on over our dog's head usually.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=412.5s	412.5	 She's like wait I didn't see any turkey that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=414.4s	414.4	 I don't like you that much.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=419.4s	419.4	 I was able to touch her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=420.5s	420.5	 Just look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=421.5s	421.5	 Nice little chin scratch.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=426.8s	426.8	 is to teach them how to look at us when we ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=429.1s	429.1	 Now I wouldn't insist that she look at me right now because I make her a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=432.9s	432.9	 uncomfortable just by virtue of being a stranger in her house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=435.8s	435.8	 We can easily do this by simply holding up a piece of turkey like that although she actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=439.4s	439.4	 did look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=440.5s	440.5	 And when you have eye contact just tell her yes and give her the reward letting her know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=443.8s	443.8	 that you like that she looked at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=445.6s	445.6	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=447.8s	447.8	 Now rather than holding up a treat you'll do something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=451.6s	451.6	 Look at me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=456.1s	456.1	 So just point up here or whatever hand signal you're comfortable with but don't hold up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=459.6s	459.6	 a treat in your hand anymore.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=465.2s	465.2	 The reason we're teaching this is so that when she does become stressed or when she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=469.9s	469.9	 in a situation you can say hey Millie look at me I've got it under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=474.2s	474.2	 Everything's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=475.2s	475.2	 And then you can begin calming your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwQlrqmnNF0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=578&pp=iAQB&t=477.0s	477.0	 I'd like to try an exercise here where we get her comfortable with relaxing on this
