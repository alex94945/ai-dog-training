We'll see if I can get a handle on it in today's episode. I'm Zach George, I train dogs. This is my new dog and I'm going to show you how I train her from day one.

Oh my gosh inertia. I'm going to let you open both of these boxes at one time today bark box and super chewer are two very different monthly boxes. Tell me which one your dog would like better in the comments below or would they like them both. I've been looking forward to this box more than any box I can think of. It's the scooby doo box. It's legit. That's scooby doo. The real scooby doo inertia. That's scooby doo. He's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 more famous than you are. It like belongs on his shelf almost. I almost don't want to let inertia destroy it and the mystery machine bark box legit keeps raising the bar on their toys. Of course we've got scooby snacks. They even have like a scooby chew. Get it scooby chew. Let's see what the theme is on our super chewer. Piper space. Oh, because of hyper dogs. I get it. Every super chewer you will have choose and you'll get a couple of bags of treats here. Let's get to the star of the box. Can we just highlight how ridiculously tough this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 toy is. This is going to give you a really crazy bounce. You can even put treats inside of it. And here we have planet X. If you have like a really high energy dog with a major bite where they just love chewing stuff and you're probably more of a super chewer box kind of person. Nice throw. When you find a new toy that your dog loves you can get so much extra training mileage in. You can get a free extra month of bark box super chewer box or both when you subscribe to a six or 12 month plan by going to my special URLs barkbox.com slash dog training and super chewer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 Super chewer.com slash dog training. I'll have both of those links in the description below. As you know, one of the issues we've been dealing with with inertia is her getting very excited by things that go on outside of our window here. Remember things that move are exciting to dogs and this street in front of our house in Atlanta is way more exciting than the streets inertia is used to at our other house in New Orleans. Now that inertia has demonstrated she doesn't chew up the furniture. I have no problem with her being on the furniture. She's been doing very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 That and I have no problem with her doing exactly what she's doing right here. Just looking outside and checking things out. Today I was thinking we would make things a bit more challenging now that she's pretty successful with this barrier and this wall between her and the outside world. This is going to be my first major screensaver dog training session out here in this yard with this level of distractions. You might remember screensaver dog training is a term we've coined where you basically just find an environment that's different from your indoor environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Where you just let the world happen to you and you practice whatever it is that you're training your dog at that particular moment in that environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Come here. And so that's actually a really good example. She did extremely well as that dog went by. However, she did bark a little bit and that's normal. I mean you're not just going to go from bark bark bark to okay I'll be quiet. You're going to have like more subdued barking in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 And that's what you're seeing right now that in between phase and she even looked back at me. She's like okay what normally happens after I bark. Well my dad calls me and I get a treat. So she kind of autonomously looked at me and came over here even though she was a bit anxious and conflicted because her instincts were saying I want to interact with that dog over there. Now I will say we have recently added a front fence as a safety barrier so I feel comfortable doing this off leash since I got Scooby snacks today. We can't go wrong right. So every time we open the door. Remember that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 Remember it's stay you can even see her stay is pretty much automatic but just by virtue of opening that door remember you're introducing a ton of distractions because of the smells and sites that come rushing in just practice that one or two times just for good measure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=251.0s	251.0	 You can hear how loud it is out there. Hey good job girl. Nice job. Okay, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 So we'll walk out here. You can see she's immediately alert here and checking everything out around her. I even have a dog over here. I think she may have detected but I'll let her know it's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 And Ursa come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 Oh, and runner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 Sorry. Okay, so I'm aware that my dog is acting totally embarrassing right now, and I'm also aware that yeah I'm a professional dog trainer. Sorry. So many people might even question how can your dog be like this, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 But honestly working through behaviors that emerge like this is part of the reality of having an adolescent dog. So I love showing you the reality of working through issues like this with my own dog. Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 Okay, good girl. Good job. I love the fact that she's coming to me but she can't be doing that that is ridiculous. We've got our work cut out for us on this one don't we. So I'm going to put her on a 30 foot lead right here, because I want to be able to simulate off leash conditions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 where she's free to come and go. But I also want to make sure that if she goes into one of those fits where she starts barking at a jogger coming by so embarrassing that I can at least limit her from traumatizing anyone that comes by our front yard, and it's only a matter of time before one of these joggers is one of you guys, so I really need to get her in shape here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=335.0s	335.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=338.0s	338.0	 Come on, over here. Lie down. And so I'm really encouraged by the fact that she recovers relatively quickly after an outburst but really I want to minimize or eventually eliminate those kinds of outbursts, I'm just going to let her exist and chill for a second let her kind of get acclimated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=354.0s	354.0	 even though it's our front yard for obvious reasons we haven't been spending a lot of time out here before we have the fence installed just because of the danger factor out here, so we got a jogger across the street there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 Good girl. She's discovered her mystery machine as well. So I'm going to have that out here just so I have both types of major currencies, her two types of currencies are food and play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 We have a dog and people walking over here this is a good way to give her exposure at a distance you can see she's looking at the dog. Yes. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 All right, come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 You're good. Look at me. Okay, come. And so while we're out here you know I'm going to do light training with her come stay maybe a couple of tricks or whatever, just to get her used to listening to me out here, but the major goal of this training session is to get her to not act like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=403.0s	403.0	 a lunatic when someone comes by on the sidewalk. Stay, lie down, stand, sit, sit pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=415.0s	415.0	 Okay, good job. Hey, not bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 Okay, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=425.0s	425.0	 That was nice she looked at the person across the street there, and then decided to come to me, let me see if I can get her playing out here. Good job. Ready, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=436.0s	436.0	 Like you're a dog barking somewhere I wonder if that's going to throw her off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=440.0s	440.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 Okay, come, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=446.0s	446.0	 Nice job. Over here. Come around, stay, lie down. Good. Wait, when she does become distracted, calling her to me is something I really want to burn through her brain I want her to really understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=459.0s	459.0	 I want you coming to me. When you're distracted. Looks like we have a dog way in the distance that might be making their way, which is a fairly ideal training scenario, just in case she gets overly excited I'm going to make sure I have a hold of her long lead here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 I hope to not have to restrain her at all though but I'm going to get nice and low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=476.0s	476.0	 Be close to her good girl. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=479.0s	479.0	 Got a jogger coming up as well on this side so double distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=484.0s	484.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=487.0s	487.0	 It's a pretty dog stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=491.0s	491.0	 She's about to be surprised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=494.0s	494.0	 Yes, good lie down. You almost saw her think about barking there I was able to intervene there and get the attention on me before the outburst occurred that really is your best time dogs will give you a little bit of foreshadowing just about all of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 For example, you'll see their eyes light up or their ears perk up and they look very alert, sometimes they only give you a microseconds notice, focus on really getting to know your dog in that way, and that'll put you in a much better position to work on issues like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=523.0s	523.0	 And if you're not at that point yet remember, I have an entire book on this actually to all have links below. When we first came out here she was pretty reactive and barking at the joggers and everything, but just by virtue of being out here for I don't know 1520 minutes so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=538.0s	538.0	 She's like, okay, I've adjusted. I still want to bark and chase but I have some guidance here from my dad I'm pretty open to listening. And that's why so much repetition is required when you're doing screensaver training like this, the more we do this the shorter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=552.0s	552.0	 that adjustment time becomes until she's just generalized the good behavior that we want her to possess at all times. So we have another dog coming across the street here, see if she notices stay inertia come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=566.0s	566.0	 No, come. Hey, let out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=569.0s	569.0	 So good example there that's now two successes we've had with dog across the street that have walked by without her going nuts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=580.0s	580.0	 Right there. Yep. So the jogger is walking and then he started jogging up and that's when she's like oh my gosh, what are you running from the lead came in very handy there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=590.0s	590.0	 So I was able to intercept the behavior and at least stop it. Okay, inertia, lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=596.0s	596.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=597.0s	597.0	 There's a jogger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=599.0s	599.0	 Good girl. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=603.0s	603.0	 Victory moment right there a jogger right in front of the fence, and she acted like a well behaved young lady inertia come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=612.0s	612.0	 Good. Lie down. Good girl. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=616.0s	616.0	 Good girl. That's it. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=621.0s	621.0	 Good job. You know it's common when we're training dogs to think what do I do after the outburst occurs, the only thing you can do is manage your dog get them under control, have them on leash get them away from the thing that's causing them to react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=634.0s	634.0	 But if you're really on top of things and you can intervene before the outburst occurs that's where you're going to see your gains and successes come, I'm under no illusions that this particular training session is going to solve everything I've got to do this a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=649.0s	649.0	 All right, another jogger coming up over here, and she's right up on him inertia come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=655.0s	655.0	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=657.0s	657.0	 Come here, lie down. Perfect stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=664.0s	664.0	 Yes, love how she looked at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=667.0s	667.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=669.0s	669.0	 I believe it look at me combo that was an example she looked at the distraction, and then looked at me so I was able to give her guidance there so that was terrific. We have another exciting dog coming up, she's already spotted the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=681.0s	681.0	 She's possible before I do stay. So I'm looking for five seconds of staying, then I'll give her a tiny piece of a Scooby snack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=689.0s	689.0	 Girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=690.0s	690.0	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=692.0s	692.0	 Good girl. I know you hear that conflicted vocalization. Good girl I know it's hard, you're doing great. Stay. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=703.0s	703.0	 Wow. Okay, go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=706.0s	706.0	 So there I decided to reward with a toy, lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=710.0s	710.0	 Good. Let's see if I can get her to do a stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=714.0s	714.0	 Stand, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=716.0s	716.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=718.0s	718.0	 Get it.

So she has an outlet to run and chase things that's also going to go a long way.

I love that automatic look at me right there she's giving me, and it's worth mentioning I'm rewarding extra here because there's a lot of different variables in this particular training session than she's used to.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=767.0s	767.0	 You are healing so well. How do you do that? Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=771.0s	771.0	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=772.0s	772.0	 Okay, come back here. Yeah, let's go. Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=777.0s	777.0	 Okay, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=779.0s	779.0	 You know, over here, stay here. Yes and switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=783.0s	783.0	 Good. Okay, come on. Let's go and switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=787.0s	787.0	 Give me a switch one more. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=790.0s	790.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=792.0s	792.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=796.0s	796.0	 Yes. Good girl. You know, it's one thing when she can see a dog coming at a distance but very often, you know, a dog or a person or some type of distraction will just appear. Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=807.0s	807.0	 So I'll put her in a down stay. So something I'm going to do here as these joggers come by is I'm going to create distance. I'm going to walk away, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=814.0s	814.0	 I mean, maybe you're doing yard work or something like that. You want to know that your dog isn't going to react crazy or you're on the phone, and you want to know that you don't have to be right on top of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=823.0s	823.0	 Nice job. I love that. And this is why I'm not afraid to show you when my own dog does not behave. Ideally, this is part of the process because if you understand that it's normal, well, I think you're much more likely to be more patient with your dog and not give up so easily and be encouraged to work with them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=853.0s	853.0	 It's kind of inspiring me. You want to start jogging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTi71Je1g_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=278&pp=iAQB&t=857.0s	857.0	 Yes. All right. Looks like we're going to become joggers.
