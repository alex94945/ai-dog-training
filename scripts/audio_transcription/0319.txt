https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 What is happening right now? I'm Zach George, I train dogs and this is my new dog inertia. I'm taking you along as I train her from day one, you can start from the beginning or pick up anywhere and start learning. Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=17.4s	17.4	 Today we'll do some more leash training with inertia teach her some brand new tricks and hopefully achieve a breakthrough on settling down in the house. Of course, we'll focus more on socialization too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 Today's video is brought to you sponsor free by our amazing patrons on Patreon.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=40.9s	40.9	 Let's see how inertia is settle is looking you want to come over here having a puppy means eventually teaching them how to coexist in the house with us and getting them to just tune out and settle down sometimes I'm going to see if she relaxes on her own right here the frog legs indicate that she's a little relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 You'll recall we've been working on this pretty much from day one since you really need to rely on capturing a behavior catching your dog doing it naturally results are much longer. But this is the best way to get it that I know of because you're actually acknowledging when your dog is in a relaxed state of mind can see she's trying to chew on the leather couch. I don't like that at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 Leave it alone. Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 Yes, good work. I'm gonna go ahead and give her a treat for honoring the leave it requests there. In general, I don't reward settles with treats too much because it keeps a dog really on alert rather than just getting them to relax. In this case, I'm more using the environment as a reinforcer. She would rather be out here than say in her crate, for example. So that's really what I'm relying on to reinforce the behavior. While she seems to be perfectly accepting of her crate. It's natural for dogs to want to be near us wherever we are. So I think that she would still prefer to be out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 And ultimately, we'll work up to that. Now I'd like to attempt to walk away and hopefully she'll hold that position. I'm not going to tell her to stay. I've offered her this choose. So she has something to do. Now it's a bit of a risky strategy because this could also trigger excitement from her. So I don't know how it's gonna go. Check her out there. Now she broke her settle. Let me see if she resumes it going back at the carpet. And see, this is why dogs should be on leash under supervision when they're 12 weeks old. You can't you can't trust a puppy not to do things that come natural to them like to carpet. Okay, she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=137.8s	137.8	 She didn't go back into her settle like I'd hoped. So let's see if I can encourage her to do so. So let me go ahead and reset her over here. By reset, I mean put her into a sit and a down. Take away the chew toy here settle. I'm going to hang out here for a sec to see if she tunes out nice settle. I'm going to walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=157.3s	157.3	 inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=157.9s	157.9	 Settle remember that settle is where your dog is in that relaxed frame of mind. So that's what I'm trying to encourage here. Not necessarily a traditional lie down and stay, but a relaxed lie down and stay. Maybe she'll even take a nap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=171.7s	171.7	 That was a good example where I interrupted and I was able to get her back into a settle by asking her now. That's a fine line. If she were to get up immediately and break her settle, that would be my cue. She's really not in a relaxed frame of mind and I would need to go down my list and make sure that I've given her enough exercise for the day. Make sure I've given her enough training inertia. Settle. Good job. I saw she was thinking about getting up. I interrupted her there and encouraged her to hold her settle and she actually seemed to honor that request. I love it. I can't believe she's getting up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=201.7s	201.7	 I can't count on that happening every time. I may have gotten a little lucky there, but this is how it looks in the very beginning stages. Check it out. We've been having a meeting for like the last 30 minutes or so and inertia has been holding her settle. We're going to start a time lapse now and see how long she holds that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=217.7s	217.7	 You know, we want to do a quick 30 second side bit on. Wow. Do you know how dogs perceive the world? Dogs have a million trillion sensors in their nose and they smell in stereo, you know, stuff like that. Like little.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=231.7s	231.7	 Maybe, maybe, or it can be anything. Our meeting was going great, but then the doorbell rang as a package was being delivered. She got up. Look at that. Okay. So, oh, don't let her go. Look at this. She's running towards the door right now. Grab that camera. All right, because we got a package. That's one of the first time she's really reacted to a doorbell. Want to show her that I prefer a different behavior. Yes. Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=261.7s	261.7	 So I'm going to escort her back to her settle. Come here. Will you settle?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 Will you lie down? Yes. Settle. I'm just looking at her eyes. I'm reading her body language. She looks genuinely relaxed to me, shifting, getting comfortable. The next step here would be to introduce artificial distractions like have Bri go outside or I go outside and ring the doorbell while one person is sitting there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=291.7s	291.7	 And the other person is right there prepared to redirect her back into that settle. But since this is really new behavior, I'm going to hold off on making it more challenging this quickly. Update on settle training. She was feeling a bit frisky and wanting to walk around a little bit more than I was willing to be tolerant of. So I had to go into her crate. She doesn't view the crate as a bad place to go. She would probably definitely rather be out, but I have work to do and I know that I've trained her and I've exercised hers. I feel fine about having her spend some alone time in her bedroom right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=321.7s	321.7	 I have been dealing with increased whining in the crate lately. The way I've been dealing with it is ignoring it almost all of the time, waiting for even brief periods of non whining before I let her out. And of course, making sure that she's had her exercise and her training while inertia was taking a nap. The yard guys have returned and she's doing so well. That's a dramatic improvement right there. She's not frantic. She's just like, whatever. I've heard this before. It was fine. Settle training still has a ways to go. But this was a very productive training session. We're taking inertia out of her crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=351.7s	351.7	 We've seen her out of the house a lot and showing her new things. Today we're taking her back to our friend's house who has Satchmo, the giant Irish wolfhound and some cats. Want to say hi? Okay. Say hi. Be careful though. I think Satchmo is bored with inertia. The last time inertia and Satchmo hung out, it was a bit much for her. Let's see how this visit goes. When you're socializing your dog, be aware of any potential things in the environment that could cause things to go wrong. In this case, there was some food on the ground. And while inertia has yet to display resource guarding behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=381.7s	381.7	 now would not be the time that I want to discover that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=384.6s	384.6	 Hey, I'm going to pick you up. Because I don't know if she might snap over it. You know what? That's not your food. This is Satchmo's food. Here you go Satchmo. Stay away from Satchmo's food. Say hi. You being a good girl? Yeah, that's good. See, that's how she learns to interact with cats. She's still like processing all of that. Let's see if she's learned her lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=403.8s	403.8	 What is that? Satchmo is still a lot to take in for inertia, but she's getting a little bit braver than before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=415.8s	415.8	 Does she though? Yeah, she's just not quite brave enough. She's like, I don't know. I like that toy, but he's so big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=425.9s	425.9	 If your dog has issues with other dogs, or you want my advice on training your dog, pick up one or both of my books. They're an excellent quick reference companion to these videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=433.9s	433.9	 Things went well with Satchmo. Now let's see how things are going between inertia and Indy when they play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=441.9s	441.9	 Nice job, Indy. That's friendly warning. I like it. Can I have a sit? Yes, I'm going to use environment as the reward. Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=450.0s	450.0	 Because I don't have a leash on inertia here, I'll have to use minor restraint by grabbing her harness, but don't confuse this with a harsh physical correction advocated for by old fashioned dog trainers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=460.0s	460.0	 Indy and inertia are getting along very well, and inertia is learning how much play is appropriate play, because Indy has given her lots of feedback, and I think they're starting to enjoy one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=470.0s	470.0	 Now that inertia and Indy have had some play time, let's see what else we can teach inertia. I've been wanting to teach inertia how to give a hug from behind me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=476.1s	476.1	 I think we could get some cool pictures like this. Plus, there's nothing like receiving a hug from a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=480.1s	480.1	 So I'm going to get her warmed up with a sit, a wait, because I find myself telling her wait because I'm about to encourage her to break her sit, but I'm not telling her that she's free after she breaks her sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=492.1s	492.1	 Like normally I'll say sit. Okay, good. So, you know, all done. Good job. But this time I'm going to be telling her sit and wait for another direction that I'm going to put on top of sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=501.2s	501.2	 All right, sit, wait. I'm just going to encourage her to jump up and get it. Come on. Yes. There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=512.2s	512.2	 I'm letting her nibble this piece of meat here as I'm holding her in position. Yes. Let me release her. Okay, get down. All done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=523.2s	523.2	 This way. Yes. Good job. Couldn't get her down. Wasn't that funny?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=527.2s	527.2	 I decided to release her at the last second because I'm like, well, I wanted to know that she doesn't have to do it for infinity, that there is an end in sight. And that's kind of the workflow. You get up there, you stay until I tell you to get down. Then you get down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=538.2s	538.2	 I'm going to attempt an unconventional way of teaching a back stall. That's where your dog, you know, gets on your back and they stay there. Let me see if we can evolve hug into something resembling a back stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=551.2s	551.2	 Here we go. Come on up here. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=554.3s	554.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=556.3s	556.3	 Good. Sure. All right. I'm going to try to roll forward. You want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=561.3s	561.3	 Yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=564.3s	564.3	 Yeah. What's up? What's happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=567.3s	567.3	 What's happening? I don't know. What do you think? It's actually happening. First time and we recorded it. Okay, get down. Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=575.4s	575.4	 Nice job. That was so much fun. I can't wait to see where that goes. Teaching unusual outside the box tricks like that is one of those things that really builds your confidence as a trainer and builds a dog's confidence and makes it really exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=588.4s	588.4	 It kind of motivates both of you to really just keep training. Let's do a check in and see how her other tricks are going. Can you give me a play dead?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=595.5s	595.5	 Wait. Yes. See, wait is starting to come in handy and that's a big one. Wait. Yes. Let's test hand signal real quick on wave. Inertia. Wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=608.5s	608.5	 She's like, okay, I've learned a lot of things in the last few weeks. Let me just see if I can recall what this means. It's important to give your dog time to process a request, especially when it's new. Yes. There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=619.6s	619.6	 You want to do a somersault? Stand. Wait. Somersault. Let's fake her out. I'm not going to lure her with an actual treat. Stand. Wait. And somersault. The treat. But I'll give her a treat now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=634.6s	634.6	 So that's like the very beginning stages of treating after to eventually treating randomly. For a trick like somersault, she can have a treat every single time she does that one. Tricks like that, I think you should pay your dogs very well when they do extracurricular tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=648.6s	648.6	 Until this point, I've only been doing indoor leash training with inertia. So I'm going to start phasing in easy outdoor leash walking vastly different. Anytime you're outside, the smells and distractions are way intensified in an outdoor environment. Come on over here. Okay. Good job. Hey, inertia over here. Can I have your attention? Little anxiety there. She's like, what are we doing? So let me see if I can get her in a better mood here. Yes. Good. I'm going to give her some more treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=678.6s	678.6	 Easy stuff to do. Look at me. Good. You can see how the treats even real meat that I'm using today are only okay to her. Come on. Yes. Good job. Just responding to come on right there. I'm rewarding that right here. Yes. Right there. She didn't lunge towards the studio, which is what she's used to doing inertia just loves grabbing things off the ground. This has been an issue. Can I have this? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I have this leave? Leave it alone. Get it. Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=708.6s	708.6	 Leave it. Look at me. Yes. Good girl. I think I'll take this with me and add it to my training. Okay, come on. Let's go. Yes. Good girl. Wonderful. Okay, let's go this way. See, I'm changing directions randomly right now just to get her focusing on me. Okay, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=728.2s	728.2	 Yes, just stomping on the ground there getting a little more peppy to really inspire her to want to come to me. Hey, remember that leaf? Let's bring it back and surprise her with it. See this leave it. Look at me. There we go. She may have to pee so I'm going to let her smell around here for a second. By the way, potty training is going well. She hasn't had a potty accident in many consecutive days. She's running there. I'm going to stop and inertia is pretty easy to do. Okay, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=758.2s	758.2	 I'm going to be over this lease training session and that would be a good time to take a break. But sometimes I'll try and work her through this type of frustration and sometimes I'll conclude the lesson. It just depends. My expectations are quite low for this outdoor lease training exercise. I'm just trying to get her to pay some attention to me since this is her first time doing a serious lease training session outdoors. This doesn't mean all of my lease training sessions are just going to happen outdoors. Now I still have a lot of work to do on indoor lease training to try and get that looking better and better and then just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=788.2s	788.2	 kind of phasing in outdoor lease training. But it doesn't happen all at one time. That's what people fail to understand about teaching dogs a lot of the time is that it's not a linear process. It's a little bit forward, a little bit back, a little bit forward, a little bit back. And you just kind of have to slowly trend towards progress rather than achieving it all at one time. We live in Louisiana where thunderstorms are common. It's also common for many dogs to become nervous around thunderstorms. So I'm taking a proactive approach to this by showing inertia that when lightning and thunder occur,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=818.2s	818.2	 her life gets extra good. Pretty serious storm is coming through right now. So as the lightning flashes have been happening in the distance, I've been quickly getting over to inertia and giving her a treat. It's been ideal because this is an approaching storm. And there was like 10 seconds between the flash and the actual thunder. So it gave me plenty of notice to jump up, grab a treat, get over here and be there to pair the thunder with an amazing reward. There's a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=848.2s	848.2	 dimension to training settle now. So I'm going to try to condition her to be calm while a storm is approaching. I'm going to go ahead and reward with food here just to contradict myself. Because what I find is that sometimes her being in a calm state of mind and just being out with everybody is reinforcing enough. Other times, it seems a good idea to provide a small treat. There's no right or wrong answer. It's all contextual. I've got to go get some medicine for inertia, but I have to walk all the way to that kitchen. So I'm going to ask her to wait. Let's see how it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=878.2s	878.2	 goes. Wait. I'm gonna walk slowly as to not encourage her to follow me. So this is pretty cool. I can do a long distance but still insight weight. So it means she can see me which makes it easier for her. Now what would I do if she were to break? I would just go and escort her back and ask her to hold that settle and then not push her to failure. But look how stable she is right now. So I've just prepared her pill. I'm going to reaffirm. Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=908.2s	908.2	 Yes. And to me, weight means I'm going to ask you to do something in a second. Look at me. Yes. There you go. That medicine is good. Pill pockets are great for giving your dog medication. All done. I'm going to do some brush training right now. I'm letting her smell the brush here just to reintroduce her. My actual last brush lesson with her didn't go very smoothly.

It might seem odd to start with the legs a place that you might not brush so much but it keeps it in view. Let's her see what it does. I've got it tucked away like this. I'm holding it and making a really fight for that tree but it keeps her attention and I can release just a little bit at a time. Look at that. She's doing great with brushing. She noticed it. I'll let her take a look at it. Smell it. Brush training is going well. Let's check out Stan. I'm taking her leash off because I feel pretty confident that she's going to stay around.

Good generalization there because that's a completely different hand signal. I usually do it right handed. Yes. OK. Good job. Wait. You could just read her eyes. She's like OK. Let me think about this one. Yes. OK. Wait. Which one is that. Really well. Hug.

I was getting greedy there. Hug. Let me see if I can get her back up and then release her pretty quickly. Let her know that's not how the trick ends. OK. Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1042.2s	1042.2	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1047.2s	1047.2	 OK. All done. Get down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1051.2s	1051.2	 OK. Good job. It's time for puppy class again. Got some new dogs in class today so she'll meet a couple of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1057.2s	1057.2	 A couple of different dogs should be a pretty big class today so that's exciting. This is a new dog she's never met.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1064.2s	1064.2	 Nice. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1070.2s	1070.2	 Play nice.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1077.2s	1077.2	 Hey. Hey. Too nippy. Too nippy. I don't like that. I don't like that. Too rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1082.2s	1082.2	 So we're working on touch in puppy class right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1085.2s	1085.2	 Touch. Yes. Great way to build communication with your dog. Teaching them stuff like this. Yes. Good. Can you give me a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1096.2s	1096.2	 Letter thing. Yes. Good. Can I get a touch. Yes. That was brilliant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1104.2s	1104.2	 Can I get a. Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1112.2s	1112.2	 I'm going to test a surprise. Leave it. We haven't done that in class so I'm not going to give her notice. I'm going to drop a piece of chicken in front of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 Hey. Leave it. Yes. Good. Big reward. About half of the treat there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1126.2s	1126.2	 This is the most dog she's been around at one time ever. So let's see how she does on this round.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1132.2s	1132.2	 Oh my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1136.2s	1136.2	 Oh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1140.2s	1140.2	 Good girl. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1144.2s	1144.2	 That's better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1147.2s	1147.2	 Puppy class isn't just a great opportunity to socialize and play with your dog but it's really great for introducing this concept of listening to you around heavy distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_WRUpl1JM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=320&pp=iAQB&t=1156.2s	1156.2	 So using a high value currency, allowing your dog time to adjust to all of these dogs are important ingredients for getting your dog to listen to you in distracting situations.

She's not there yet. I'll show you how we're dealing with whining in the crate and much more. We'll see you guys in the next episode.
