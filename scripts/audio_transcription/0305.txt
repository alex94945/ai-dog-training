https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=24.3s	24.3	 Inertia is quite conditioned to immediately investigate a new bar clock

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 They've basically taken something similar and combined it with a ballerina bottom to dogs that makes perfect sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 Always high quality toys the squeaks are always really good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=86.1s	86.1	 We're going to do an unplanned dog training experience lesson here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=91.4s	91.4	 You might notice her keep away right now is probably worse than ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=95.1s	95.1	 I really feel like I need to address that because this is an out-of-control habit and her so you've got to bring that back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=99.9s	99.9	 to me usually I won't use treats when I'm training fetch because I want the dog amped up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=105.3s	105.3	 Wanting to play and be energetic so that I can get their energy out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=108.2s	108.2	 But right now I'm not really interested in playing a game of fetch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=110.9s	110.9	 So I'm not worried about quelling her desire to play in fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=113.9s	113.9	 I'd kind of prefer it right now. I'm gonna use treats. I'm gonna let her know I have this. Hey inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=118.9s	118.9	 Get her attention. What's that? Oh, I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 What's this? Do you want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=124.8s	124.8	 Good very good. Good job. Sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 Good fantastic. Okay, you can go play with it. So I'm gonna let her go back to the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=136.4s	136.4	 Intershirt come here, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=138.4s	138.4	 See I'm not just holding the treat out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=140.4s	140.4	 I'm actually tossing it to make it more exciting cuz saying hey come here with a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=143.6s	143.6	 She's like no, I'm really into this toy right now and I really want to enjoy it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=147.4s	147.4	 I want to show her there's a certain way to enjoy this toy when you're training a dog you have to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=152.7s	152.7	 Ridiculously repetitive sometimes to really get them to understand what you want get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=157.5s	157.5	 So I'm just gonna run through this a few times. So she starts to equate it inertia come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=162.3s	162.3	 Nice come here right now. I don't even care if she brings the toy to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=165.7s	165.7	 I want her coming to me at the very least when I call her if your dog is really out of control with keep away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 Like that. It's also advisable to have them on lead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 We are in the early stages of letting inertia explore the house off leash like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=178.2s	178.2	 So in this case the treats were enough to get her attention on me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 But I would absolutely consider putting her back on lead in a situation like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=184.6s	184.6	 So I'm just gonna let her go back to the toy and I'm gonna let her know I have this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=188.3s	188.3	 I'm not gonna let her know that I have this on me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=190.4s	190.4	 But I would absolutely consider putting her back on lead in a situation like this in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=194.7s	194.7	 I'm about to do a training session with inertia and I was like, hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=197.8s	197.8	 Why don't I throw the toy a few times for her get some of that excess energy out to really prime her for an optimized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=204.2s	204.2	 Training session inertia. I'm over here. Come here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=210.4s	210.4	 If I pretend like I'm gonna go she gets closer to me and go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=215.7s	215.7	 That's right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 I think she's telling me she wants to go inside. She keeps running into the studio and then coming back out one more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 Okay, I'll take it I've been pretty consistent about one more and meaning it so I'll usually give her notice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=231.6s	231.6	 Look, this is the last one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 Give me one more something that I need to revisit now with inertia is hold you might recall that we've been teaching her how to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 Hold on to this but her tendency is to like hold on to it and then let it go sometimes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 What I'm ultimately trying to teach her is hey hold on to this thing this random thing and stay right here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=249.1s	249.1	 Hold is the foundation for so many useful behaviors moving forward. So we're gonna work on that for a bit hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=255.6s	255.6	 Wait, I'm gonna try to implement weight withhold because what I'm trying to teach her about weight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 Is that it's an instant freeze position like stop right there at least in most cases that I can think of right now. Okay, wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=268.1s	268.1	 Yes, good. She tends to back away a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=271.4s	271.4	 I really just want her staying still but I'll take the fact that she's holding for duration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=275.7s	275.7	 Over the fact that she's backing up when she's not supposed to what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=279.5s	279.5	 Get it. Wait. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 Real close right there. You could also use a clicker if you were clicker training here or say yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=288.8s	288.8	 Yes, good girl, I don't want her letting go on the word. Yes, I need to work on that as well wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 Let go I wanted to give her a victory there. Yes, give her a bunch of little small treats get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=301.3s	301.3	 Hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=303.3s	303.3	 Let go. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=305.3s	305.3	 So there I'm actually telling her let go before she lets go in the hope that she will hold on to it until I ask her to let go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=313.3s	313.3	 Get it. Wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=315.3s	315.3	 Let go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 Yes, that was looking good. Still only a brief second. Hold it. I would love to get three seconds or longer almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=324.3s	324.3	 Here get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=326.3s	326.3	 Here hold it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=328.3s	328.3	 Let go. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=330.3s	330.3	 Yes, you can really read her eyes there. You can see that she's really processing it hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=337.1s	337.1	 Let go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=338.5s	338.5	 Yes, since she's pretty good about hold and let go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=341.3s	341.3	 I also want to make sure that I focus on acknowledging her success while she's holding on to the object
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=346.6s	346.6	 wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=350.1s	350.1	 Let go yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=352.5s	352.5	 I'm gonna give her a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=354.6s	354.6	 Big jackpot reward there that was the best example to date of hold and really starting to get the concept
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=361.1s	361.1	 That's where we currently are on hold for a period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 I'm going to continue to work on that and i'll keep you posted if you're new to dog training, too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=367.9s	367.9	 Don't forget about both of my books
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=369.7s	369.7	 My first book here is really designed for the person who's thinking about getting a dog or has recently gotten a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=375.3s	375.3	 It provides a big overview of how to raise a dog and this one is if you've had a dog for a little while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=381.1s	381.1	 But you're really experiencing some issues with them. I'll cover the most common training problems in this book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 I'll have links in the description where you can pick them up. We've been working on crawl and she's doing really well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=391.6s	391.6	 But the thing about crawl is you can't work on it too long with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=394.3s	394.3	 She starts to get frustrated and starts doing her play deads and everything to try and figure out what it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=399.5s	399.5	 She's supposed to do and if you think about it like crawling is an acquired skill at least to crawl in the fashion that we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=404.9s	404.9	 Asking her to do it. I intend to keep this particular training session pretty short
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=409.5s	409.5	 But we'll see how it goes. I'm gonna start with a sit sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=413.3s	413.3	 Give her something really easy to do just to set the tone for the rest of the training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=417.6s	417.6	 That's the point of doing that let them know. Hey, there's a high probability. You're going to win a prize sit and down good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=424.2s	424.2	 Let's go ahead and reward on down even though it's pretty well established
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=427.1s	427.1	 The last time we did this I was luring and I was focused on trying to get that lure farther and farther away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=432.4s	432.4	 But I don't want to have to be like right next to my dog luring them in order to teach them to crawl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=437.3s	437.3	 What we're trying to break new ground on is getting her to crawl with that lure farther away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=442.9s	442.9	 So it's a little more impressive looking. Can you give me a play dead?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=446.7s	446.7	 I love it. I've been having trouble with play dead quite honestly. It hasn't been the most natural thing for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 So when she's been offering it or in the mood to do it, I've been like, okay, we can do a play dead training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=456.2s	456.2	 wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=457.9s	457.9	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=459.7s	459.7	 Oops, if I get too far away, she gets up. So if i'm like crawl crawl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=464.3s	464.3	 Oh, that was pretty good. That was pretty good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=466.8s	466.8	 I think I gotta reward that you saw how she started to get up a little at the end and I don't want that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=471.1s	471.1	 To become a habit, but that's better than she's been doing. Okay, we're gonna crawl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=478.7s	478.7	 I really should have rewarded that because she's trying harder and making more progress. So if she does that again, i'll reward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=484.0s	484.0	 It's her coming up at the end. I was starting to get greedy and trying to push her. Okay crawl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=491.6s	491.6	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=492.8s	492.8	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=494.5s	494.5	 So rather than the lure being right here. It was right here. See that good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=501.2s	501.2	 That was really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=503.1s	503.1	 So i'm gonna try this completely different body position. Okay, let's try this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=507.5s	507.5	 Whoa, good. It's the small things she started to get up and she like self-corrected. So I like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=514.3s	514.3	 Wait, can you crawl notice my body position too? It's completely different than before. That was amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=520.3s	520.3	 She's really starting to get it you crawl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=524.3s	524.3	 Oh my gosh, I can't believe how quickly she's getting this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=530.0s	530.0	 Crawl oh my goodness, that's wonderful. She's not done anything like that. That's brand new behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=535.3s	535.3	 So i'm really enthused by that. We're gonna stop there. It's a pretty physical trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=539.6s	539.6	 I love that her progress is amazing. Sometimes it's tempting to just keep going and keep going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=544.5s	544.5	 But in this case, we'll end on a good note
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=546.6s	546.6	 This is a trick we've been working on for weeks and weeks and we had just been stuck at this singular point of having to lure her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=553.8s	553.8	 Really closely and then she's just now putting it together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=556.6s	556.6	 It's just really awesome to watch her figure out new things when you see that light bulb going off with the dog in training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=561.8s	561.8	 There's just nothing like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=563.2s	563.2	 Let's do an update on how inertia is doing when it comes to getting on the furniture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=568.2s	568.2	 You might remember probably a few weeks ago that she had developed the habit pretty organically just when she would get hyper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=574.7s	574.7	 She would jump up on the furniture very often people ask how do you get your dog to not jump on the furniture?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=580.0s	580.0	 How do you get them to stop doing it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=581.5s	581.5	 And ideally if you have a new dog you prevent the habit from getting established to begin with so it's never an issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=587.1s	587.1	 After i've done basic training with her or exercise with her i'll encourage her to do like a sit or a down stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=592.8s	592.8	 Well, i've been encouraging her to hold these positions whether it's a sit a down now if she were to get on the furniture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=598.1s	598.1	 I would simply redirect her and encourage her to hold that position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=601.2s	601.2	 But preventing the habit from getting established in the first place is really what's making all the difference with this by having her drag around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=608.1s	608.1	 The liege wall in the house. I'm in a position to keep her from running and jumping on things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=613.5s	613.5	 You might notice here. She does have an interest in furniture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=616.9s	616.9	 Maybe she's not interested in jumping on it, but she is a little interested in chewing on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=621.1s	621.1	 I can say we've had no major furniture damage at all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=623.8s	623.8	 But this is against the reason supervision is so important even though inertia has her adult teeth here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=629.5s	629.5	 She's still going through a teething phase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=631.6s	631.6	 So it's important to make sure that your dog has plenty of things to chew on and you're still supervising leave it alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=637.6s	637.6	 Will you lie down i'm gonna give her an alternative incompatible behavior in this case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=641.5s	641.5	 It's lie down out of the reach of the table all in all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=644.3s	644.3	 She isn't jumping on the furniture right now and i'm going to attribute that to good management
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=649.8s	649.8	 And showing her the behaviors I prefer that she do instead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=653.6s	653.6	 It's really intuitive for us to wait until a problem occurs to then try to repair it and fix it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=659.1s	659.1	 But that is the less preferable way to address unwanted behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=664.2s	664.2	 If your dog did already have the habit of jumping on the furniture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=667.0s	667.0	 Just be consistent about showing them what you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=669.3s	669.3	 It's going to take significantly longer to get them to acquire the habit of not jumping on the furniture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=674.3s	674.3	 But you'll get there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=675.1s	675.1	 You just have to be overwhelmingly consistent in showing your dog what you do want them to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=679.6s	679.6	 One of my favorite tricks that i've taught inertia so far is how to give a hug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=682.7s	682.7	 I'm sure you've seen that by now, but it still needs some polishing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=686.3s	686.3	 It's not ideal and this is the thing about tricks your first or second or third drafts of those tricks aren't usually the finished ones
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=693.2s	693.2	 For example, let me show you what i'm saying here. You see how she jumps up and gives me a hug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=697.1s	697.1	 She's really having issues with paws being on one side over here. Although I am gonna focus on weight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=702.5s	702.5	 Did you notice how she got down really quickly a moment ago?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=708.0s	708.0	 Okay get down so I have two things to focus on teaching her to hold the position and teaching her how to put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=713.4s	713.4	 One paw on each side of my neck here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=715.4s	715.4	 I don't even know if that's how it's going to ultimately be maybe she's just never comfortable doing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=719.9s	719.9	 So i'm always prepared to accept what she's willing to give me but i'm going to try to teach her what I want here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=725.2s	725.2	 sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=726.2s	726.2	 wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=727.8s	727.8	 Hugs look how she goes from side to side there. This is a mess. This is a mess. Wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=733.5s	733.5	 Call her and see i'm having brie mark the behavior because I can't see what she's doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=737.1s	737.1	 Hug doesn't look real good if they're looking down. Go ahead again brie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=740.7s	740.7	 Go ahead and give her a yes when she looks up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=745.0s	745.0	 Uh, well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=747.4s	747.4	 Yes, good i'm right here i'm going to reward the correction for putting her both paws there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=753.1s	753.1	 wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=755.6s	755.6	 Okay, good job get down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=757.9s	757.9	 Let's see if we can try that again and get a more successful version of hug hug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=762.4s	762.4	 Oh, yes. There we go. Just took a little reminder. Go ahead and call her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=766.2s	766.2	 Inertia before you say yes insist that she hold it for more a longer period of time, please
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=780.3s	780.3	 Yes, good good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=782.5s	782.5	 I gave her a giant reward there and that was pushing it like you could make the case that maybe we should have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=787.4s	787.4	 Rewarded her for those small successes because she really was trying okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=791.3s	791.3	 And I like how she's waiting until I say okay, so she knows the trick is over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=794.8s	794.8	 It's always worth underscoring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=796.8s	796.8	 That tricks like this have far-reaching benefit to all of your training. So before you tell yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=804.2s	804.2	 i'm not so interested in tricks weigh how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=808.0s	808.0	 Important they are for building broad generalized communication so that you can ultimately just talk to your dog tricks like that build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=816.6s	816.6	 communication between you and your dog wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=819.6s	819.6	 Take a bow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=822.6s	822.6	 Love it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=825.0s	825.0	 Wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=827.3s	827.3	 Your take a bow looks great. I wonder if we can get her to put that head down a little bit more. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=834.5s	834.5	 Yes, wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=836.9s	836.9	 Isn't that great I love how she's resting her head on the ground there take about is just turning out to be one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=841.2s	841.2	 My favorite tricks to do with her. She really seems to enjoy it and she's excelling with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=844.8s	844.8	 So i've been doing it a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=846.2s	846.2	 Conversely when there are tricks that she's not enjoying as much I kind of ease up on those like play dead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=851.0s	851.0	 Which we talked about i'm trying to kind of counter condition her and get her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=854.8s	854.8	 More willing to do things like play dead and other tricks that she might not be feeling right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=861.0s	861.0	 Okay, this should be interesting because we're going to be taking inertia to jefferson feed and garden center here in new orleans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=866.3s	866.3	 Where there's going to be other animals food for other animals and lots of other distracting things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=871.6s	871.6	 She was reluctant to come in there. I just took like a minute or two maybe three letter smell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=877.0s	877.0	 Evaluate the scene see what was going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=879.3s	879.3	 This is her very first time actually being able to walk around in a pet supply store like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=883.9s	883.9	 Last time she was in a place like she wasn't allowed to walk on the floor because of her vaccination status
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=888.9s	888.9	 Gotta be pretty crazy for her. I'm just gonna walk around with her for a little bit here and then give her the opportunity to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=894.6s	894.6	 Do some training. Hey, what's going on guys? I'm at the pet supply store jefferson feed right now in new orleans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=901.6s	901.6	 And doing some general socializing and training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=905.2s	905.2	 With inertia hello
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=908.2s	908.2	 Say hi, thank you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=912.5s	912.5	 Good girl, don't you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=914.4s	914.4	 Nice job. Thanks. Look how interested she is in just smelling everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=918.7s	918.7	 She's no doubt smelling things that she's never smelled before and that must be very interesting to her some dogs over adoption over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=926.3s	926.3	 See how she does pretty close range. She's just realized her cats over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=931.2s	931.2	 Now if she were reacting and barking I wouldn't be here but she's being pretty good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=934.9s	934.9	 So I want to give her the opportunity to explore when she's behaving calmly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=938.3s	938.3	 She's unsure of the cat our cat has trained her to be quite skeptical of cats so far. That's good. Those things swat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=945.3s	945.3	 Can you give me a play dead?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=947.2s	947.2	 Yes, she's open to doing a play dead in public. That really makes me happy. Can you play dead?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=954.4s	954.4	 Oh, wow good we're gonna do a hug wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=961.3s	961.3	 Oops get down almost ready hugs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=969.9s	969.9	 I'm gonna do another lap of the store. Another thing that I love about training in places like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=974.1s	974.1	 Is that it gives us so many opportunities to practice our real life leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=983.6s	983.6	 Come that's right good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=988.0s	988.0	 This way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=989.7s	989.7	 Oh, they got a bird up there. Oh my god, what a beautiful thing. Oh, thanks. Do you want to say hi? Yeah. Yeah, sure, please
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1000.2s	1000.2	 Oh, this might be interesting it's an opportunity to practice on some new stairs inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1005.9s	1005.9	 Come here inertia still isn't very proficient at walking up and down stairs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1010.6s	1010.6	 And these stairs are extra different because they're made of metal. She's never seen that before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1015.5s	1015.5	 Do you want to come up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1018.8s	1018.8	 Thought she might follow me let me see if she'll come here she'll do it for food or she's just too nervous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1028.3s	1028.3	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1039.5s	1039.5	 Come on good girl. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1042.2s	1042.2	 Come on good girl. Yes right here. There you go. That's it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1048.6s	1048.6	 Come on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1055.9s	1055.9	 Good girl, come on. Yes. Come on get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1064.9s	1064.9	 Yes, there you go, there's the breakthrough moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1068.8s	1068.8	 Yes, there you go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1070.8s	1070.8	 That was an example of just sticking with her letting her figure it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1073.7s	1073.7	 Rather than waiting until you encounter metal stairs in real life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1077.1s	1077.1	 And then you discover that oh my dog doesn't like the metal stairs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1080.4s	1080.4	 I feel pretty good about this outing this training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1083.3s	1083.3	 This was really good for her to see a variety of new things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1087.1s	1087.1	 And to even start listening to me in a really crazy distracting environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShXoLoKDgiM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=1091.8s	1091.8	 You will not regret getting your free bark box go to bark box.com slash dog training
