https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=125.4s	125.4	 Well, I've been doing it for a little over a year and I just love to spend time with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=129.3s	129.3	 the dogs and just to do anything I can to help them out and to just be a better example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 for people around town.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 Why did you decide to get another dog right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 Well, when I met Deuce, I just fell in love with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=140.4s	140.4	 Sadie loves dogs and I just thought she could have a friend in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 She's very amped up, isn't she?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 We have Deuce here, your new dog, who's just hanging out and he's very chill right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=150.4s	150.4	 Deuce and your current dog, Sadie, have met briefly at the shelter and they played for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=155.6s	155.6	 I do have some concerns because when they were playing, Sadie was coming on a bit strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 and Deuce had to say, yo, back off, man, that's a little bit too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 And so I want to make sure that that situation doesn't accelerate and that they kind of know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=169.3s	169.3	 how to interact with one another without communicating in such a forceful way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 The key is going to be going slow and really easing both dogs into the new situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=177.8s	177.8	 The biggest thing you can do to throw a dog off is change their environment or change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=181.9s	181.9	 a major variable in their environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=183.9s	183.9	 There's obviously a lot of variables when it comes to introducing two new dogs and every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=188.1s	188.1	 situation is really unique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=190.2s	190.2	 But today I hope to give you some general guidelines on things to keep in mind in order
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=193.4s	193.4	 to ensure a smooth transition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=195.4s	195.4	 Ideally, it's best that you screen any potential new dog to make sure that they're generally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=200.1s	200.1	 good with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=201.3s	201.3	 But even if you do this, this is no guarantee that they're still going to get along with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=205.1s	205.1	 your individual dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=206.7s	206.7	 Now we'll be paying particular attention to both dogs' body language and that can tell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=210.2s	210.2	 you an awful lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 Both Sadie and Deuce have a lot of energy and it can be very risky introducing two dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 with a lot of energy that have not been exercised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=218.7s	218.7	 Now since neither dog knows fetch yet, that's my preferred way to exercise a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=223.2s	223.2	 We're going to have to settle for taking them on a walk to get some of that energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 You would not necessarily accomplish getting two dogs comfortable with one another in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=231.2s	231.2	 single training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=232.7s	232.7	 So the advice I'm going to give you today is something that you should implement over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=235.9s	235.9	 the next seven to fourteen days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=237.8s	237.8	 Though it can be months with some dogs or it can be an afternoon with others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=241.4s	241.4	 My general game plan today is to break this training session up into three major components.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=245.5s	245.5	 First we want to get the dogs comfortable just being around each other in an area that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=249.4s	249.4	 neither one really identifies as their house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 So for example, a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=253.3s	253.3	 Then we want to encourage some minimal interaction maybe after the walk is over and finally we'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=257.8s	257.8	 get them comfortable hopefully fingers crossed being comfortable with each other inside the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=261.6s	261.6	 house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=262.6s	262.6	 And you also have a cat named Mika.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 That's a big wild card here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 We don't know how Deuce is going to do with cats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=267.9s	267.9	 We've never seen him with cats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=269.3s	269.3	 Our goal will be to introduce Deuce and Mika your cat and hopefully that goes well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=284.6s	284.6	 Everything is going as expected so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=286.8s	286.8	 We have Sadie who's kind of glancing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=288.8s	288.8	 She's pulling on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=289.8s	289.8	 That just means she's got a lot of energy in her right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=292.4s	292.4	 That's to be expected with a high energy dog like her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=295.2s	295.2	 This is interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 Deuce just gave his longest look yet to Sadie and you know he's just taking it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=300.6s	300.6	 They're able to assess a lot about one another believe it or not through all of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=305.3s	305.3	 Dogs have their own way of communicating and understanding one another in a way that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=308.1s	308.1	 can't understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 And when I'm looking at Sadie I can see that she's a lot more eager to interact with Deuce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=313.5s	313.5	 Our next step is to make sure that we can get their attention on us so we have better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=317.4s	317.4	 control should they get out of hand later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=319.3s	319.3	 Basically, it's like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 You know, sit, look at the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 It's up here at my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 Good dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=324.4s	324.4	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=325.4s	325.4	 Now we're going to phase out the treat and it's hey, up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 No treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=330.0s	330.0	 Got his attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=332.0s	332.0	 And I'm not going to reward separately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=334.8s	334.8	 If you guys need a more detailed lesson on how to teach your dog to look at you, I'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=338.3s	338.3	 have a video in the description that will tell you everything you need to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=342.5s	342.5	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=344.1s	344.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=345.4s	345.4	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=345.9s	345.9	 And notice, they're not looking at a treat right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 They're being attentive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=348.6s	348.6	 And I'm ready to proceed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=349.6s	349.6	 But we just want to prepare them for what we're going to ask them to do later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=352.7s	352.7	 So it's not such a foreign concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=354.6s	354.6	 By taking small steps you're more likely to ensure success when you're teaching your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=359.2s	359.2	 You're doing fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=360.2s	360.2	 Deuce, you are a rock star, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=362.2s	362.2	 Our next step is to get them comfortable walking past one another and then we're going to encourage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=366.4s	366.4	 some minimal interaction and then we'll take it to the next level and see if we can get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=370.0s	370.0	 them playing together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=371.0s	371.0	 The goal here is to see how they react as they walk past one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=374.5s	374.5	 You can see Sadie is looking at Deuce over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=376.8s	376.8	 Deuce looking over at Sadie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=378.4s	378.4	 That was a very, very good look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=379.9s	379.9	 He just glanced at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=381.4s	381.4	 That's all very normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=382.4s	382.4	 That's what we're hoping to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=383.8s	383.8	 If you had one dog trying to get at the other, if they're really excited and trying to play,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=388.2s	388.2	 that probably means that they're not thoroughly exercised enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=390.5s	390.5	 So I'd recommend that you take a step back and get the more energetic dog tired before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=396.0s	396.0	 doing this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 Now you can see she's getting excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=400.0s	400.0	 This is a sign that he's comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 Deuce right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=403.0s	403.0	 He's going on his back and he's rolling around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=404.5s	404.5	 He's feeling good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=405.5s	405.5	 She recognizes that Sadie as a sign of play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=408.4s	408.4	 She's getting in a playful move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=409.5s	409.5	 Biting on the leash is pretty typical for a dog that wants to play right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=413.3s	413.3	 So this is a good sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=414.3s	414.3	 I think they might be primed right now to kind of sniff each other and say hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=417.3s	417.3	 What do you say we encourage them to just keep the leashes nice and loose here and keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=422.7s	422.7	 that leash loose?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=425.7s	425.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=426.7s	426.7	 Now go pull.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=427.7s	427.7	 Don't pull her back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=428.7s	428.7	 Just yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=430.4s	430.4	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=431.4s	431.4	 Let's pull her back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=432.4s	432.4	 See?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=433.4s	433.4	 And so those are the kind of things that's very normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=434.4s	434.4	 Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=435.4s	435.4	 No ma'am.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=436.4s	436.4	 Excuse me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=437.4s	437.4	 Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=438.4s	438.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=439.4s	439.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=440.4s	440.4	 It is common for a lot of dogs to behave that way when on leash more than off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=442.9s	442.9	 We can play it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=443.9s	443.9	 Yeah, if you can pull that up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=444.9s	444.9	 I just want to analyze that before we move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=446.3s	446.3	 Let's take a look at this and see what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=448.1s	448.1	 Everything is going well until right about here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=450.6s	450.6	 This is where you see Sadie's hair raise, her tail stops wagging, and her overall demeanor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=454.7s	454.7	 becomes a bit more guarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=456.5s	456.5	 And keep that leash loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=457.6s	457.6	 The reason I like to see a loose leash in this situation is that a tight leash when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=460.7s	460.7	 greeting another dog might encourage a feeling of defensiveness as a dog is reminded that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=465.3s	465.3	 he or she is restrained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=466.9s	466.9	 It's really clear that Sadie took exception to Deuce greeting her here as he made his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=470.6s	470.6	 way to her rear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 This is her way to say, I don't mind getting to know you, but we're not at the point where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=475.5s	475.5	 I'm comfortable with you checking me out unconditionally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=478.4s	478.4	 Perhaps very encouraging is that after the scuffle, Deuce immediately looks to Sarah for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=482.9s	482.9	 direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=483.9s	483.9	 That's a good sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=485.2s	485.2	 Because the body language of both dogs instantly returns to that which would suggest being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=488.8s	488.8	 in a playful mood, and because Sadie is almost instantly receptive to training as I ask her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=493.5s	493.5	 to sit, this tells me that this is likely not serious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=496.6s	496.6	 So obviously we had a little bit of an unpleasant reaction there with Sadie and Deuce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=500.4s	500.4	 It's not very abnormal at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=502.0s	502.0	 Many of you have dealt with this at home, but when that happens, that's your cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=505.5s	505.5	 Take a step back, ease them into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=507.2s	507.2	 I don't think this is that serious, so I'm going to encourage the dogs to play together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=510.7s	510.7	 off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=511.7s	511.7	 However, if this happens with your dogs, you may want to consider bringing in a positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=515.8s	515.8	 trainer with good credentials.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=517.4s	517.4	 Remember, always make sure that your trainer is up to date on the latest science and ethics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=522.7s	522.7	 in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=527.9s	527.9	 So now we're in the backyard with Sadie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=529.6s	529.6	 We're going to bring Deuce back out in a second, but I kind of want to have her play a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=532.9s	532.9	 bit more, get a little bit more energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=535.1s	535.1	 I think we're going to be in a better situation now if both dogs are off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=539.1s	539.1	 The reason that in this specific situation, I think having both dogs off leash is likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=543.7s	543.7	 to make things better is because they don't feel as restrained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=547.1s	547.1	 They can act more naturally with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=549.6s	549.6	 It's worth noting that when you introduce dogs to each other, that you pick up all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=552.6s	552.6	 toys, all the things that one dog is likely to be more possessive over, so you can avoid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=557.0s	557.0	 that potential conflict from the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=561.3s	561.3	 There's the hair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=562.3s	562.3	 So call Sadie back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=563.3s	563.3	 Sadie!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=564.3s	564.3	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=565.3s	565.3	 She's defused now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=566.3s	566.3	 Her hair got a little up there, but those are the little things we want to look for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=568.9s	568.9	 Okay, go ahead and let's let them talk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=571.2s	571.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=572.2s	572.2	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=573.2s	573.2	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=574.2s	574.2	 That's what I want to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=576.0s	576.0	 This is all play on Sadie's part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=577.7s	577.7	 This is good behavior right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=579.1s	579.1	 During these initial stages of having the dogs interact, they're doing really well right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=582.6s	582.6	 now, but you might want to avoid being in the middle of them giving too much attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=586.0s	586.0	 to one dog over the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=587.8s	587.8	 That could also cause one dog to be a little bit more protective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=591.4s	591.4	 So if you notice that when you're trying to introduce a new dog to your current dog, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=594.7s	594.7	 they're not immediately interacting, that's also okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=597.1s	597.1	 Not all dogs want to burst into play immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=599.4s	599.4	 Everything's going pretty smoothly back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=600.7s	600.7	 I think we're ready to move on to our final step, which is getting the dogs comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=604.0s	604.0	 with being near each other while inside the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=607.5s	607.5	 In general, this is the most challenging part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=609.6s	609.6	 Imagine a new person moving into your house and how that might affect you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=613.1s	613.1	 To be ultra clear, it's best to make sure that the dogs have met outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=617.0s	617.0	 If either dog is moderate to high energy, make sure that they are well exercised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=621.7s	621.7	 This is strongly advised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=623.7s	623.7	 As things do get out of hand, break the dogs up, get their attention on you, and then allow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=627.7s	627.7	 them to start playing again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=629.4s	629.4	 As you can see, these guys are going to be buddies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=631.4s	631.4	 But there is one more thing we still need to address.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=633.5s	633.5	 But you have one more variable that's quite interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=636.8s	636.8	 You have a cat, Mika.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=639.2s	639.2	 And we have no idea how he's going to react with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=641.9s	641.9	 What I'd like to do is bring down Mika and just kind of see how he acts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=644.6s	644.6	 We're going to keep him on leash because we don't know if he's likely to chase the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=646.9s	646.9	 cat or if he's likely to be like, I don't care about cats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=649.5s	649.5	 Some dogs are like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=651.0s	651.0	 So why don't you go get Mika and we'll see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=653.3s	653.3	 You'll want to introduce your new dog to one new pet at a time as to avoid overwhelming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=657.5s	657.5	 him or her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=658.5s	658.5	 What I'm trying to do right now is I'm trying to get Deuce to listen to me in the presence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=662.6s	662.6	 of Mika over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=663.6s	663.6	 You can see he's really interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=665.4s	665.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=667.4s	667.4	 But good, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=669.1s	669.1	 Very nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=670.1s	670.1	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=671.1s	671.1	 And you want to do this under very controlled circumstances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=673.1s	673.1	 Now remember though, every dog, every cat is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=676.0s	676.0	 So you'll want to use discretion based on your situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=678.9s	678.9	 We're not dying to have Mika and Deuce interact with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=681.5s	681.5	 Right now, the goal is simply to get him comfortable in the presence of her and to get him paying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=685.7s	685.7	 attention to me while in the presence of Mika.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=688.4s	688.4	 I mean, I'd like her on the ground, but I don't want them interacting just yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=692.7s	692.7	 I don't want to rush them into that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=694.3s	694.3	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=695.3s	695.3	 Sit and see right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=696.3s	696.3	 Now that she's on the ground, he's much more interested in her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=699.5s	699.5	 See how he's not taking the treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=701.8s	701.8	 That means we're asking him to do too much right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=705.2s	705.2	 You know what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=706.2s	706.2	 So if that was you, what you would want to do is you would want to take some more time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=709.1s	709.1	 to get your dog comfortable just being in the same room with your cat, but not have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=713.0s	713.0	 direct access to your cat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=715.2s	715.2	 In the description, I'll have a video on how to teach your dog to leave your cat alone,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=723.2s	723.2	 You want to be very conservative and take your time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=725.7s	725.7	 Guys, listen, there's nothing wrong with taking days, weeks, or even months to introduce your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=733.4s	733.4	 Don't feel like you have to rush it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXNXbg9qDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=734.8s	734.8	 I think you're doing fantastic.
