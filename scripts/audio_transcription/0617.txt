https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=3.8s	3.8	 Tell me in the comments below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=9.3s	9.3	 When people are new to training a dog, they often tell me my dog listens to me, but only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=13.3s	13.3	 if I have a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 In this video, I'm going to attempt to give you some tips as to how to get your dog to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=18.1s	18.1	 listen to you without a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 The first mistake to avoid is assuming that just because your dog does a behavior for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 a treat, that they now know it and you don't need to use treats anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=27.8s	27.8	 Now, if your dog doesn't listen to you without a treat, it's not a sign of them being stubborn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=31.8s	31.8	 it just means they haven't internalized the behavior yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=34.8s	34.8	 We have to continue to provide motivation to our dogs for an extended period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=39.1s	39.1	 before we wean them off of treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=41.2s	41.2	 This means spending many cumulative hours with them over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 Basic obedience is more habitual than anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 It's better to establish consistent patterns of success than it is to try and hurry up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=51.3s	51.3	 and cut the cord on treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=53.1s	53.1	 Before you even think about weaning your dog off of treats, it's important that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 consistently rewarding them on at least two to three behaviors that they already know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=60.2s	60.2	 very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=61.2s	61.2	 So I've got Venus with me here today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=62.9s	62.9	 Now, the first thing you want to do is you want to make sure that you have taught sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 very good and that you're rewarding very consistently on sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=70.7s	70.7	 When I use food when teaching dogs, I like to use something really good like turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=74.1s	74.1	 The second thing people generally teach obedience-wise anyway is lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 So once your dog is lying down consistently and you're rewarding consistently, it's time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 to combine two behaviors at one time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 Sit, first I'm going to treat on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 Lie down, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 So I'm going to reward on lie down as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=91.9s	91.9	 The next thing you want to do is start to ask for two behaviors in a row like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=96.8s	96.8	 Sit, lie down, then reward and I even give them an extra big reward the first several
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=101.7s	101.7	 times they do that as if to say, I'll pay you for both, but I want you to do them both
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 in advance first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=107.3s	107.3	 Repeat that lots of times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 Get them really comfortable doing that, doing two behaviors in a row for a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=113.1s	113.1	 And remember, you don't always have to use food as a reward as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 In fact, in my last video I showed you how to use play as a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=119.1s	119.1	 The same concept applies and if you have a high energy dog, this might be a better way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 to teach them anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 Venus, sit, lie down, play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=126.6s	126.6	 Good, now she's doing three in a row.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 Excellent job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=132.1s	132.1	 So I'll reward every third trick, but sometimes to keep it interesting, I might just say Venus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 sit and keep her guessing and reward on sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=138.1s	138.1	 Always keep your dog guessing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 Keep it fun for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 Anytime you're asking your dog to do something that you think they already know how to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=143.1s	143.1	 without a reward in an environment that they're not familiar with, be prepared to reteach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 it a little bit in that environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=149.8s	149.8	 Dogs are really sensitive to new changes in their surroundings, so be very understanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=154.1s	154.1	 of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=155.1s	155.1	 Venus, sit, wave, sippity, lie down, get up, speak, good, stand, walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 Oh, look at that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=165.2s	165.2	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 Excellent job, Venus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=167.2s	167.2	 You look excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 And that was all for one reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=169.9s	169.9	 Bottom line, you don't just go from treats to no treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=172.7s	172.7	 You just ask for a little bit more as your dog progresses in their training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=176.8s	176.8	 You'll notice over time that you don't really need to use rewards anymore, that your relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 is such that your dog chooses to listen to you because you create a good environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=186.2s	186.2	 for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=187.2s	187.2	 Sit, lie down, get up, sippity, speak.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=618&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 kind of say thank you.
