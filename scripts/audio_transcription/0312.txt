https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=255.4s	255.4	 Here you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=257.3s	257.3	 I think that's a yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 Just like with the toys, different textures can come invaluable for lots of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 Whether it's just to give your dog a snack or because they prefer a different texture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=266.8s	266.8	 So these piggy puffs right here have that like pork rind texture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 Here you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=271.5s	271.5	 These are all natural.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=272.4s	272.4	 They're grain free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=273.5s	273.5	 Let's see if she'll sit for a piggy puff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=275.9s	275.9	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=277.5s	277.5	 It works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 That's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=279.3s	279.3	 If your dog needs more of a challenge than the toys and bark box,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=282.1s	282.1	 you're definitely going to want to check out the super chewer box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=284.7s	284.7	 If you're not familiar with the super chewer box, your mind is about to be blown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=288.6s	288.6	 Tell me about Tahoe's personality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=290.4s	290.4	 He likes to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 He loves to chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=293.3s	293.3	 That's his favorite thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=294.8s	294.8	 He chews everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=296.3s	296.3	 I have to keep a lot of chew toys and phones and really strong toys for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=300.8s	300.8	 He has some really strong jaws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=302.9s	302.9	 The soft ones, he'll just tear apart really easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=305.9s	305.9	 The super chewer boxes are from the bark team,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=308.3s	308.3	 but they're completely different than the bark boxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=310.7s	310.7	 As you can tell by the name, these boxes are filled with items designed for really tough dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=315.1s	315.1	 that demand more of a challenge with their toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=317.7s	317.7	 The themes of super chewer boxes are focused on giving strong dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=320.8s	320.8	 the physical and mental outlet they really need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 Let's check out this box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=325.3s	325.3	 Big game fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=326.5s	326.5	 Oh, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=327.3s	327.3	 And it's a football theme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=328.9s	328.9	 Those are like my two favorite things in life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=331.1s	331.1	 Fetch with dogs and football.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=333.2s	333.2	 I got a good feeling about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=334.8s	334.8	 Looks like Tahoe's ready to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=336.3s	336.3	 So this whooshes when you throw it and close in the dark too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=339.8s	339.8	 I think Tahoe's definitely ready, but I mean that, that is a hard toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=344.9s	344.9	 Okay, you're Edelman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=346.1s	346.1	 I'm Brady.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=347.1s	347.1	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=350.0s	350.0	 Touchdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=351.5s	351.5	 Wait, catch it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=353.4s	353.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=354.1s	354.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=355.3s	355.3	 Hey, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=356.4s	356.4	 False start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=358.4s	358.4	 That's what he thinks of that penalty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=360.3s	360.3	 This is made of ballistic nylon, and if you need any more evidence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=364.1s	364.1	 that this is one of the toughest tug toys you can get, check out Tahoe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=368.5s	368.5	 Look at him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=369.5s	369.5	 Let's play tug with the other end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=371.4s	371.4	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=372.8s	372.8	 So he can really grip it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=374.0s	374.0	 He doesn't have to hold back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=375.5s	375.5	 You don't have to worry about this toy getting ruined with a dog like Tahoe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=379.7s	379.7	 You're free to play with them at their fullest potential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 So you have this like heavy textured ball right here, and it even squeaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=387.7s	387.7	 I mean you have to, it takes two hands to squeak it if you're a weak human like me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=392.9s	392.9	 It's not just small dogs that like squeaky toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=395.3s	395.3	 Big dogs like them too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=396.3s	396.3	 But something tells me you could really squeak that if you wanted it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 So fighting a squeaky toy that's also durable is a hard thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=403.4s	403.4	 Super Chewer has done it though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=405.1s	405.1	 Squeaks like that can keep a dog really engaged in a toy, which keeps them engaged with you and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=410.8s	410.8	 just helps their overall quality of life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=413.2s	413.2	 All right, I think he's ready for a toss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=414.7s	414.7	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=416.5s	416.5	 All right, let go and go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=419.9s	419.9	 Easy to throw up far too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=421.9s	421.9	 Good job Tahoe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=423.8s	423.8	 These are pigs in a blanket right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=425.6s	425.6	 And so the Super Chewer treats, you really get to see the texture of them up front here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=430.0s	430.0	 From chewy to crunchy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=431.6s	431.6	 These are more chewy than crunchy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=433.3s	433.3	 And again, just as with the Bark Box treats, these are going to be really high quality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=437.3s	437.3	 ingredients as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=438.6s	438.6	 Because I don't know if you guys have looked at ingredients on dog treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=441.1s	441.1	 They're not usually very high quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=443.5s	443.5	 This has things like pork, chickpeas, and kale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=446.0s	446.0	 But look, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=446.7s	446.7	 They have filling inside of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=449.3s	449.3	 And so here are the pig skin puffs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=451.1s	451.1	 And you can see these are going to be crunchy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=456.0s	456.0	 I think I heard one crunch in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=460.3s	460.3	 You're such a trip buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=461.8s	461.8	 You're so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=463.5s	463.5	 Another differentiator with the Super Chewer Box is it comes with two different chews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=467.8s	467.8	 Because we'll give these to you at another time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=471.9s	471.9	 Because we have another box to go through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=473.5s	473.5	 I don't want you filling up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=474.8s	474.8	 This box is all about treat dispensing toys to give your dog that mental workout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=479.0s	479.0	 So whereas the other box was really fetch themed, this is more mentally themed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=483.6s	483.6	 This is a Puckle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=484.7s	484.7	 The first thing I notice about this toy is how heavy it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=488.2s	488.2	 I mean, I wish there was a way to articulate this to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=490.3s	490.3	 But it's much heavier than you would expect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=492.9s	492.9	 And that's going to be good for obvious reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=495.8s	495.8	 This is supposed to squeak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=499.1s	499.1	 Oh, it does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=500.3s	500.3	 That might be the toughest squeaky toy I've ever encountered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=505.2s	505.2	 And see, check out that wobbly shape right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=507.7s	507.7	 Things that move kind of unpredictably can be really exciting to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=511.5s	511.5	 If you've ever seen durable dog toys in the past, some of them might actually be durable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=516.3s	516.3	 But they're almost never exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=518.4s	518.4	 Super Chewer toys are completely different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=520.7s	520.7	 Every one of the toys they send is actually really interactive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=523.9s	523.9	 And it's got these little holes right here where I can stick treats that are that make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=527.2s	527.2	 it kind of challenging for Tahoe to get them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=529.9s	529.9	 These are boring banana treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=531.5s	531.5	 They are chewy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=532.7s	532.7	 Let's open these and put them in our Puckle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=536.8s	536.8	 That is a sentence I never thought I would say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=539.7s	539.7	 So you can see here, this is going to be more challenging to get out right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=543.2s	543.2	 Here you go, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=544.1s	544.1	 Let's see how challenging this is for Tahoe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=546.6s	546.6	 So you can tell there's treats in there and see his tendency is to grab the whole thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=550.5s	550.5	 But look at him using his brain there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=552.1s	552.1	 If your dog is the type who really likes to be rough with toys, who's really energetic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=556.7s	556.7	 they really need more mental and physical stimulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=559.2s	559.2	 And so while it can be a puzzle toy, it also doubles as an amazing fetch toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=565.0s	565.0	 Boom, look at that bounce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=567.7s	567.7	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=568.2s	568.2	 He doesn't know if he should eat it or fetch it there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=570.1s	570.1	 but he figured it out because he's a brilliant dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=572.6s	572.6	 Here's a big tooth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=573.7s	573.7	 There is more to this toy than you might realize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=575.5s	575.5	 They even give you instructions right here if you want an overview as to how it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=580.3s	580.3	 So look, you can pull this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=581.7s	581.7	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=582.1s	582.1	 But it's not hard or easy to pull out, really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=585.1s	585.1	 You could put peanut butter inside the orange part here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=587.5s	587.5	 Puzzle toys are great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=588.5s	588.5	 And when dogs use their brains for puzzles or training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=591.1s	591.1	 it can work as well as exercise to satisfy them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=593.8s	593.8	 And again, we're talking about very, very durable materials here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=597.3s	597.3	 So then you close it like this and you can actually change the difficulty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=602.5s	602.5	 If you have just a little bit exposed, it makes it a little bit more challenging to get to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=606.7s	606.7	 And then if you want to make it a little bit easier for your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=608.8s	608.8	 especially in the beginning, you might make it a little bit bigger like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=612.3s	612.3	 So you can put like treats right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=614.6s	614.6	 So it's quite clever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=616.4s	616.4	 Dare I say genius.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=618.1s	618.1	 This is called a Brumpy right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=619.9s	619.9	 Now this, check this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=622.1s	622.1	 They really pay attention to details with these bark toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=625.2s	625.2	 So you have this uneven texture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=626.7s	626.7	 So as your dog licks this and plays with it, it's going to wobble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=629.6s	629.6	 It's going to continue to bring that motion to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=632.1s	632.1	 And you can put peanut butter right here in between these grooves,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=635.7s	635.7	 which will increase their interest over an extended period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=638.9s	638.9	 Again, really stimulating them mentally so that they are engaged with the product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=643.5s	643.5	 By the way, dishwasher safe too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=646.0s	646.0	 Oh, he's discovered the peanut butter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=650.5s	650.5	 Do you hear him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=652.6s	652.6	 That's what a happy dog sounds like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=654.7s	654.7	 And again, we're talking ultra durable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=657.2s	657.2	 I mean, that thing, that's durable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=660.2s	660.2	 I'd like to see you try to destroy this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=662.6s	662.6	 Check these out on the Chewy to Crunchy scale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=665.0s	665.0	 Lamb and papaya.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=666.7s	666.7	 Check it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=669.4s	669.4	 And you get two more chews in this box as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=672.4s	672.4	 Just like with BarkBox, there are options for dogs with allergies or special dietary needs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=677.0s	677.0	 SuperChewer can even send you an all toy or all treat box if that's what your dog would prefer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=682.7s	682.7	 I love that they offer that kind of flexibility

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2comBDmC4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=313&pp=iAQB&t=688.9s	688.9	 If you want to give either of these boxes a shot,
