https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 Today, I'm gonna show you how to teach your dog to come to you reliably and for the rest of his life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 Hopefully. And if you want the complete dog training experience, pick up a copy of my book on Amazon, Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=22.4s	22.4	 It's only like ten bucks. I mean, that's a lot cheaper than replacing your chewed up furniture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 Just saying. These things are so popular and it's for good reason too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=30.8s	30.8	 Our dog, Indiana, used to have like the worst breath and we started giving her these greenies and she loves them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=36.3s	36.3	 And I love the fact that she doesn't have bad breath anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=38.9s	38.9	 If you've got a puppy or you want to give your dog something to do when you're busy and you want to get rid of the bad breath at the same time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 make sure you've got a great supply of greenies dental treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 You only need to give these to your dog once a day and their breath will stay fresh all day long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 Plus, it's really healthy for their teeth and gums too. So good for puppies who are teething.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=55.2s	55.2	 Take the whole bag. Greenies dental treats have this really great chewy texture so that when dogs chew them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=60.7s	60.7	 they can really sink their teeth into them all the way up to their gums.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 And that helps scrape away plaque and tartar basically the same way your toothbrush does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 They're safe, nutritious and made with high level protein. So they taste great and they're easy to digest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=73.1s	73.1	 There's even a grain free option too. Chestnut loves the grain free ones. And they're all made in the USA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 I'm going to have a link in the description so that you can get yours at Pet Flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=81.5s	81.5	 Chestnut, your breath smells so much better now. Let's get to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 Chestnut's only 12 weeks old. And you know, there are some advantages to teaching a younger dog that's under four months or so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=90.2s	90.2	 to come to you when you call them relative to an older dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 That's because dogs this young like to stay close to you more than they might when they get just a little bit older.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 So take advantage of that. Also, they probably haven't really formed the habit of running away from you yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=102.3s	102.3	 Let's keep it that way. This is a really good time to convince them that coming to you always results in great things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=109.3s	109.3	 The first rule of teaching your puppy to reliably come to you is to make sure they're never in a position to disregard your request.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 So how do we do that? We control their environment at all times during the first year of training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=120.7s	120.7	 which means you should be able to get to your puppy 100% of the time, even if that means attaching the leash to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 You can't run away because I have you on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=129.8s	129.8	 Notice that Chestnut is on leash right now, even though I'm inside so that I can easily get to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=135.3s	135.3	 I'm going to have a video in the description that will give you an overview of how to adequately control your dog's environment at all times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 If you've accidentally slipped up on sufficiently controlling your dog's environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=144.2s	144.2	 you might find yourself in a position where your dog can get away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 If your dog gets away from you, it's your fault, not theirs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Just do everything you can to keep it from happening again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=152.3s	152.3	 It's for their own long term well-being and safety that we do this right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=156.4s	156.4	 First, you're going to want to reliably teach your dog how to come to you while inside your house under relatively distraction free circumstances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 Make sure that you're using a treat that your dog absolutely loves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 Today I'm using dehydrated turkey treats, but you can use something like boiled chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 I bet your dog would love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=172.7s	172.7	 First, you'll need to confirm that your dog will sit or lie down or whatever they're good at for a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 See, that indicates that they're not too heavily distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 Now, if they were too distracted to take an amazing treat that they normally love,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 that most likely means you're asking them to do too much too soon or under circumstances that are too distracting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=190.5s	190.5	 Chestnut's a pretty happy dog overall, and I think there's a great chance that he's going to come to me if I just act fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=196.4s	196.4	 Let's find out. Come on, Chestnut. Come on. Come on. Good. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=199.9s	199.9	 Oh, you're so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=201.6s	201.6	 Try using a high pitched inviting voice and even use a toy that they really love to entice them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=206.8s	206.8	 You know, squeaky toys can be really great for this because they make that fun sound that most puppies can't resist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=212.7s	212.7	 And if you're feeling like it, be really animated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=214.9s	214.9	 Now, if your dog were a little bit more nervous, you would want to be a bit more low key when you do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 Even if you've got to teach your dog to come to you at this short distance, that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 Come on, even if they crawl to get to you, I'll take that too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 Oh, that's excellent, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=227.6s	227.6	 You'll find that getting down to your dog's level like this should also help tremendously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=231.8s	231.8	 Dogs are more likely to come to you when they can easily see your face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=238.2s	238.2	 There you go. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 Oh, look at that. He's so polite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=241.7s	241.7	 You're acting more like an English cocker spaniel than an American one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=245.3s	245.3	 You know, they're polite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 And there's no better way to really get your dog super enthused about listening to you and coming to you when you call them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=253.2s	253.2	 than to get them playing with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=254.7s	254.7	 That really is the secret if your dog is the type that enjoys playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=258.5s	258.5	 Of course, not all dogs enjoy playing with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=260.8s	260.8	 So that's why using a really good food reward can get you there as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=264.8s	264.8	 It just depends on you and your dog's personality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 A moment ago, when I was using treats to get Chestnut to come to me, he was walking very nicely to me and that was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=273.2s	273.2	 But now, if he sees this toy, he comes running to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=276.7s	276.7	 So use what really makes your dog excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=279.8s	279.8	 Now look, there's going to be times when you call your dog and they don't come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=283.4s	283.4	 And that's pretty normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=284.3s	284.3	 But even if you find yourself discouraged, always keep your tone somewhere between neutral to upbeat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=290.2s	290.2	 Even if you're busy or even upset a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 Who could ever get upset with you though?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=294.9s	294.9	 As your dog starts coming to you, say something like, come here, so that they begin to understand what come here means like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=301.9s	301.9	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 Come here. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=305.7s	305.7	 Yes, come here. That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=307.9s	307.9	 So Chestnut's doing pretty well right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=309.7s	309.7	 But what would I do if he wasn't really into the toys or I couldn't motivate him to run towards me because I had a treat, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=315.9s	315.9	 In that case, try luring your dog with an exceptional treat like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=320.9s	320.9	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=322.5s	322.5	 What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=324.4s	324.4	 Over here. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=326.1s	326.1	 Sometimes you just have to make it really, really easy for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=329.9s	329.9	 Nice job. That was excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=332.2s	332.2	 The farther away that your puppy is from you, the more challenging you might find it is to get them to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=337.4s	337.4	 Shorten the distance if necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=339.2s	339.2	 In early training, dogs require a smaller training bubble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=342.7s	342.7	 Sometimes you just have to make it extra easy for your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=345.5s	345.5	 Then either lure them or better yet, see if they're feeling peppy enough to chase you once you get their attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=350.6s	350.6	 Puppies love to chase and this gets them enthused about running to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=354.5s	354.5	 Chestnut?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=355.4s	355.4	 So Chestnut's not responding to me right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=357.5s	357.5	 You see that? I'm calling him.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=390.2s	390.2	 Look at that. See that?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=398.2s	398.2	 In this case, 12 weeks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=412.7s	412.7	 If your dog comes to you and you haven't asked them to,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=434.2s	434.2	 like when it's dark, when there are fireworks or exciting animals around,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=447.2s	447.2	 resist the temptation to phase out rewards too quickly in exciting places.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=476.2s	476.2	 Teaching your dog to come to you is one half of the equation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvY1fYxKFJU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=454&pp=iAQB&t=478.7s	478.7	 The other half is showing them this new world that they're living in
