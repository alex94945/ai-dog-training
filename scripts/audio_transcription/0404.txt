https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 When you set up automatic pet food delivery at PepFlo, you're helping us to fund our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 production and you're also making your life a lot easier as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 That's because PepFlo will automatically ship your dog food straight to your front door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=18.1s	18.1	 All you do is choose your favorite brand of food and tell them how often you want it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 Maybe you want it delivered every two weeks, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=24.7s	24.7	 It'll just be there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=25.8s	25.8	 So there's nothing more annoying than having to run out and get food at the last second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=29.5s	29.5	 when you realize that you're out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=30.9s	30.9	 Enter code ZACH30 when you check out and you'll get $10 off your first three auto ship orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=35.4s	35.4	 I'll have that link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 Recently, YouTube subscriber Jeremy brought Cali, the four month old Aussie, to hang out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=40.7s	40.7	 for a little while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=41.8s	41.8	 And like many of you, Jeremy is new to teaching dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 These guys are off to a great start and Jeremy had some great questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=47.5s	47.5	 That's the first time she's ever done that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 I couldn't get her to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=50.8s	50.8	 How's her training been going?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 I mean, we definitely have our things we're really trying to work on, like walks and she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=56.2s	56.2	 tries to pick up everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=57.7s	57.7	 She tries to greet every dog, every person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=60.5s	60.5	 She wants to greet everybody like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=62.8s	62.8	 I have lots of questions written down on my phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=65.5s	65.5	 Excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 And I'm also going to give you a copy of my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=67.8s	67.8	 I bought your book already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 Oh, you did?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=69.8s	69.8	 I've watched a good amount of your videos and one of the things you talk about on your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 leash walking is doing the look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 And again, that's hard with her outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=79.1s	79.1	 You're taking a step that's too big, it sounds like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=81.2s	81.2	 So you're taking it from inside to on the walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=83.4s	83.4	 There's steps in between that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=85.4s	85.4	 Outside the front door, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=87.1s	87.1	 Practicing look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=88.1s	88.1	 I mean, it gets meticulous there those first few months of training or at the front door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 when she's excited before you need to find the point where look at me breaks down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=96.5s	96.5	 Where does it go from reliable to unreliable?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 Because there is that point in space, whether it's right outside the threshold or right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 inside the threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 And you have to get it fine there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 Now the good news is once you start to get traction, you don't have to stay and take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=111.2s	111.2	 those tiny steps forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=112.8s	112.8	 But in the beginning, the steps are tiny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=115.2s	115.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=117.1s	117.1	 You can spend at least two days a week or more if you can for three hour periods at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 the park outside just to let her exist in those environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=125.4s	125.4	 Those environments are then going to become normal to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 But when she's spending, say, I don't know, 60, 70% of her time in your house, which I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 guess is probably accurate maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=133.7s	133.7	 And the park is like, I only see that every once in a while, even if it's for 20 minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=138.5s	138.5	 a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=139.5s	139.5	 So spending hours at a time outside is what you need to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=142.6s	142.6	 Her look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=143.6s	143.6	 You see I keep doing look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=144.9s	144.9	 I'm trying to burn that into her brain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=146.1s	146.1	 Are you prioritizing look at me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 She can't do it on walks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=148.9s	148.9	 Oh, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=149.9s	149.9	 She'll do it inside the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=150.9s	150.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 That makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 And also getting her to take a treat on walks can be difficult, even chicken or cheese.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 That makes sense too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 The reason for that is the environment is so overstimulating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 So you have to go through this period of just being tolerant and letting them explore the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=166.1s	166.1	 world and not listen to you on walks and just take it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 Because there's no substitute for just experiencing the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 That's why I say it takes a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=174.2s	174.2	 I mean, in current dog training culture, you know, they've succeeded in making you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=179.1s	179.1	 a dog can be trained in three weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=180.9s	180.9	 But there's no way to fast forward time and experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=183.7s	183.7	 I wouldn't do serious leash training with her until you've gotten tons of the energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=187.5s	187.5	 out through fetch training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 Because it's hard for her to absorb those concepts, A, when she's got the pent up energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=193.9s	193.9	 and B, when she's in an overstimulate or a very stimulating environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=197.6s	197.6	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=199.3s	199.3	 So you should work on it and you're doing the right thing, but there are more important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 priorities than teaching her to walk nicely on a leash right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=207.2s	207.2	 When she pulls, what do I do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=208.9s	208.9	 It's a combination of trying to teach her the proper way to act and tolerating the leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=213.3s	213.3	 pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=214.6s	214.6	 Because it's highly unnatural to teach a dog to walk nicely on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=218.1s	218.1	 The reason being, they walk faster than we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=220.4s	220.4	 Is that not developing like a bad habit, do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=223.7s	223.7	 It is to a degree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=226.6s	226.6	 And it's one of those pick your battles things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=228.5s	228.5	 Like, all right, we need to focus on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=230.4s	230.4	 But it's more important that I let her explore this environment and desensitize her to these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 smells and sights so that I have the hope of getting her attention in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=238.9s	238.9	 So we tend to want to do everything right and keep no bad habits from developing, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=242.3s	242.3	 is the right attitude.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 But it's a lot of give and take with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=245.9s	245.9	 Because you can't teach them everything simultaneously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=248.7s	248.7	 You can teach a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 If you will get her tired before training walks, then you have a much better chance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 at getting her to come to you when she starts to pull ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 And it won't be quite as challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=259.5s	259.5	 But I would say the biggest thing you can do right now is go to the park and three hour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=262.9s	262.9	 chunks wherever possible and just let her play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=265.9s	265.9	 You know, for the first hour, she's going to be like, Whoa, whoa, what's all this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 By hour two, she's like, this is normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=271.6s	271.6	 I'll play tug with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 You know, I'll pay attention to you with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 I think people tend to get really overwhelmed with their dogs at this point in training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=278.4s	278.4	 because you're in the communication building phase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=280.4s	280.4	 So you're trying to do two things at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=282.4s	282.4	 You're trying to train her and also build communication with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=285.6s	285.6	 And that takes months of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=287.2s	287.2	 So are you having issues with things like chewing and other things?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=291.7s	291.7	 Lots of chewing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=292.7s	292.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=293.7s	293.7	 Chews on everything she can find, including in the house and on walks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 I mostly try to redirect her calmly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=299.7s	299.7	 By redirecting, what you're saying is you basically try and get her attention off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=303.1s	303.1	 In this case, it would be trying to get her attention off the leash over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=305.9s	305.9	 Can I see some chicken really quick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=308.9s	308.9	 This is what redirecting is, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=310.7s	310.7	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=311.9s	311.9	 Now give me a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=314.1s	314.1	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=314.8s	314.8	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 The thing about redirecting though, it's good when you do catch your dog in the act of doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 something that you don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=321.5s	321.5	 And it's really common with a puppy like this for them to seemingly constantly be doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=325.5s	325.5	 something you don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 However, you do want to make sure that you really prioritize setting up training lessons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=330.7s	330.7	 like a basic leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 Management is step one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=333.9s	333.9	 Keep the behavior from occurring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 Then training is step two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=336.9s	336.9	 So here I'm tempted to just, you know, pull the leash out of her mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=340.7s	340.7	 Instead, I'll get her attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=342.1s	342.1	 Can we get a look at me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=343.9s	343.9	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=345.9s	345.9	 Oh, beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=346.9s	346.9	 Do you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=347.9s	347.9	 We got to leave it and a look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=349.3s	349.3	 There was a piece of chicken right in front of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=351.5s	351.5	 And she looked right up at me when I asked for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=353.5s	353.5	 That's a testament to your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=354.5s	354.5	 You've been doing a good job on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=355.7s	355.7	 What are your feelings about like a pen area?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 And I know that's not a place to just like put her all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=360.9s	360.9	 Oh, important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=362.4s	362.4	 You have to have a place to control the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=364.6s	364.6	 Controlling the environment can be done, should be done primarily through the leash, but when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=367.9s	367.9	 you can't or when you're sleeping, that's what the crate's for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=370.1s	370.1	 It's what the pen area is for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=371.4s	371.4	 I even tie it like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 That's usually what I do with a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=374.4s	374.4	 In the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=375.4s	375.4	 Yeah, in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=376.4s	376.4	 Because that way you're in a position to nip bad habits in the bud and you're there to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=379.3s	379.3	 acknowledge good behaviors you like instantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=382.6s	382.6	 Is that problematic for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=383.6s	383.6	 It is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=384.6s	384.6	 No, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=385.6s	385.6	 It's hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=386.6s	386.6	 Most people don't do this, by the way, even when I recommend it because it is a chore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=390.1s	390.1	 But it's the right answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=391.9s	391.9	 Have you been working on fetch training at all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=394.9s	394.9	 I tried.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=396.4s	396.4	 I can't find, to be honest, a fetch toy that she loves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=401.5s	401.5	 She'll lose interest within five minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=403.5s	403.5	 Totally normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=404.5s	404.5	 All of this is very normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=406.8s	406.8	 Don't take that to mean that she's not interested in the toy because she has short periods of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=411.1s	411.1	 interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=412.1s	412.1	 If she has short periods of interest, you can almost certainly get her to have long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=416.2s	416.2	 periods of interest over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 It takes a moment for a dog to get hooked or addicted to this type of play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=423.1s	423.1	 It's really important that you prioritize fetch training because as time goes on, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=428.5s	428.5	 going to want to be able to get her energy out on your terms and your schedule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=432.9s	432.9	 Nothing does it like fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=434.4s	434.4	 Fetch resolves 90% of unwanted behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 Fetch starts with tug of war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=439.2s	439.2	 Tug and let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=440.2s	440.2	 And since you said she tends to lose interest, I'm trying to really keep her interested in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=443.7s	443.7	 it right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=444.7s	444.7	 I'm going to let her win and kind of actually let her take it there and everything just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=448.0s	448.0	 so she feels like she's got a victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=449.5s	449.5	 Now I'm going to go back and take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=453.1s	453.1	 Not even going to focus on let go right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=454.7s	454.7	 It's more important that she's interested in the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=459.4s	459.4	 To teach your dog to let go, all you do, it's the easiest thing in the world to take though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=463.9s	463.9	 it might take a minute with her, make the toy boring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=466.9s	466.9	 I'm just going to put it in a vice here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=469.1s	469.1	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=470.1s	470.1	 The moment she lets go, I'm going to reignite the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=472.3s	472.3	 I'm not going to put it behind my back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=473.6s	473.6	 I'm not going to ask her to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=475.1s	475.1	 I'm going to let her know when you let go, the game resumes instantly at this point in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=478.5s	478.5	 training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=479.5s	479.5	 You're probably moving forward to train more with play than you will with food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=484.5s	484.5	 Making it boring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=487.5s	487.5	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=488.5s	488.5	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=489.5s	489.5	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=490.5s	490.5	 She's used that tiny bit of restraint for just a brief moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=493.2s	493.2	 Once you perfect tug and let go, then you're ready to move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=496.8s	496.8	 I know you're not asking about this, but I'm a step ahead of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=500.1s	500.1	 That's within my questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=503.6s	503.6	 So then the next step to teaching Fetch is to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=506.7s	506.7	 Throw it just a few inches away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=509.5s	509.5	 People teach Fetch by throwing the toy and hoping their dog figures out how to bring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=512.1s	512.1	 it back and they call them and that's a disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=514.4s	514.4	 You won't teach a good Fetch that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=515.9s	515.9	 So essentially, Fetch is something that evolves from tug of war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=521.3s	521.3	 Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=522.3s	522.3	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=523.3s	523.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=524.3s	524.3	 Right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=525.3s	525.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=526.3s	526.3	 Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=527.3s	527.3	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=528.3s	528.3	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=529.3s	529.3	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=530.3s	530.3	 Let's see if I can just get her to kind of move that toy an inch towards me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=533.0s	533.0	 And if she does, I'm going to play tug with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=535.1s	535.1	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=536.1s	536.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=537.1s	537.1	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=538.8s	538.8	 Just light tug off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=540.1s	540.1	 She's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=541.1s	541.1	 Anytime you introduce a new toy, make it enticing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=544.3s	544.3	 Make it interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=545.3s	545.3	 Don't just give it to them and hope they figure it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=547.2s	547.2	 My goal here is to see if I get her to bite it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=549.0s	549.0	 If she bites it, we're well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=550.6s	550.6	 And it's an off-putting texture to a lot of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=552.7s	552.7	 Let me just see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=553.7s	553.7	 I'm going to roll it here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=554.7s	554.7	 Oh!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=555.7s	555.7	 That was a really significant development just then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=559.8s	559.8	 She grabbed it by the rim as it was rolling on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=564.0s	564.0	 She went for it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=565.0s	565.0	 I'm not going to...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=566.0s	566.0	 And notice how I'm keeping it moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=567.3s	567.3	 I'm trying to keep it from getting boring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=569.0s	569.0	 Once it's still, it's less interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=572.5s	572.5	 So we want to keep it alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=573.5s	573.5	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=574.5s	574.5	 I'm going to let her win that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=579.5s	579.5	 I'm going to do a gentle pull here just to keep it on her level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=584.0s	584.0	 She's really afraid of my umbrella.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=586.1s	586.1	 Oh, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=587.1s	587.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=588.1s	588.1	 I made the mistake of opening it too close to her a few weeks ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=591.7s	591.7	 Counter conditioning exercise is a protocol in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=594.9s	594.9	 Do I have an umbrella in here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=595.9s	595.9	 Yeah, we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=597.8s	597.8	 By counter conditioning, you're trying to change a perception to something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=602.2s	602.2	 Step one, set it on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=603.7s	603.7	 Step two would be this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=605.9s	605.9	 Moving it around, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=607.3s	607.3	 And then rewarding five, ten times for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=610.1s	610.1	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=612.1s	612.1	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=614.5s	614.5	 And then let it make some noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=617.8s	617.8	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=619.8s	619.8	 Look at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=620.8s	620.8	 She's a chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=621.8s	621.8	 And then I'm going to open it like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=625.5s	625.5	 See this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=627.1s	627.1	 This is what's not intuitive if you're new to training dogs, that you need to go this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=631.0s	631.0	 slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=632.0s	632.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=633.5s	633.5	 When reintroducing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=634.5s	634.5	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=638.5s	638.5	 Now she's looking a little more apprehensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=642.3s	642.3	 Go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=643.3s	643.3	 See how I'm going up and down here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=645.3s	645.3	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=649.3s	649.3	 That's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=650.3s	650.3	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=655.2s	655.2	 Taking tiny steps.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=663.7s	663.7	 Right now she just wants to play with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=665.7s	665.7	 Oh god.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=668.7s	668.7	 Is there any utility in, you know, I try to redirect her most of the times, but I will,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=675.9s	675.9	 maybe I should stop doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=677.5s	677.5	 Sometimes I raise my voice and say no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=680.1s	680.1	 Sometimes I say, just, hey, really loud, then she stops, like, digging at the couch or...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=685.4s	685.4	 I mean, you know, we're human and I don't think you're going to traumatize her by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=689.1s	689.1	 There's no need to raise your voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=691.0s	691.0	 You ought to find that as long as you're, if you say no monotone and you just go over

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=697.7s	697.7	 So it'll be more intelligent long run to just be like, no, stop that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=701.7s	701.7	 What are you doing?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=706.8s	706.8	 the same effect as long as you're providing the action afterwards of escorting her away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=711.1s	711.1	 from the things she's chewing on and asking for the sit and then rewarding for the compliant

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=716.5s	716.5	 It looks like you've been addressing the puppy biting slowly but surely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=718.9s	718.9	 Yeah, she's gotten better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkJ2RHSsGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=405&pp=iAQB&t=720.2s	720.2	 Yeah, that's, then you're doing fine.
