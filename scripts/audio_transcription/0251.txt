https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today, we're going to see what's new with one of the most interesting pieces of technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 in the entire dog world, the Furbo dog camera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=9.3s	9.3	 If you followed me, you'll know that I've been using Furbo dog camera for many years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=12.9s	12.9	 now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=13.9s	13.9	 I consider it one of the most valuable tools that I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=17.1s	17.1	 Furbo is a camera that lets you see and actually talk to your dog anytime you want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=22.4s	22.4	 You can give them treats remotely and you can get notified when they're barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 It actually knows the difference between howling, crying, barking, and continuous barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=30.6s	30.6	 It can alert you if a person is in the house, if your dog has been active for a while, if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=34.7s	34.7	 a smoke or a carbon monoxide alarm is going off, and basically automatically notify you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 of everything important that happens with your dog throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 And what fascinates me is how do they get this thing to do all of that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=47.1s	47.1	 To me, one of the most stressful parts about having a dog is not knowing exactly what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 going on with them when you're not there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=53.9s	53.9	 Furbo really does solve this problem better than any product I've seen so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 They gave me an awesome offer for you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=61.1s	61.1	 I'm going to have it in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 Let's look at what differentiates Furbo from other products on the market and you can determine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=67.1s	67.1	 if it's worth it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 One of the most obvious benefits of Furbo is that you can give your dog a treat from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=71.5s	71.5	 anywhere when you're not home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 Now, one note, when you first introduce Furbo to your dog, you want to do it very cautiously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=76.8s	76.8	 and at a distance to really get your dog familiar with what it does so they don't have treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=81.4s	81.4	 shooting at them from the sky all of a sudden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=83.5s	83.5	 I'll have a video below where I showed you how I introduced Furbo to Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=87.3s	87.3	 Now, you can put any kind of treats in here so you don't have to use some weird proprietary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 I actually like to put a mixture of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 I have like kibble in here and then I have some freeze-dried sweet potatoes I like to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 mix things up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=99.1s	99.1	 In Inertia's case, I really like her to be extra surprised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=101.8s	101.8	 You'll notice too that sometimes Furbo shoots out one treat, sometimes it shoots out two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 or three treats or even more to really keep things super random for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 Randomness is very effective when you're trying to get your dog to like something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 So this is how it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=114.3s	114.3	 You just launch the Furbo app on your phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=116.2s	116.2	 We actually have two Furbos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=117.7s	117.7	 We have one in Atlanta at our place there and then we have one in New Orleans, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=121.5s	121.5	 is right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=122.5s	122.5	 So you can see there we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=125.2s	125.2	 You just tap this right here and it'll launch treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 And you can see naturally Inertia's quite interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 And Inertia loves it when like four or five small treats come out and you can easily talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 to your dog here through the app, which is cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=138.5s	138.5	 So I'm going to go around the corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=139.5s	139.5	 I'm going to call Inertia and I'm going to reward her for coming to the Furbo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 All right, this is cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=144.3s	144.3	 Inertia come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=145.3s	145.3	 So you can see she comes running.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=147.7s	147.7	 Let me go ahead and reward her for coming when called.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=151.1s	151.1	 And I can just launch it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=154.1s	154.1	 At first glance, the camera and the treat tossing ability really shine as standout features
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 of the Furbo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 And they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 But honestly, the real time smart alerts to me are what set the Furbo apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=165.9s	165.9	 With a traditional webcam, for example, what do you have to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 You have to like pull out your phone and manually check in to see how your dog is doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=172.4s	172.4	 If Furbo is watching, even when you aren't in particular, the bark alerts are very useful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 We would know, wouldn't we Inertia?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=180.5s	180.5	 Don't look like you don't know what I'm talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=182.9s	182.9	 Dogs bark and some more than others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 You guys know that this has been one of my dog Inertia's biggest issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=190.2s	190.2	 While I was able to get her barking under control when I was with her, she really struggled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=194.3s	194.3	 to relax sometimes when we were away from her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=197.3s	197.3	 And this has been instrumental in making progress on that issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=200.5s	200.5	 Let's test the barking alert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=202.1s	202.1	 Inertia, speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 That's very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 Speak again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=207.2s	207.2	 So right there, you can see it just came up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 I mean, that's pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 I like that I get it on my watch too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=216.7s	216.7	 So if you have a smart watch, that's pretty neat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 It's one thing to be notified when your dog is barking, and that's extremely useful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=222.9s	222.9	 But on top of that, Furbo allows me to actually train Inertia how to be quiet by reinforcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 moments of calm, quiet behavior, which is the real trick to resolving unwanted barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=234.7s	234.7	 So when Inertia is playing around the house and being quiet, I can offer her a treat so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=238.3s	238.3	 that she'll learn to equate that acceptable quiet behavior with a fun reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 So this really makes Furbo invaluable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=245.2s	245.2	 The artificial intelligence this has is extremely impressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 I mean, you can tell the difference between barking, howling, crying, or continuous barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=253.2s	253.2	 I think it's great that they distinguish between these different types of vocalizations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 because every one of those sounds can mean something different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 If your dog is howling or crying, this might indicate that they're feeling more anxious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 than normal, which can help you identify potential issues like separation anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 It's also really helpful to see which things are more likely to make your dog bark, like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 passing joggers, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=274.1s	274.1	 Learning what triggers your dog helps you address things like barking much more efficiently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=277.9s	277.9	 when you're training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=278.9s	278.9	 I've been using Furbo for years now, and I love how they take all of their user feedback
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=283.4s	283.4	 and they're constantly making improvements by adding new features.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=287.4s	287.4	 Because of regular software updates, Furbo just continues to get better the longer you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=291.2s	291.2	 have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=292.2s	292.2	 So it's basically future-proof.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 And I really appreciate that because not a lot of dog tech does that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 Let's go over the dog activity alerts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=299.3s	299.3	 It can be very valuable to know how active or not active your dog is while you're away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=304.3s	304.3	 If your dog is getting active and getting the zoomies all day, as Inertia sometimes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI7y9NttkxU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=252&pp=iAQB&t=308.0s	308.0	 does, it's very nice to know that.
