https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=22.6s	22.6	 I was checking out the Kindle edition of my book recently,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 So I thought that was an interesting thing to talk about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=30.6s	30.6	 I only wish we had more of these greenies so I could share them with everyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 Whoa!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 Since I'm giving away so many books,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 I'll give away a bunch of greenies to each person who wins a book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 These are so great because they have that really unique chewy texture that dogs obviously love.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 Dogs can really sink their teeth into these all the way up to their gum,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 so it rubs away placans harder just like a toothbrush does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 There's even a grain-free formula.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=52.6s	52.6	 If you notice that your dog or cat's breath needs a little extra pick-me-up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=55.8s	55.8	 you can give them these breath buster bites,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 which I like to think of as doggy or kitty breath mints.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 And is that not the cutest little greenie you have ever seen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=62.4s	62.4	 Have you ever tried to give your dog or cat a pill before?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 Greenies pill pockets make it so much easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=67.7s	67.7	 You just squish one of these tasty little pockets around any size pill.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=89.3s	89.3	 The number 10 most highlighted point in my book is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 for the next year, I strongly recommend insisting that your dog hold a sit-stay for 5 to 10 seconds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 at every open door leading to the outside before allowing her to walk through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 Be really consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=104.2s	104.2	 This is a biggie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 This truly is a life-saving skill and should be prioritized very early on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=109.7s	109.7	 You're going to chew the metal part of your leash?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=112.2s	112.2	 Puppy logic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 Let's go to the number 9 most highlighted point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 When I have a new dog, my protocol is to attach a 4 to 6 foot leash to my belt loop during the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=121.1s	121.1	 so that when I get up to go to the kitchen, check the mail, or do yard work, my dog is with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=126.3s	126.3	 I regularly encounter skepticism as to the practicality of this point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=130.6s	130.6	 but it really isn't as inconvenient as you think it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 By having your dog attached to you with a leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=135.4s	135.4	 you're right there to prevent bad habits from getting started,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 but more importantly, you're there to communicate what you do like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=142.2s	142.2	 There's nothing like having a dog attached to you to really encourage you to interact with them a lot more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 Of course, if you do have your puppy tied to you, you may need to put up with stuff like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 Number 8.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 For treats during primary training sessions, again, use tiny pieces of real chicken or other meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=157.5s	157.5	 The reward should be about the size of a grain of rice for small dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=160.8s	160.8	 and no larger than a pea for larger dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 You really want to make sure that you're using a treat that your dog loves, not just likes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 Dog treats do have their place though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 I've never smelled dog treats that smell like blueberries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 In fact, having treats that keep well at room temperature on hand at all times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=175.8s	175.8	 will really speed up the training process if you strategically use them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 Number 7.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 Don't use treats for fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 Trying to teach a dog fetch within minutes of using food is a bad idea in most cases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=187.5s	187.5	 as the dog is in food mode and less likely to be grabby with their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=191.8s	191.8	 The reward for a proper fetch should be the toy or the object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=195.5s	195.5	 It's true, many dogs are a lot less playful when food is on their mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=199.4s	199.4	 I love it when the dog will play tug with frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=201.5s	201.5	 Yes, I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 Number 6.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=203.6s	203.6	 The fastest way to achieve a bond with most dogs is through activities that involve play,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=208.5s	208.5	 such as fetch or tug of war or even a game of chase in the backyard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 As Plato once said, you can discover more about a person in an hour of play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=217.4s	217.4	 than in a year of conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=219.2s	219.2	 So if your dog likes to play, play with them often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 Watch your fingers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 Number 5.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=224.4s	224.4	 Prepare to spend 20 minutes to one hour per day of training and exercising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 at least 5 days a week for the first 6 months to one year of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 Teaching a dog takes a year of consistently working with them in lots of different contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=237.8s	237.8	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=239.2s	239.2	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=239.8s	239.8	 Real life leave it right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 Didn't even do it on purpose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=242.6s	242.6	 Number 4.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=243.4s	243.4	 If you ask your dog to come and she doesn't, then it's on you to snap into training mode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=248.1s	248.1	 for a few seconds or even a minute and motivate her to come to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=251.9s	251.9	 regardless of what you're busy doing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=255.5s	255.5	 Now see it through and make sure you get the result you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=258.7s	258.7	 I'm glad you guys are picking up on this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=260.5s	260.5	 Consistency is so important when you're training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=263.5s	263.5	 Now it's time for the number 3 point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=265.5s	265.5	 Remember to put away your dog's favorite toys unless you're playing with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 That way your pet will be excited when you do bring them out as a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 If special toys like balls, frisbees, and tug toys are just left out all the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=277.8s	277.8	 they'll lose their potency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=279.4s	279.4	 In other words, don't do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 By keeping this toy alive and fun, you're much more likely to keep your dog engaged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 when you use play to train them, which can be one of the most valuable ways to teach many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=291.2s	291.2	 And the last thing you want is for such a valuable form of currency like tug of war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACSWEx9zrc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=427&pp=iAQB&t=295.2s	295.2	 and this rope toy to just become another chew toy to your dog.
