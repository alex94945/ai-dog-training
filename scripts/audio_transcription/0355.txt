https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=2.0s	2.0	 How many of you are still using pads like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=4.5s	4.5	 Stop it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=5.2s	5.2	 I mean, they're thin, they're flimsy, they're messy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=8.2s	8.2	 They move around everywhere and you have to constantly replace them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=11.7s	11.7	 That's different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 What is this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=14.4s	14.4	 That's really stuck to the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 Well, this changes everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=22.1s	22.1	 Those pads will never work for me because I have a boy dog and he lifts his leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 Don't you see?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=28.1s	28.1	 That's the miracle here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 These can stick to just about anything and can be optimized for any dog to pee any way they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=35.4s	35.4	 WizSmart dog pads are the only ones that have stay-put tabs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 If your pad isn't stuck to the floor, you risk this happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=46.1s	46.1	 Oh, by the way, they happen to be way more absorbent than any other potty pad out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 The great thing about these is that you only have to use one or two WizSmart pads per day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=54.7s	54.7	 Since these are ridiculously absorbent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 If you want to get the best dog pads, get WizSmart pads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=60.2s	60.2	 They're the only ones with stay-put tabs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=62.8s	62.8	 I'm going to have a link in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 Where's the dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 There she is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=70.8s	70.8	 Look at that flexibility.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 It makes a great companion to these videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 Lots of you are having issues with potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=86.6s	86.6	 Look, I totally get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=87.8s	87.8	 Let's cover the top 7 reasons that you're having trouble house training your dog and how to fix it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=92.9s	92.9	 Number 1, you're giving your dog too much freedom too early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=97.5s	97.5	 Yeah, you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 This is by far the easiest mistake to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=101.3s	101.3	 I mean, it's easy to assume that if your dog's inside that they're in a controlled environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=106.3s	106.3	 You'll need to methodically control their environment by having them on leash like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 I mean, that should be the case most of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 But when that's impractical, you should have them in an otherwise controlled environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=116.6s	116.6	 like a crate or puppy proof room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=118.7s	118.7	 Having your dog on leash like this prevents them from sneaking off into the other room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 And it puts you in the ideal position to offer feedback to your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=126.6s	126.6	 to let them know what you like and what you'd prefer they not do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 Number 2, you're expecting your dog to let you know when they have to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 You shouldn't expect a dog new to house training to automatically alert you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=137.2s	137.2	 when they have to do their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 Dogs don't instinctively understand that you want them to go in a specific area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 So it's on you to show them where to go over a prolonged period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 Let's put things in perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 I mean, you wouldn't expect a three month old child to let you know when they have to go, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 Then why would you hold a dog to such a high standard so early on in the training process?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=156.9s	156.9	 Number 3, you're not taking your dog out frequently enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=160.3s	160.3	 Whoa, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=163.8s	163.8	 In general, you should give your dog the opportunity to go in the appropriate place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 two to three times more often than you think they need to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=170.8s	170.8	 Now, I understand that you'd rather they go every time you give them the opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=174.1s	174.1	 in order to optimize your time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 And as counterintuitive as it seems, by taking your time and going the extra mile here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 you'll actually potty train your dog a lot quicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=183.3s	183.3	 Your job is to give them the opportunity to relieve themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=186.3s	186.3	 before they even realize they have to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 This is also how you're going to teach them to develop a preference to various textures,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 whether it's grass or pee pads or any other texture that you want them to go on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=197.3s	197.3	 Remember, dogs develop preferences to textures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 So that's one of the big goals during this period of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=202.7s	202.7	 Number 4, you're expecting them to generalize too quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 Dogs don't easily generalize where to do their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=209.8s	209.8	 So you have to methodically show them where they can and can't go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=213.4s	213.4	 For example, your dog might quickly come to realize that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 okay, the living room is off limits, but that won't necessarily prevent them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=219.7s	219.7	 from going off to a spare bedroom to relieve themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=222.7s	222.7	 In other words, dogs don't generalize that your entire house is off limits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=226.8s	226.8	 from peeing and pooping at one time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 It's a really gradual process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=231.3s	231.3	 Generally, if you're following my house training advice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=233.4s	233.4	 the more time that a dog spends in a specific area of the house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=237.3s	237.3	 the less likely they are to have accidents in those parts of the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=240.7s	240.7	 Number 5, you're relying too much on correcting your dog instead of teaching them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 This mistake is common throughout all of dog training, not just house training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 I mean, how many times have you heard that you should show your dog their mess
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=252.8s	252.8	 and then scold them when they have an accident in the house?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 There's no data really showing that this is effective at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=257.8s	257.8	 In fact, it'll likely hinder your bond and slow down your overall training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=261.5s	261.5	 Look, nobody's perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=262.8s	262.8	 But if your dog has an accident in the house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=264.9s	264.9	 it's important for you to take accountability and understand that it's 100% your fault, not theirs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=270.6s	270.6	 So you'll just need to follow my house training advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 and be more proactive moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=275.0s	275.0	 Number 6, adjust your expectations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 A new dog has a lot to learn over the coming years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=280.8s	280.8	 They'll need to understand how to behave in various contexts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 how to listen to you in different environments, and many other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=287.9s	287.9	 Just as we don't establish certain habits in a couple of weeks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 nor does a dog brand new to training understand that they're to behave a certain way consistently forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=297.4s	297.4	 Establishing a good habit, in this case house training your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=300.5s	300.5	 requires tons of repetition by proactively showing them when and where you want them to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=306.2s	306.2	 You're not out of the woods on house training for an entire year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=309.1s	309.1	 Now look, you might be able to get 80% there within just a few weeks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=312.5s	312.5	 but you do not want to let your guard down for a full year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=316.1s	316.1	 Number 7, your dog tears up potty pads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=318.8s	318.8	 Now if your dog likes to tear up pee pads, there are some things you can do to reverse that habit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=330.5s	330.5	 they might associate that with a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=332.2s	332.2	 Because how often do you take something out and give it to your dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bgWesYl5I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=335.0s	335.0	 We want to try to get that out of their head.
