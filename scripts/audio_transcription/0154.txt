https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 We're continuing on with the Biscuit series and we're almost at the end of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=3.1s	3.1	 And I have been so proud of everything that Biscuits has accomplished so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=6.6s	6.6	 We've had some rocky moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=7.9s	7.9	 No!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 We've had some smooth moments, but all of the moments have been completely enjoyable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=12.9s	12.9	 Being a YouTube dog trainer with a good size following opens me up to a fair amount of critiques,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=17.4s	17.4	 which I welcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=19.1s	19.1	 And I honestly think it's probably one of the best gifts I could receive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=22.6s	22.6	 But today, I'm going to go there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 I know a lot of people who watch my videos have puppies and they're looking for a great way to keep their training on track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=29.9s	29.9	 You might want to consider signing up for Pup Box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 And I mean, when you're new to training a puppy, one of the most challenging things is knowing what to work on when.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=37.2s	37.2	 And that's the problem that Pup Box tries to help you with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=39.9s	39.9	 Every single month, they're going to give you training advice based on your puppy's specific age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 And you get a ton of information on a card like this, both sides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 So for example, this card comes with a three-month box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=51.7s	51.7	 So a three-month-old dog, you know, the priorities are developing a bond, focusing on positive reinforcement training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 how to address potty training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 and of course, the inevitable puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=60.7s	60.7	 Look at her. She's chewing on the carpet right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=62.6s	62.6	 This is a great toy. We're going to get her interested in this instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 Now, she's interested in that and not my carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=69.7s	69.7	 You get these ultra high quality treats as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=72.5s	72.5	 Every item in a Pup Box is designed to help you train your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 Pumpkin flavored teething rings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 That's what it's like getting a Pup Box when you have a young dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 You're like, this is exactly what I've been missing in my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 If you want to try Pup Box, they're going to give you half off your first box when you sign up for a plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=88.1s	88.1	 By going to my special link, pupbox.com slash Zach and using code Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 I'll have the info below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 There's this seemingly endless debate in dog training on what methods should be used in what specific contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 Training dogs is objectively a scientific field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 And that means critical thinking and the implementation of the scientific method are the best tools that we have to achieve success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=109.7s	109.7	 And it's true that different trainers are going to have different goals and different outlooks when it comes to teaching dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 Our goal is to bring about optimal behavior without compromising a dog's quality of life or having unintended consequences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=120.8s	120.8	 Now, in the 18 years that I've been training dogs, I've encountered things that have caused me to reevaluate and alter the way that I teach dogs, as well as how I advise you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 In fact, the more that I train dogs, the more I realize how much I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 And I embrace that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=134.9s	134.9	 But being a professional dog trainer, part of my obligation is to participate in the spirit of peer review.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=140.5s	140.5	 And I think we all do this in the interest of progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=143.7s	143.7	 So there's nothing personal about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 I certainly don't take it personally when I'm criticized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 Now, when we use the term balanced dog training, technically that means using a combination of methods that involve rewards as well as corrections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 It can be easily argued that every dog trainer on earth is using some level of correction or punishment in their dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 After all, limiting a dog's access to chasing a squirrel across the street can be defined as being unpleasant to a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=169.3s	169.3	 So by that measure, I guess I'm a balanced dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 But what I'm talking about is using physically aversive methods like leash pops or using electric collars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=177.1s	177.1	 proactively delivering an unpleasant feeling to discourage undesired behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 And the thing is, these approaches represent like a huge percentage of my dog training peers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=188.6s	188.6	 And so it's not like it's just a fringe segment of the dog training community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 I always have to say this when I talk about this topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=194.4s	194.4	 My critiquing or criticism here is not aimed at everyday pet guardians out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 It is aimed at professional dog trainers who advise you how to train your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=202.3s	202.3	 And deep down, I am glad that they're there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=204.4s	204.4	 Nobody gets into this profession who doesn't have a deep love for dogs and want to help them become better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=210.9s	210.9	 And I totally get it. I mean, if the aim is to stop an unwanted behavior with a quick prompt correction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 and that works in the moment, it certainly appears as though there's benefit there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 I mean, if a dog's pulling on a leash and you pop them with a choke chain to discourage the pulling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=226.9s	226.9	 and the dog seems to stop pulling, well, great, it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 However, it's the unintended consequences of this type of training that are just not discussed enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=236.1s	236.1	 A dog's experiences shape how they live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=238.8s	238.8	 And relying on a strategy that has the possibility to cause a dog to behave fearful or to be intimidated is bound to catch up with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=247.1s	247.1	 Now, I understand that is not the intention of trainers who train this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=250.8s	250.8	 However, it does appear that this is the likely consequence of using these methods in many, many cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=257.2s	257.2	 Now, intuitively, this makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=258.5s	258.5	 After all, we know that if something unpleasant happens to a dog after they do something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=263.4s	263.4	 that's likely to reduce the odds of that behavior happening in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=267.1s	267.1	 I agree with that. But it turns out there's more than one way to get dogs to stop doing things we don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=273.1s	273.1	 Now, one of the most valuable things that I've learned as a dog trainer is to beware of intuition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=279.4s	279.4	 Hypothetically, let's say you appear on planet Earth with no education.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=283.4s	283.4	 You're just here. It'd be very easy to conclude, hey, the Earth is flat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=287.6s	287.6	 And you'd look up at those lights in the sky and probably conclude they're just that lights in the sky,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=292.5s	292.5	 not realizing that there are other star systems with their own set of planets and on and on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 There's nothing intuitive about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=299.3s	299.3	 I think we can all agree there are so many areas in life where we have no idea what it is that we don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=306.6s	306.6	 In fact, we can't know what we don't know until we know it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=311.3s	311.3	 And this point exactly is what, to me, is at the heart of so much dysfunction in this whole dog training industry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 Surely you guys have experienced this in other areas of your life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=322.7s	322.7	 I mean, the more you learn about a subject, the more you realize how much you actually don't know about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=328.1s	328.1	 Now, if you've been following this series with Biscuits the puppy so far,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=331.2s	331.2	 you'll know that teaching her how to accept her crate and be comfortable in it has been quite the challenge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=339.8s	339.8	 One of the things that I want to show her is how to stay at the crate door when I open it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 But you can imagine if she's been in there for an hour or two, she might be really excited to come out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=349.9s	349.9	 And I want to teach her proper conduct on exiting the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=354.4s	354.4	 One powerful example of positive reinforcement training that I'm hoping to illustrate in this lesson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=359.4s	359.4	 is how we don't simply get Biscuits to tolerate the crate, but to prefer being in her crate instead of out of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=367.2s	367.2	 Let's see where we are. Let's do a baseline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=370.3s	370.3	 She goes in there. Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=372.7s	372.7	 My objective here is to have her stay while I open the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=377.1s	377.1	 That's what she does naturally. So right there, I want when I open that door, I want her to think, sit, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=383.9s	383.9	 See the scratching right there? See, she's a little frustrated, probably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=386.7s	386.7	 That's what I think that means. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=389.5s	389.5	 So I'm going to try to bring down the frustration level. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=392.9s	392.9	 I'm going to immediately look for reasons to say yes to keep her engaged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=397.1s	397.1	 See, on one hand, I could accept older and worse information like, I don't know, I'm the alpha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=402.8s	402.8	 You have to be in that crate and you just need to tolerate it because those are the rules and that's the way you have to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=408.2s	408.2	 Of course, we know these days that accepting the outdated be the alpha or the pack leader is a long, outdated concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=415.7s	415.7	 And of course, there's tons of scientific literature to back this up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=418.5s	418.5	 But again, the goal isn't simply, hey, just tolerate being in that crate and be good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=422.4s	422.4	 We want to address the underlying emotional state of biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=426.4s	426.4	 Yes. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=429.2s	429.2	 Give her a quick review. OK, come. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=435.7s	435.7	 Lots of things get you treats here. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=438.2s	438.2	 I'm going to break this down into smaller steps to help her understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=441.2s	441.2	 Yes, by not pushing her to frustration and also while looking for smaller successes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=446.7s	446.7	 we can make progress without risking the setbacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=450.5s	450.5	 Yes. Do you see how I'm trying to avoid her failing at all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=454.4s	454.4	 In that example, we literally had the door open for a split second before she could react
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=459.4s	459.4	 and provided her with something she liked, a piece of her meal before she could even attempt to run out of the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=464.8s	464.8	 We've gotten her comfortable with being in the crate. I'm throwing down a couple of kibbles there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=469.8s	469.8	 Yes, I'm catching her succeeding while opening the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=473.6s	473.6	 Failing would be her going out of the crate on purpose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=477.0s	477.0	 So right now, for this training lesson, I'm trying to teach her the concept of coming out only with permission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=485.6s	485.6	 OK, good. OK, not quite there yet. She anticipated more than I'd like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=489.5s	489.5	 I'm trying to avoid closing the door to prevent her from running out because I want her to think more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=494.9s	494.9	 See how I'm doing it a bit more realistically as we continue on with the training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=498.9s	498.9	 So let's try not to say no. This is what trips people up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=502.2s	502.2	 They're like, if you don't correct them, how will they ever learn?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=504.8s	504.8	 So really good example. It's on me to try and catch her succeeding here. Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=508.6s	508.6	 There's nothing wrong at all with saying the word no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=510.5s	510.5	 However, I point this out to show how overused and unnecessary it is in so many cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=515.1s	515.1	 For example, if I were relying on disciplining or correcting her here for not behaving as I wanted to in the crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=521.0s	521.0	 I don't think I would see her optimistic body language like those bright eyes coupled with her tail wagging and holding her position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=528.0s	528.0	 And again, I understand that tail wagging doesn't always mean a dog is happy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=531.7s	531.7	 but the totality of her body language here appears as though she's in a reduced stress state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=537.4s	537.4	 So my back is turned. I'm going to just like let her check out for just a second, not too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=543.9s	543.9	 So I still want her engaged in this particular training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=546.8s	546.8	 But I'm gradually trying to simulate more and more realistic conditions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=552.2s	552.2	 Yes. OK, we've communicated so strongly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=557.8s	557.8	 that staying in the crate works for her, that she's actually reluctant to come out of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=563.3s	563.3	 OK, come on. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=565.6s	565.6	 She had to think there. And that's really what we're trying to make happen here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=569.5s	569.5	 She's like, being in here is wonderful. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=573.2s	573.2	 That's what's so fun about positive reinforcement training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=575.5s	575.5	 You get to really find lots of fun reasons to interact with your dog in a way that they enjoy and you enjoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=582.0s	582.0	 And I mean, just watching her learn is special, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=587.8s	587.8	 OK. Oh, interesting moment there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=593.0s	593.0	 It's like she started to break and then she sat and then I preemptively released her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=598.3s	598.3	 And she's like, no, I'll stay here instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=600.6s	600.6	 I'm thrilled with this training session right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=602.9s	602.9	 She's not perfect yet for her first training session on this particular thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=606.9s	606.9	 I think this was a great example of how to connect with the dog in a way that is enjoyable for you and your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=613.2s	613.2	 By the way, so many of you have been asking about our sponsor's crate, the Diggs Revel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=616.8s	616.8	 It's really sturdy and high quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=618.8s	618.8	 And I love that it gives you lots of options for your dog to reward them from the top, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=623.2s	623.2	 And unlike most dog crates, it actually looks good. I'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=626.2s	626.2	 Now, one of the more advanced tasks that I'm working on with Biscuits is teaching her how to go to and stay at a predetermined mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=633.2s	633.2	 In this case, a cutting board.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=634.9s	634.9	 You might remember we were using the cutting board to get her to go to her. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=639.6s	639.6	 To go to her mark. OK. Let's see if we can get her a little warmed up real quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=644.4s	644.4	 Believe it or not, we see many trainers use electric collars to teach a dog how to go to a spot and stay like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=649.9s	649.9	 Using electric collars on a low level, which provides a constant, slightly unpleasant feeling to the dog until the dog inadvertently stumbles upon the mark,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=657.5s	657.5	 at which time they'll relieve the pressure of the electric stimulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=661.7s	661.7	 And that's literally what the dog is working for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=664.2s	664.2	 Now, look, if that method were the only way or even a more effective way, I could attempt to appreciate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=669.7s	669.7	 But here I'm doing an experiment and seeing if I can do this by relying exclusively on positive reinforcement training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=675.8s	675.8	 And without using this unnecessary step of providing an unpleasant consequence to the dog, in this case, electric stimulation at their neck,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=684.1s	684.1	 you can see how adding the component of distance, me being farther back over there, seems to make it a little more complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=690.4s	690.4	 I can reliably get her to do it by coming over here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=696.5s	696.5	 Walking with her, can I phase in a hand signal this way? OK, come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=704.5s	704.5	 Yes. Second, she makes contact. OK, with that cutting board here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=713.8s	713.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=719.2s	719.2	 OK. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=721.3s	721.3	 Go to your spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=723.4s	723.4	 Here's a clear example of her doing something I definitely don't want her doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=727.1s	727.1	 I don't want her scratching at her mark like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=729.6s	729.6	 How can you use positive reinforcement exclusively in an instance where your dog is doing something that you definitely don't want them to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=737.3s	737.3	 Biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=740.3s	740.3	 Yes. And see, even there, it's tempting to really get in there and say, no, don't do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=744.8s	744.8	 But really, if you give them that alternative thing to do, in this case, coming to me, did you see the spirit of the dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=749.6s	749.6	 In this case, coming to me, did you see the spirit with which she was running towards me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=752.8s	752.8	 That's what we want. Her mood isn't killed. You're not frustrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=755.8s	755.8	 The magic moment comes when she's looking at my finger and then looks ahead of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=759.4s	759.4	 That's what I'm looking for. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=761.8s	761.8	 Love how she's troubleshooting. OK, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=765.8s	765.8	 Good. I'm going to elect not to reward there, just to keep it random.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=769.8s	769.8	 Starting to phase out treats a bit. Let me give her a point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=772.4s	772.4	 Yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=777.4s	777.4	 A little little guidance back there to get all four paws on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=780.4s	780.4	 Yes. Notice how she's not breaking on the word yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=784.8s	784.8	 She knows the difference between yes and the letters O and K by walking around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=790.4s	790.4	 I'm kind of encouraging her to reorient herself to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=795.8s	795.8	 That was me. I have no idea what that's about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=800.2s	800.2	 What do you see, girl? What is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=802.6s	802.6	 I think she must have heard something in the bedroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=805.0s	805.0	 I've got inertia in there. You can see her pile of erection right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=809.4s	809.4	 It's where their hair stands up. Usually means a dog is a little unsure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=813.0s	813.0	 So in this case, I'm not going to yell at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=815.2s	815.2	 You can see that she's not really feeling it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=817.2s	817.2	 She's not feeling it. She's not feeling it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=821.4s	821.4	 A dog is a little unsure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=822.8s	822.8	 So in this case, I'm not going to yell at biscuits or discipline her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=826.4s	826.4	 I'm going to give her a second to recalibrate when she realizes this isn't really getting or anything and see what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=831.6s	831.6	 The real goal of training dogs is to teach them how to think for themselves and problem solve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=836.2s	836.2	 Go to your spot. Yes. Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=840.2s	840.2	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=844.8s	844.8	 Okay. Good. Releasing her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=848.8s	848.8	 Go to your spot. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=857.6s	857.6	 And you remember.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=861.6s	861.6	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=863.4s	863.4	 You see how she put them on there for a second. All four with a point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=867.0s	867.0	 While this skill is so often trained with negative reinforcement or applying a physical punisher,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=871.4s	871.4	 I want to let you decide if it looks easier and more pleasant to the dog to train it using positive reinforcements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=878.2s	878.2	 Mixing play like this and with training can really be beneficial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=881.2s	881.2	 Maybe that's in the form of playing with a dog or fetch or anything, but it's a really good way for their brain to reset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=888.2s	888.2	 She's a terror.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=889.4s	889.4	 I mean, I was a kid who loved recess. So I don't know about you guys, but that's what it reminds me of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=896.0s	896.0	 Notice how cautious inertia is to not step on her with her back feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=900.0s	900.0	 And I hear some of you out there, right, Zach? That's all great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=902.8s	902.8	 But what do you do when you're out of your nice cozy living room and you got to go train in the real world?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=907.6s	907.6	 That is how some of you sound, you know, but I applaud the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=910.2s	910.2	 Let's make our way down the mountain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=912.4s	912.4	 Snowy. This is Zach's literal first time driving on snow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=916.4s	916.4	 Where I'm from in Atlanta, if there's ice anywhere in the city on the road, we're shut down in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=921.2s	921.2	 Solid snow. I got four-wheel drive though, baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=925.2s	925.2	 Well, all-wheel drive. So yeah, we're in trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=929.0s	929.0	 Fortunately, down here, there's no snow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=931.8s	931.8	 When you're having your dog exit the car,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=934.2s	934.2	 it's a really vital time to teach them how to stay in this specific context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=941.8s	941.8	 Yes. Good. I'm just reminding her, because I actually haven't done this in public yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=945.6s	945.6	 You can see there's a car coming. So we're going to be extra careful here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=948.4s	948.4	 Always be aware of your surroundings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=951.8s	951.8	 Notice I haven't said stay either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=953.6s	953.6	 In other words, with her, I think it's good if she just assumes this is how I behave when a human comes near the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=960.8s	960.8	 Here. Okay. Let's go. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=964.4s	964.4	 Got a little bit of traffic out here today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=966.2s	966.2	 Nice amount of healthy distractions. Socialization opportunities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=970.2s	970.2	 Wow. Isn't this place beautiful? Love good dog joining weather.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=974.2s	974.2	 Now, we all know that going in public with a dog presents tons of unknowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=978.8s	978.8	 I mean, you can expect just about anything from mundane everyday events to, I don't know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=983.4s	983.4	 a giant parachute monster coming out of the ground and charging at biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=987.4s	987.4	 Oh. Oh, wow. Holy cow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=990.8s	990.8	 Oh, shoot. You know, I didn't even think about it, but she's trying to gain distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=995.8s	995.8	 In training, there's lots of different options when it comes to handling an issue like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=999.8s	999.8	 And believe it or not, some trainers would actually firmly correct a dog for leaving the immediate area of the trainer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1005.8s	1005.8	 even though the dog was scared by something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1007.6s	1007.6	 And the way that a trainer may justify this is, look, I've got to keep my dog safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1011.6s	1011.6	 They can't be running away from me like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1013.6s	1013.6	 They need to know you've got to stay in my immediate area no matter what and trust me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1017.6s	1017.6	 And the aim is noble. I understand why they do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1021.0s	1021.0	 But I have to ask myself, is there a way to help a dog work through an event like this without forcing them to stay in one spot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1030.0s	1030.0	 I like to avoid correcting a dog who's experiencing fear as I don't want to amplify that fear by doing something that's unpleasant to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1037.2s	1037.2	 Because that can really complicate training in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1039.6s	1039.6	 I mean, dogs remember things. They could easily remember, hey, that one time I was scared,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1044.0s	1044.0	 stressful event imposed upon me, that unpleasant correction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1047.8s	1047.8	 And now I'm not so into that training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1049.8s	1049.8	 So what I opt to do in these situations is allow them to seek safety within reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1054.4s	1054.4	 In this case, Biscuits wanted to walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1056.4s	1056.4	 And ideally, I like them to be able to observe the thing that's causing them to feel uncomfortable from a safe distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1062.2s	1062.2	 She's learned she could come to me for safety here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1065.4s	1065.4	 I'm going to let her take it in from her level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1067.4s	1067.4	 It's like they're doing lessons of some kind to learn how to fly them, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1070.6s	1070.6	 And so in a case like this where she's made sense of the parachute, probably,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1074.6s	1074.6	 I'm in a position to reinforce now her newfound confidence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1078.2s	1078.2	 One thing I'm really paying attention to is what is the ratio between her willingness to pay attention to me during a training lesson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1086.2s	1086.2	 versus her wanting to check out her environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1088.8s	1088.8	 I'm hoping to really balance those two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1091.2s	1091.2	 It's also really beneficial to understand what your dog is into at any given moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1096.2s	1096.2	 Not always easy, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1097.4s	1097.4	 Now, all of us know that Biscuits has been knocking it out of the park on lie down from her past lessons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1102.4s	1102.4	 Do you remember lie down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1103.6s	1103.6	 But look at her right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1104.8s	1104.8	 She's not honoring my request to lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1107.4s	1107.4	 And it seems really tough for her to remember lie down out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1110.4s	1110.4	 This is something she was doing at the house so well very recently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1114.2s	1114.2	 The aversive approach here would be, look, I know you know this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1117.6s	1117.6	 I'm going to make you do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1118.8s	1118.8	 So you understand, dog, that this is not optional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1121.6s	1121.6	 But in reality, I really need to do my best to understand things from her perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1126.0s	1126.0	 For example, is the texture of the grass throwing her off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1128.2s	1128.2	 Is it all the distractions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1129.4s	1129.4	 Is it the environment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1130.4s	1130.4	 Is it some scent in the air?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1132.0s	1132.0	 All of these things should be considered as potential contributors to her not complying with my request.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1137.0s	1137.0	 So while I could just as easily stand on the leash or force her to lie down to take direction from me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1142.2s	1142.2	 she'd most likely not be in the most optimistic mindset moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1146.0s	1146.0	 And that can kill your progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1147.8s	1147.8	 Ideally, I really want her in a favorable state of mind, not only now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1151.4s	1151.4	 but in future instances like this later in life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1154.0s	1154.0	 It's not just as simple as getting your dog to do whatever it is you're trying to get them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1159.6s	1159.6	 You have to consider their overall mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1161.6s	1161.6	 So instead, I'm thinking, OK, let's not push the issue here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1165.0s	1165.0	 Let her check out the things around her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1166.8s	1166.8	 And what can I do to become more interesting to her and more worth listening to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1171.4s	1171.4	 You know, a genuinely fun attitude and good treats often go a really long way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1197.2s	1197.2	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1199.4s	1199.4	 Right now, I mean, we're just doing some screensaver training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1201.6s	1201.6	 but I'm really acknowledging that she's behaving well and calmly around all these distractions out here today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1207.4s	1207.4	 This is good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1213.4s	1213.4	 Biscuits becomes uneasy when a couple of young people walk by.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1224.0s	1224.0	 The barking.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1234.0s	1234.0	 And in this case, just being a little understanding was all that was necessary to get a prompt recovery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1240.2s	1240.2	 Oh.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1247.8s	1247.8	 This is the first artificial distraction I'm going to use out here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1263.2s	1263.2	 I'm loving it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1264.4s	1264.4	 See if we can improve on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1267.6s	1267.6	 One of the great things about an exercise like this is that you can really start to combine things like leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1273.8s	1273.8	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1275.0s	1275.0	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1276.4s	1276.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1278.0s	1278.0	 Throw and lie down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1279.6s	1279.6	 And you can see how well I mean first time every time there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1282.2s	1282.2	 That was a nice little example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1283.6s	1283.6	 I think really one of the bigger takeaways from this particular lesson with me is the tempo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1287.6s	1287.6	 It's like sometimes she'll give me 10 seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1289.6s	1289.6	 Sometimes she'll give me two minutes and then she needs a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1292.4s	1292.4	 And if you can really be there to capitalize on it when they are willingly giving you their attention over time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1297.2s	1297.2	 that will trend into being able to get their attention when you ask for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1300.4s	1300.4	 It's really interesting getting to know her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1302.2s	1302.2	 This is why we're always talking about getting to know your individual dog and understanding them because not all dogs respond the same way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1308.6s	1308.6	 She's getting a ton of socialization of tall grass today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1311.2s	1311.2	 I appreciate that tall grass is something she's going to have to deal with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1314.6s	1314.6	 I mean most grass is probably taller than her anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1318.0s	1318.0	 Biscuits.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1322.4s	1322.4	 They are actual life forms and they will act unpredictably at times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1327.0s	1327.0	 And I'm under no illusion that because I like to train a certain way that this is somehow going to change the way everyone trains their dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwND4O6U1Sc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=1333.8s	1333.8	 And I expect the world will go on, but we'll all continue to do what we think is best for the dogs that we work with.
