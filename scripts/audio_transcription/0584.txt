https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=9.1s	9.1	 Jumping is one of the more annoying unwanted behaviors for most people, but chances are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=13.8s	13.8	 if you have a jumper on your hands, you likely have a very excited, loving, enthusiastic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 Keep things in perspective because that is not such a bad thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 The reason dogs jump is because they like to greet us at the face, but we have to show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=27.7s	27.7	 we prefer a different type of greeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=30.5s	30.5	 Make sure you like me on Facebook.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 we teach our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 Hey, tell me in the comments below, does your dog jump on you and or others?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=42.1s	42.1	 We're going to go inside and meet Ginny the Bastard Hound and her dad, Bryce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 Good to see you, man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=47.3s	47.3	 Good to see you too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=48.3s	48.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 So I understand that Ginny has an issue with jumping, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=52.8s	52.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 Teaching a dog to not jump is actually pretty easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=56.3s	56.3	 But we need to meet them halfway, particularly if you have a high energy dog at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=60.9s	60.9	 We have to make sure we're playing fetch with them, giving them regular exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=64.1s	64.1	 Just a little bit of exercise for her is enough to kind of wipe her out for at least a half
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=67.5s	67.5	 hour to an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=68.5s	68.5	 She recharges them pretty quickly, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 Super quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=71.3s	71.3	 Does she jump on everyone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=72.3s	72.3	 Yes, everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=73.3s	73.3	 I don't think it has to be all or nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=74.9s	74.9	 I mean, dogs are capable of understanding the difference between when it's okay and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 when it's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 I think it's fine if our dogs jump on us as long as we're asking for the behavior, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=83.9s	83.9	 that's up to the individual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=85.5s	85.5	 The good thing about basset hounds, like all domestic dogs, is they were bred specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 to work with people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=90.6s	90.6	 They're hunting dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=91.8s	91.8	 So they are predisposed to understand human beings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 If you know your dog is likely to jump on company coming over and they haven't been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=99.3s	99.3	 exercised or they're just crazy hyper because that's how some dogs are, it's a good idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 to have them on a leash so you can further control the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=106.5s	106.5	 How well does Ginny do like a basic sit, stay for a second or two?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=111.4s	111.4	 She does it pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 Would you mind demonstrating?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=113.4s	113.4	 Ginny, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=116.3s	116.3	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=118.1s	118.1	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=118.6s	118.6	 Oh, that's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 See, you would want your dog to have a sit and a basic stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 If you guys at home don't know how to teach that, check the description of this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 and there'll be a link to a video that will get you to that point.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=131.5s	131.5	 Just saying off or Ginny off once she's up on somebody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 Okay, so that's pretty typical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 This is what most of us do, isn't it?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 her very, very well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 You always see the jumping coming before it happens, can't you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=146.9s	146.9	 Yes, I can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=147.4s	147.4	 If it's too late and you've asked your dog to sit and they're still jumping, at that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=150.9s	150.9	 point it's your responsibility to come over and say, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 I need to give all of my attention to my dog right now and put her into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 I'd like to go over two aspects to unwanted jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=160.4s	160.4	 The first is when guests come in the house and she may be likely to jump and how to resolve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 And the second is how to keep her from jumping as your company remains at the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 Even though she knows sit really well when she's not distracted by a guest coming over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=173.2s	173.2	 now that we're making it kind of complicated, I think we should use a treat to kind of encourage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=177.3s	177.3	 her to sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=181.7s	181.7	 dog to listen to you without treats, I'll have a video in the description that will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=185.3s	185.3	 show you how to get to that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=186.8s	186.8	 But I don't think we're at that point, at least with this many variables and excitement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=190.5s	190.5	 Companies have a choice as to the kind of content that they sponsor.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 And remember, you have a choice as to where you can get your dog food and supplies from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=203.1s	203.1	 There are companies that support positive training.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=207.5s	207.5	 I'm going to walk in and I want you to really be dialed into her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 And if she looks like she's thinking about jumping, that is the time to say, no, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=214.9s	214.9	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=215.9s	215.9	 And ask her to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 And then my goal is to be able to pet her and touch her without her jumping on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=226.7s	226.7	 So I'm going to actually try and pet her and see if, because oftentimes that's when dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=230.4s	230.4	 ah, there it goes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=234.7s	234.7	 Now one important note here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=236.5s	236.5	 A lot of people try and coach the person as to what to do.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=286.5s	286.5	 Good connection here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=287.5s	287.5	 If your dog were an extreme jumper, remember you should have them on a leash at this point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=290.9s	290.9	 so you can prevent them from jumping and ask them to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=294.7s	294.7	 But you know, you're past that, I think, with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=296.8s	296.8	 We're going to do something to increase the odds that she listens more and more as time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=300.1s	300.1	 goes on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=304.9s	304.9	 reward her here and there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=306.1s	306.1	 The reason for that is dogs are going to learn, and all mammals for that matter, much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=310.3s	310.3	 effectively when they are not rewarded every single time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 Hey guys, what's going on?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=321.8s	321.8	 Nice, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=322.8s	322.8	 So reward her that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 I'm going to come pet her right now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=328.2s	328.2	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=331.2s	331.2	 Actually, let's try it again and don't reward her again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=333.2s	333.2	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=336.2s	336.2	 Hey, you're so awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=337.2s	337.2	 And right here, I'm making it a bit tough for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=338.7s	338.7	 Go ahead and ask her to sit and reward the next time she sits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=341.5s	341.5	 Yep, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=342.5s	342.5	 See, if you mix it up like this, this really teaches your dog, well, I might get rewarded,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=346.1s	346.1	 I might not, and it's a good intermediate phase to work towards spacing out treats for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=351.4s	351.4	 basic behavior like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=352.8s	352.8	 Our next step is to get her to behave like this while we're sitting down, hanging out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=357.1s	357.1	 Is she likely to jump if we sit at the kitchen table and hang out for a bit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=360.1s	360.1	 Yes, she will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=361.1s	361.1	 So far, so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=362.1s	362.1	 She's not jumping immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=363.1s	363.1	 Oh, I spoke too soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=365.7s	365.7	 Looks like we have a little bit of work to do on this here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=368.0s	368.0	 Because see, when you're sitting down, it's actually easier for them to jump on you, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=372.4s	372.4	 they're more likely to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 If you need help with counter surfing, I'll have a video in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=378.6s	378.6	 And remember, we're going to randomly give her treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=381.7s	381.7	 We don't want to treat every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 Now, I should say, if your dog is an extreme jumper and they're likely to jump like crazy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=388.3s	388.3	 you should treat almost every single time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=390.8s	390.8	 But since she's passed this point, I think we're good to randomly reinforce her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=394.4s	394.4	 I actually have some ham here, and I'm going to give that to her for offering to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=397.9s	397.9	 I think it's good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=406.2s	406.2	 What position do you play in kickball?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=408.1s	408.1	 Center field.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=411.1s	411.1	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=413.1s	413.1	 So we're having a basic conversation about kickball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=416.8s	416.8	 She starts to jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=417.8s	417.8	 He's right on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=418.8s	418.8	 Just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=419.8s	419.8	 A little late, but better late than never.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=421.2s	421.2	 I mean, it's a lot easier said than done to be preemptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=424.2s	424.2	 So that's something you'll need to practice with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fza5zfV4WHo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=585&pp=iAQB&t=426.4s	426.4	 Nice.
