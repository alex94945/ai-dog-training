https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This video is sponsored by Pupford. Today I'm going to show you how to train lots of different tricks with Goldie the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=5.1s	5.1	 And do you remember when you were cute like that? You're still really cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 If you're new to training your dog, you have to have the right supplies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=10.2s	10.2	 And there are a few essential items that everyone needs when training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=13.7s	13.7	 Pupford has just launched a training starter kit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 The kit comes with their freeze-dried beef liver training treats, which are super high quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 I cannot recommend these things enough. They keep well at room temperature,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 so you can make sure that you always have them anytime and anywhere you need them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 450 treats. That's a lot of training potential in one bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=32.6s	32.6	 You also get this tug toy. You can reward them with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 It's important to teach them fetch. And tug of war is the first step to teaching fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 Let go. Get it. That's how tug of war should look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 Finally, you get one of the most underestimated dog training tools that's really critical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 A 30-foot training lead. Thank you, Pupford, for including this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 This is the thing that everyone forgets about when training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=54.1s	54.1	 See, a lead allows you to teach your dog things at a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 Come when called or eventually how to teach your dog how to listen to you off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=61.7s	61.7	 I'm going to have a link in the description where you can get your training starter kit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 I'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=88.3s	88.3	 Tricks are an excellent way to refine and build sophisticated communication with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=93.3s	93.3	 And that will empower you to interact with your dog in the most natural way imaginable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=98.9s	98.9	 Oh my goodness, Goldie, you need a lot of communication building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 You can clearly see that Goldie is a pretty energetic four-month-old puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=107.3s	107.3	 We're going to start with kind of a challenging one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=109.3s	109.3	 We're going to see if we can get Goldie to speak or bark when we ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=113.4s	113.4	 This can take a little bit of time to teach, but I noticed that she vocalizes every once in a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 So I'd like to see if we can get her to do it on cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 In order to teach your dog speak, you want to have something that they really want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 I'm using small pieces of cooked turkey today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=126.2s	126.2	 And you want to just kind of entice them with it until they vocalize as if to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 hey, I want that. I'm just going to wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 This can take several minutes or even several training sessions, depending on your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 When she just jumps up at the treat, I'm going to ignore that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=139.4s	139.4	 Even though she's offering all sorts of great behaviors like sit and lie down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=143.1s	143.1	 I'm really ignoring those right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 And I'm focusing on the trick that I want to train at this moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=147.7s	147.7	 which in this case is some type of vocalization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=150.7s	150.7	 You can just see her thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 She's like, wow, what a puzzle here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=153.5s	153.5	 I've got to figure this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 Even if your dog looks like they're just thinking about barking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=157.7s	157.7	 go ahead and reward them to give them that feedback.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=160.5s	160.5	 Good. Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=161.7s	161.7	 There was no sound, but she clearly is on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 That was really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=170.2s	170.2	 Yes. Good. That one was a little bit louder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 I could almost hear bark in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=178.6s	178.6	 Yes. Good. Oh, that was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 Did you hear that? It was quiet, but she did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=183.2s	183.2	 And now we're going to give her a jackpot reward and we're going to come to life and make things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=187.3s	187.3	 real exciting to let her know we like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 Now let's go for another success immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=191.6s	191.6	 Yes. Good. I'm still going to reward even though it's not quite as loud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=195.7s	195.7	 So I want to keep the energy positive here and enthusiastic for Goldie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 Yes. Good. Yes. Oh my goodness. That was fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=206.9s	206.9	 Speak. Good. So now she's really getting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=209.9s	209.9	 The light bulb has completely gone off and I'm going to withhold all rewards,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=213.4s	213.4	 at least for right now, unless she progresses until she actually vocalizes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 and gives me a good enthusiastic bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=220.8s	220.8	 Speak. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 Notice how I'm saying speak just after she barks and I'm doing it very deliberately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=227.6s	227.6	 Speak. Yes. Now let's see if it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 Speak. Yes. All right. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=235.1s	235.1	 It is common for dogs to start barking a lot once they figure out that gets them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 So get in the habit of not rewarding when they start barking when you don't ask for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 We've spent, you know, about five minutes, six minutes or so working on this now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=247.8s	247.8	 Goldie needs to learn the obligatory rollover, of course, or play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=251.8s	251.8	 We'll see which one she accelerates with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=254.2s	254.2	 Now you might have noticed she's got a really good lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=256.9s	256.9	 That's a prerequisite to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 Do you see how her hips are shifted over here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 That tells me I need to go this way because I want to go with the path of least resistance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=264.7s	264.7	 I'm just going to lure her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=266.1s	266.1	 And look at that lure. Look how close it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=267.8s	267.8	 Do you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 She's a little reluctant there to go into a rollover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=271.2s	271.2	 That's normal. A lot of dogs don't like going on their back at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=275.9s	275.9	 Now look at the hips. They seem like they might want to go this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 So I'm going to just go with whatever she gives me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 Yes, I'm going to reward that right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=283.4s	283.4	 I'm going to actually stop and reward her right there because that's farther than she's gotten.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=290.5s	290.5	 She's so lanky and klutzy at this age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=292.6s	292.6	 As she's being lured here, I'm actually letting her nibble microscopic pieces of this big chunk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=297.8s	297.8	 And I'm letting her really just kind of nibble ever so slightly at it to really keep her enticed by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 She really rollover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=309.1s	309.1	 That was really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=310.3s	310.3	 Can we go back the other way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=311.4s	311.4	 Goldie is just such a high energy dog that doing training like this is really giving her something to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=317.0s	317.0	 And it's satisfying her brain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 And this can really help your overall training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=321.4s	321.4	 Because even though it's rollover and speak that we've been working on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=324.6s	324.6	 that's really helping us understand her and learn about her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=328.1s	328.1	 She's getting to know how we communicate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=330.0s	330.0	 So that's why these are great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=331.7s	331.7	 This one's a really easy trick that most of you ought to be able to teach your dogs in a single training session, really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=337.4s	337.4	 Let's see if we can teach Goldie to spin around in a circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=340.0s	340.0	 With spin, initially, it's something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 It's a real obvious lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 You'll find that spin will evolve into something like that, a faster lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=350.9s	350.9	 Until eventually you can just say, hey, spin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=353.2s	353.2	 But that's probably going to take a few training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=355.1s	355.1	 So we'll not press that one right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=356.7s	356.7	 So at first, you're just trying to get them to follow that lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=359.5s	359.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=360.9s	360.9	 Notice I'm saying yes the moment she really does what I want or even is on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=365.8s	365.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=366.7s	366.7	 Of course, every dog needs good manners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=368.5s	368.5	 So I think Goldie needs to know how to shake hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=370.6s	370.6	 I've trained Shake in so many different ways and I have no idea which method Goldie is going to respond to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=376.3s	376.3	 So let's find out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=377.4s	377.4	 She'll need to be in a sit for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=378.8s	378.8	 She's trying all the tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=380.6s	380.6	 She jumped that time, so I'm not going to reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=382.4s	382.4	 I'm looking for her to just lift one foot in any way that she wants to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=386.5s	386.5	 I'm going to actually keep her up here because she has a tendency to want to lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=389.8s	389.8	 So I'm going to keep her up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=390.9s	390.9	 I'm going to see if she moves her paw in any way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=393.7s	393.7	 Yes, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=394.4s	394.4	 She just lifted that paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=395.5s	395.5	 She was attempting to kind of jump up or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=398.2s	398.2	 But I preempted it by jumping in with that yes and saying, hey, I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 It's common for a lot of dogs to pick up their leg and try to claw it at your hand if it's got a treat in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 So that might be a good guess right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=408.8s	408.8	 That's what I'm looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=409.8s	409.8	 So keeping it right about here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=411.4s	411.4	 So it's easy for her to lift up her paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=413.4s	413.4	 You see that shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=415.0s	415.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=415.8s	415.8	 And I'm kind of ever so slightly opening my hand to reveal a little bit more of that turkey every time that she succeeds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=421.5s	421.5	 That way I can give it to her instantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=423.1s	423.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=423.5s	423.5	 Even though it was the other paw, I'm going to go ahead and reward there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=425.8s	425.8	 And now I'm closing my hand again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=427.2s	427.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=428.2s	428.2	 Let her nibble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=429.4s	429.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=431.4s	431.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=433.1s	433.1	 Now I'm going to say shake when she does it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=435.7s	435.7	 Shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=437.5s	437.5	 Shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=438.2s	438.2	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 Let's do something a little more crowd pleasing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=440.9s	440.9	 Maybe I'm going to take her leash off for this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=442.6s	442.6	 Goldie, I suspect you are an athlete at heart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 So we're going to see if we can teach you how to do an over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=448.7s	448.7	 An over is where your dog jumps over something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=451.1s	451.1	 In this case, it's going to be my legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=453.0s	453.0	 You want to be cautious when you're working with young dogs on athletic things like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=456.6s	456.6	 But this is low enough that I think it's probably just fine for Goldie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=460.2s	460.2	 So right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=461.6s	461.6	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=462.1s	462.1	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=464.7s	464.7	 See how she's looking at me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=465.7s	465.7	 She's a little confused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=468.4s	468.4	 She's like, this speak work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=469.7s	469.7	 That's not what I'm looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=471.8s	471.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=472.5s	472.5	 Over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=473.0s	473.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=473.5s	473.5	 All I'm looking for here is just a nice enthusiastic effort to go over my legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=478.9s	478.9	 It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=481.0s	481.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=481.6s	481.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=482.5s	482.5	 Since she's doing that so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=484.2s	484.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=484.8s	484.8	 Did you see how she put some jump into that one rather than just walking over my legs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=489.4s	489.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=489.8s	489.8	 Oh, that was a great one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=491.2s	491.2	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=492.2s	492.2	 Over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=493.4s	493.4	 Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=494.2s	494.2	 That was amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=495.5s	495.5	 She actually started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=497.0s	497.0	 Oh, she did it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=498.3s	498.3	 These things get me really excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=500.3s	500.3	 She's demonstrated many times now that she's able to kind of really put some pep into her step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=506.2s	506.2	 That one I'm not going to reward on you because she kind of climbed over me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=508.8s	508.8	 Over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=509.5s	509.5	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=510.1s	510.1	 Boy, that's big air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=512.3s	512.3	 Over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=513.3s	513.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=514.0s	514.0	 You can kind of read her eyes there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=515.8s	515.8	 She was really committed to it, so I decided to say over just prior to her jumping in order
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=521.7s	521.7	 to really communicate to her what that word means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=524.4s	524.4	 Normally, I wouldn't throw so much on a dog in literally one training session here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=528.2s	528.2	 but she's doing so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=529.3s	529.3	 Her attention span's holding up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=531.3s	531.3	 I think that's in huge part because we're keeping things really positive and upbeat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=535.0s	535.0	 for her and finding reasons to reward even small successes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=538.6s	538.6	 But I'd like to see if she can learn how to crawl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=541.3s	541.3	 Your dog's going to need to know how to lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=542.9s	542.9	 You can search my YouTube channel if you're not quite there yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=545.8s	545.8	 So we'll put her into a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8sTLqKfA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=367&pp=iAQB&t=547.4s	547.4	 And again, we're just going to kind of lure it.
