https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3Huon_Y0VI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=516&pp=iAQB&t=69.4s	69.4	 The reason a dog park can be a stressful place for many dogs is that very often at the dog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3Huon_Y0VI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=516&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 but this doesn't necessarily mean that they have a strong dislike of dogs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3Huon_Y0VI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=516&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 That's because an exercised dog is more likely to behave appropriately in new and stimulating
