https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Welcome to our new series where Zach and Bree try to train a puppy while traveling across North America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 I've completely given up on training this dog right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=10.5s	10.5	 Today, our location is liberal Kansas, population 19,000.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 Home to natural gas refineries, rolling farmlands, and seemingly abandoned fairgrounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=21.4s	21.4	 I think we hit the jackpot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=22.6s	22.6	 We were on the road, we decided to stop for a couple of nights,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 and I think I might have just discovered dog trainer heaven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=30.6s	30.6	 Bree, who is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=32.7s	32.7	 I'm your personal dog chef, and I'm making the most exquisite creation for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 Thousands of dollars?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=41.5s	41.5	 Well, you know, the cost of teleportation is out of control these days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 At least it's probably cheaper than gas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 I'm very qualified, as you can see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=49.1s	49.1	 No doubt, fresh food is definitely appreciated by people and their dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=53.4s	53.4	 Chef Pom Pom, couldn't you pre-portion this and freeze it so I always have it whenever I need it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=59.3s	59.3	 I did carefully craft this meal to your dog's specific age, breed, and weight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=64.1s	64.1	 Right, but I thought you were going to portion it out and ship it in an ice cold box to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=68.3s	68.3	 I see what's happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 You meant to order Nom Nom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=72.4s	72.4	 Nom Nom is designed by actual dog nutrition experts to be as perfect as possible for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 They're actually giving half off a two-week trial of their extremely fresh dog food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=84.2s	84.2	 Next time you talk to them, could you please give them my resume?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 Go to trinom.com slash Zach and use my discount code ZACH.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=90.6s	90.6	 I'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=93.3s	93.3	 We've got to explore this awesome fairgrounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=95.9s	95.9	 It is too good to be true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 We have this entire place to ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=100.1s	100.1	 And there must be some great opportunities for the dogs to become better canine citizens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 I'm just not sure what they are yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=106.2s	106.2	 I'm looking behind me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 I see carnival rides that have been taken down basically or whatever for the fair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=112.2s	112.2	 I don't know what they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=113.2s	113.2	 The point I'm trying to make is when you come to a place like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=115.4s	115.4	 there's going to be something new that they see at a pretty high rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 that's really going to benefit them in the long run or it's going to make them crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 I mean, even right now, look at inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 She's very well socialized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=126.4s	126.4	 She's looking up here and she's like, wait a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 I've never seen a roof where pigeons burrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 I think they're pigeons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 What if they're doves?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 Never actually walk both dogs together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 But since there's a nice wide open area here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=137.8s	137.8	 I think we can practice walking them together and see how that goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=141.4s	141.4	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=141.9s	141.9	 Oh, this is an amazing building over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=143.9s	143.9	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 Cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 I want to go check this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=147.1s	147.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=147.7s	147.7	 There's a plaque breed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=149.3s	149.3	 We love plaques.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=150.3s	150.3	 1937.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 Oh, this is so cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 Very uncanny valley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=154.3s	154.3	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=154.8s	154.8	 How's it going walking both dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=157.3s	157.3	 Walking both dogs is kind of a disaster so far, but I don't care so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 because I really just want them to walk around and sniff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=163.7s	163.7	 So if you were a person, there was one person, not a couple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 And you had these two dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=170.1s	170.1	 Do you have any advice for yourself?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 Good luck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=173.7s	173.7	 There's something that feels so much harder about walking two dogs together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=177.1s	177.1	 because it's like one of them gets a little excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=179.2s	179.2	 or the other one gets a little excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 But when they're together, they're like, we are excited too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=183.3s	183.3	 What are we excited about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=184.2s	184.2	 It feels like they kind of like feed off of each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=186.3s	186.3	 Do keep in mind though, this is a free walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=188.6s	188.6	 So I want both dogs to feel fairly liberated to explore and smell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=192.7s	192.7	 and do their own thing even if they are a little bit chaotic on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=196.2s	196.2	 Imagine trying to walk Veronica and inertia together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 and training Veronica to be good on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=200.7s	200.7	 Is that possible?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 Yeah, sure it's possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=203.1s	203.1	 I would do exactly what I'm doing right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=204.9s	204.9	 Just get them comfortable with the environment first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 To me, it's not the most pleasant experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=209.4s	209.4	 when you're trying to force a dog to just pay attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 because you want them to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=213.1s	213.1	 It's more important for them to satisfy their curiosity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=215.5s	215.5	 You might notice how Veronica is pulling and lunging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=218.1s	218.1	 and going here and going there and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 And inertia did the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=221.4s	221.4	 And I posted all of it on the internet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=223.0s	223.0	 Let's see how she's just pulling ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=224.2s	224.2	 I don't like that at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=225.3s	225.3	 I had a good half of the internet saying, you can't train a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 Why would you allow them to do such a thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 My arm is sore just trying to restrain her there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=234.5s	234.5	 But before I can expect them to walk nicely on leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=237.2s	237.2	 I want them to understand the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=238.6s	238.6	 And the way they understand the world is by experiencing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=242.8s	242.8	 But you know how we're always saying train 5, 10 seconds at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 Hey, Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=248.9s	248.9	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=249.8s	249.8	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=252.3s	252.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=253.4s	253.4	 On a free walk like this, though, I'm still going to call them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=255.7s	255.7	 and make sure that I reinforce them coming to me

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=260.1s	260.1	 So they're like rides that are broken down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 Yeah, looks like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=263.4s	263.4	 Scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=264.1s	264.1	 The cliffhanger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=265.6s	265.6	 That looks awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=266.6s	266.6	 Oh, we got a big semi truck coming through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=269.1s	269.1	 I've hardly seen any traffic here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=270.7s	270.7	 Now there's that big truck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 But what a good training opportunity for Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=275.4s	275.4	 Let's let Veronica check it out and see what she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=277.7s	277.7	 Does she notice it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 Does she care?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 Yep, she notices it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=281.3s	281.3	 But I'm going to let her observe it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 I mean, she starts to vocalize and get a little bit concerned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 but I kind of want to play this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=288.2s	288.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=288.6s	288.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=289.6s	289.6	 Hey, I like that you just sat right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=291.5s	291.5	 I'm trying to assess, is she anxious?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=293.3s	293.3	 Does she want to play?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=294.5s	294.5	 I think it might be a combination of everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=296.6s	296.6	 Either way, I love that she's looking to me for direction right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=299.6s	299.6	 And that's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=300.3s	300.3	 It's not about like training your dog to stay when they see a truck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 It's about showing them what the truck is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=305.1s	305.1	 so that they know how to make sense of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=307.2s	307.2	 and so that they can adjust to something strange like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=309.9s	309.9	 That's why, for this walk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=311.5s	311.5	 I've completely given up on training this dog right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=314.9s	314.9	 It's all about Veronica and letting her do what she wants to do right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=318.8s	318.8	 Yes. Within reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=320.7s	320.7	 Half the barking we dealt with last night was random sounds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=324.1s	324.1	 that she had no idea what they were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=325.5s	325.5	 I mean, for all she knew,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 they were spirits from the underworld coming to take her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 Hey, pulls a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=330.5s	330.5	 Look at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=331.5s	331.5	 I know there's that belief by many, even amongst my peers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=335.1s	335.1	 that, man, if you allow that pulling, it can get out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=337.8s	337.8	 If you do it without total regard, sure it can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=340.3s	340.3	 But the compromise I've made is socialization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 trumps proper leash walking at this age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=346.3s	346.3	 To me, I just don't think it's really reasonable to insist on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=349.2s	349.2	 perfect focus from a four or five-month-old puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=351.7s	351.7	 when there's so much else that is important to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=355.2s	355.2	 Even though I really try to avoid asking for too much on walks like these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=359.1s	359.1	 I still definitely want to be here to let Veronica know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=362.3s	362.3	 that I love it every time she voluntarily gives me her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 Seriously, if you want your dog to pay attention to you, try this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=369.7s	369.7	 I think you might be shocked at how much it helps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=371.8s	371.8	 to get your dog in the habit of listening to you overall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=374.3s	374.3	 I'm so happy that our dog, Inertia, our older dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=377.0s	377.0	 is at a place where we can really take advantage of a location like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=380.9s	380.9	 for next-level training for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=382.6s	382.6	 Yeah, me too, because that has definitely not always been the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=385.9s	385.9	 It's so nice to finally be able to just train her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=389.1s	389.1	 and play frisbee with her in this field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=391.3s	391.3	 It's significant because this is a brand new location,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=394.2s	394.2	 and she's listening very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=395.5s	395.5	 Inertia and I have a strong enough foundation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=397.5s	397.5	 that I feel confident in trusting her here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=399.8s	399.8	 Okay, look, I know this place isn't fancy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=402.3s	402.3	 and there's not beautiful streams or amazing nature to look at,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=405.6s	405.6	 but you guys, it's empty right now, and it feels like it's all ours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=411.1s	411.1	 And that's exactly what I want right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=413.5s	413.5	 And just to be transparent, I'm still really methodical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=416.8s	416.8	 about letting Inertia off leash in these places,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=419.7s	419.7	 so I like to measure her compliance ahead of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=422.5s	422.5	 Come, lie down, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=426.3s	426.3	 I'll ask for some basic things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=427.6s	427.6	 A lie down, a sit, will she chase a frisbee?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=430.0s	430.0	 Is she focused on me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=431.1s	431.1	 And if those things add up, then I usually feel pretty confident
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=433.5s	433.5	 that she's going to be reliable in that particular scenario.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=436.1s	436.1	 And if she appeared even slightly distracted by something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=438.8s	438.8	 or wasn't paying attention to me, it's back on leash instantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=441.9s	441.9	 You know, that truck right there, there's no way two years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=447.9s	447.9	 I would have trusted her in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=449.9s	449.9	 I don't think she would have ran in the road,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=451.6s	451.6	 but it's more about the proofing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=453.2s	453.2	 It's more about the practice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=454.4s	454.4	 Remember, proofing is where we practice skills
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=456.6s	456.6	 that our dogs know in various contexts and places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=460.4s	460.4	 Yeah, dogs are so context sensitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=463.0s	463.0	 That is something I did not fully understand before I knew you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=466.4s	466.4	 This is an example of proofing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=467.9s	467.9	 So Inertia's heel training has been doing good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=469.7s	469.7	 You know, heels, whether they stay by your side like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=472.8s	472.8	 and you can walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=476.5s	476.5	 See, switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=477.6s	477.6	 See how our left heel is doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=480.2s	480.2	 Well done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=481.0s	481.0	 Lie down, stand, come around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=484.7s	484.7	 That deserves a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=486.5s	486.5	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=487.1s	487.1	 So here we have a car coming, you know, unexpected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=489.9s	489.9	 I want to be able to have her in a reliable down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=492.8s	492.8	 That's exactly what I'm talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=494.2s	494.2	 One of the things that has helped me train her to be more and more reliable off leash over time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=499.6s	499.6	 has been playing fetch with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=501.0s	501.0	 That's her love language.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=520.3s	520.3	 Because we have this whole place to ourselves, I think it's a great day to plant the seeds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=525.9s	525.9	 for off leash training with Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=527.7s	527.7	 I mean, the level of distractions for Veronica, it's just enough, I feel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=531.8s	531.8	 where she can start to break new ground and learn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=534.3s	534.3	 oh yeah, I listened to you when that thing is going on or this thing is happening.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=542.3s	542.3	 Then we'll see what she'll do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=543.5s	543.5	 What?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=572.6s	572.6	 Veronica.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=580.1s	580.1	 I want to see if she kind of follows me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=581.8s	581.8	 I'm trying to teach Veronica that just staying near me, whether I call her or not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=585.7s	585.7	 is the best way to get all of the wonderful things that she wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=589.1s	589.1	 See, this resembles more of a real world context for come when called,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=593.0s	593.0	 unlike the more set up introductory sessions that we've done in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=597.0s	597.0	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=602.7s	602.7	 problems getting their dog to listen to them in new places, that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=605.6s	605.6	 Here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=613.1s	613.1	 And so far, it's proving pretty effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=614.8s	614.8	 Here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=620.9s	620.9	 That's my favorite.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=634.7s	634.7	 Good, you're not giving a retreat, Zach.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=647.8s	647.8	 Let me call her away from the distraction.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=659.5s	659.5	 I don't have that kind of time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=664.7s	664.7	 at a time of focused training out of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=666.7s	666.7	 So like 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes in the evening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=669.5s	669.5	 or great reminder sessions like we've done here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=671.9s	671.9	 And then the moments that happen throughout the day are all about taking those 30 seconds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=675.3s	675.3	 out of time to implement in a real life context, drawing upon those training sessions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=679.9s	679.9	 what they've learned and spending time with them there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=693.3s	693.3	 How much longer does my puppy have to stay on the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=707.5s	707.5	 That's the caveat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=708.7s	708.7	 Veronica is as fast as a Greyhound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=711.3s	711.3	 I swear there is a 0% chance I will catch her if she does not want to be caught.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=715.5s	715.5	 Huge noob mistake is letting your dog off leash too early,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=720.2s	720.2	 particularly in uncontrolled environments where you have no recourse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=724.6s	724.6	 Personally, I feel like that's your number one dog training tip of all time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=728.2s	728.2	 In my experience, if you go out of your way to show your dog the world over a 24 month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=734.3s	734.3	 timeframe, that's really the minimum I even really consider letting a dog off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=739.5s	739.5	 Come at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=740.8s	740.8	 Maybe I should do a Frisbee lesson with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=742.7s	742.7	 Would you? I would love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=744.2s	744.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=744.6s	744.6	 Veronica?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=750.0s	750.0	 a structured game of fetch intermixed with her general overall training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=754.7s	754.7	 But it looks like her fetch structure still needs some work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=758.7s	758.7	 She's kind of intermittent with Frisbee, but sometimes she'll chase it and not bring it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=762.5s	762.5	 It depends on her mood a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=763.9s	763.9	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=764.3s	764.3	 While Veronica has shown strong interest in playing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=766.7s	766.7	 it looks like at this particular moment, for whatever reason, I'm asking a bit much of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=771.5s	771.5	 I mean, you can see that she gives the disc a look,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=777.6s	777.6	 I'm not going to roll it a third time here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=779.2s	779.2	 I need to take a step back and kind of spell things out for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=782.2s	782.2	 Part of getting her interest in Frisbee has been making it interesting, letting her have it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=786.4s	786.4	 not just playing tug and keeping it from her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=788.9s	788.9	 Let me make it more exciting there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=791.1s	791.1	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=795.1s	795.1	 Yeah, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=796.5s	796.5	 You know, the fact that she came to me there always is more important than her bringing it back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=801.4s	801.4	 in the beginning because come when called, you know, if you look at the hierarchy of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=805.4s	805.4	 skills they need to have is way up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=807.5s	807.5	 So yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=809.1s	809.1	 As she gets into this, she's going to probably start bringing it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=813.0s	813.0	 I'll shorten the distance there so it's easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=815.1s	815.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=815.6s	815.6	 That turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=816.8s	816.8	 Whoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=818.1s	818.1	 YouTube, are you OK?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=819.5s	819.5	 As the camera was falling there, you probably saw Veronica not just chase the Frisbee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=823.3s	823.3	 but actually pick it up and turn around to face me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=826.0s	826.0	 That's a big step in the right direction, and it's a great place to stop while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=829.7s	829.7	 Veronica is still feeling excited about that disc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=833.0s	833.0	 I think the dogs are adapting to trailer life pretty good here so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=836.4s	836.4	 We've worked out with them and they're really doing a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=839.3s	839.3	 They've had their exercise and now they're relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=842.9s	842.9	 And that is how we get a well-behaved dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=845.1s	845.1	 I'm telling you guys, I got this whole dog training thing completely figured out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=851.3s	851.3	 There's a tractor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=853.1s	853.1	 Her barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=854.3s	854.3	 She does bark a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=855.7s	855.7	 Zach George, how do you get your new puppy to stop barking?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=860.2s	860.2	 She just does not know what to do with herself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=862.8s	862.8	 Rather than trying to redirect Veronica's attention onto me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=866.3s	866.3	 I really just want her to kind of satisfy her curiosity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=869.2s	869.2	 let her bark for a little bit if that's what makes her happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=871.9s	871.9	 I feel like that's controversial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=873.3s	873.3	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=873.7s	873.7	 I kind of try to see it from their perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=875.5s	875.5	 We're throwing so much on her for being a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=877.8s	877.8	 So if she sees something that causes her to bark, I'm going to let her bark for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=881.8s	881.8	 Then I'll address it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=882.7s	882.7	 I like to think of it as situational awareness for dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=885.5s	885.5	 We have different criteria for different dogs based on their current experience level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=889.1s	889.1	 and their personality and all sorts of other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=891.4s	891.4	 You know, Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=892.7s	892.7	 Then during that moment of silence that occurs naturally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=895.5s	895.5	 I try to get her attention on me and again remind her that when you feel uncertain about things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=900.0s	900.0	 you can always look to me and I'm going to be able to give you some good feedback.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=903.1s	903.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=903.7s	903.7	 So, good example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=909.0s	909.0	 Waiting for quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=910.3s	910.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=913.1s	913.1	 And now can I get a down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=914.8s	914.8	 Can I get her brain thinking, hey, let me do something else here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=919.0s	919.0	 Woof, woof.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=921.1s	921.1	 By having her lie down and pay attention to me, that's incompatible with looking at something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=925.2s	925.2	 out of the window and barking at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=926.7s	926.7	 She was reasonable enough to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=929.0s	929.0	 Can you relax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=930.3s	930.3	 So yeah, I mean, this is what we're dealing with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=932.0s	932.0	 We have to do this several times a day and that's part of having a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=935.5s	935.5	 You know, you show them consistently how you want them to behave,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=938.5s	938.5	 understand things from their perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=940.3s	940.3	 Like, hey, man, this is all weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=941.8s	941.8	 This is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=942.7s	942.7	 The view outside of those windows is constantly changing in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=946.5s	946.5	 In her case, she's never seen a tractor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=948.1s	948.1	 She doesn't know what that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=949.1s	949.1	 That's weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=950.0s	950.0	 I appreciate that you're alert and curious, Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=953.0s	953.0	 Good job being quiet in her show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=954.4s	954.4	 You've seen plenty of tractors, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=956.1s	956.1	 I mean, the thing is, I wish it was only tractors that she was barking at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=959.9s	959.9	 Yes, but even Veronica makes Veronica bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=965.4s	965.4	 That can make editing our videos very complicated sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=968.4s	968.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=969.1s	969.1	 Oh no, bark-ception.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=971.8s	971.8	 That's your own self barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=973.7s	973.7	 It's normal because it's you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=976.5s	976.5	 That's all right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=977.1s	977.1	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=978.7s	978.7	 Did you hear that though?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=979.9s	979.9	 I think she's making an effort to bark more quietly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=982.8s	982.8	 That's progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=983.7s	983.7	 Yeah, I think she's trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=985.8s	985.8	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=986.3s	986.3	 That's quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=988.0s	988.0	 Very good, Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=989.6s	989.6	 Even though I didn't use a treat or a chew or a reward here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=993.1s	993.1	 that doesn't mean I'm done rewarding her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=995.1s	995.1	 I'm just rewarding her a little bit less than I was before when she complies with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=999.4s	999.4	 But given the severity of those particular outbursts and then her recovery from them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1003.9s	1003.9	 I think I probably would have chosen to reinforce that with something that she likes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1007.5s	1007.5	 But I see what you're saying though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1008.8s	1008.8	 Well, I'm trying to phase out the rewards, but you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1012.2s	1012.2	 I bet it's probably too early because she is still barking a whole lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1014.7s	1014.7	 Yeah, I would try to reinforce a good 90% of compliant behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1018.7s	1018.7	 when she does subside on the barking or when you detect that she's resisting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1022.5s	1022.5	 That's just my opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1023.5s	1023.5	 But there's more than one right answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1025.5s	1025.5	 This is one of the reasons I harp on exercise so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1027.9s	1027.9	 because I've got work to do and dogs are very content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1032.5s	1032.5	 The peaceful atmosphere was so nice while it lasted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1035.7s	1035.7	 but it did not last very long at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1038.8s	1038.8	 What is going on out there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1040.8s	1040.8	 Got some kind of drama going on here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1042.6s	1042.6	 There's these giant trailers pulling in next to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1045.6s	1045.6	 And Ursula's like, well, what's going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1047.3s	1047.3	 I see Bree out there who's on a putty break with Veronica and they're talking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1053.2s	1053.2	 Now you and I were separated when this happened,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1055.2s	1055.2	 but I'm dying to get your perspective on this because everyone can see mine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1058.7s	1058.7	 We had a whole field to ourselves, but not anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1061.1s	1061.1	 I'm sure we'll get the scoop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1062.8s	1062.8	 What do you think they're talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1064.7s	1064.7	 Looks like Bree has it under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1067.0s	1067.0	 Uh oh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1067.9s	1067.9	 It looks like they've called in the big boss on Bree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1072.0s	1072.0	 And Narsha and I are just going to hang out in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1075.3s	1075.3	 We're under siege.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1076.8s	1076.8	 I think Bree's telling them, hey, get out of here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1080.2s	1080.2	 I kind of was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1081.4s	1081.4	 You can't stay here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1082.7s	1082.7	 This is our spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1083.9s	1083.9	 Pretty sure that's exactly what she's saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1086.0s	1086.0	 Well, not exactly, but yeah, kind of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1089.0s	1089.0	 And he's saying, I'm going to put her right there and you just need to deal with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1093.2s	1093.2	 That is almost exactly what he said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1095.2s	1095.2	 And then she's saying, no, go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1097.3s	1097.3	 I was, but I had a reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1099.2s	1099.2	 And Veronica's all like, what's going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1103.4s	1103.4	 All right, you tell them, Bree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1105.2s	1105.2	 Now, if I know Bree, and I do, because she is a very capable and smart, strong woman,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1110.4s	1110.4	 she's probably coming back to tell me that they're moving out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1112.9s	1112.9	 and we have the entire area to ourselves once again, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1117.0s	1117.0	 What happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1117.9s	1117.9	 That's a carnival.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1119.1s	1119.1	 That's a carnival.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1120.1s	1120.1	 Yeah, and I asked them to move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1121.9s	1121.9	 And they were like, but I'm a carnival and I've been here for 15 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1124.7s	1124.7	 And I was like, well, those ladies in the office said I could ask you to move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1127.9s	1127.9	 And it seemed like they thought maybe these guys were in the wrong place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1132.2s	1132.2	 And you were just trying to help them understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1134.6s	1134.6	 Well, they were like, go tell them to move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1137.2s	1137.2	 And I was like, are you sure?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1138.7s	1138.7	 And they were really insistent that I should try this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1141.1s	1141.1	 And so I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1142.3s	1142.3	 And I accidentally made you TikTok's next big Karen by posting this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1147.1s	1147.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1147.1s	1147.1	 It has over a quarter million views.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1149.0s	1149.0	 The fairgrounds people told me to do that, I swear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1151.4s	1151.4	 I thought they were going to have enough space to give us more room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1154.1s	1154.1	 How long is the carnival going to be here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1155.8s	1155.8	 All week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1156.3s	1156.3	 So I think we're going to have to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1157.1s	1157.1	 It wasn't on the calendar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1158.7s	1158.7	 OK, so this is happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1160.3s	1160.3	 We're sleeping with the carnival.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1161.5s	1161.5	 It's a pretty novel experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1163.3s	1163.3	 Definitely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1164.2s	1164.2	 Not what I expected to be doing tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1165.9s	1165.9	 Yeah, we thought it was a good idea to go and see what was out there before it got dark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1169.1s	1169.1	 That's what those rides were about earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1171.3s	1171.3	 Oh, we all got to see this part of the wind, but we just got taken over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1176.0s	1176.0	 It appeared that at least one of these workers had a dog with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1179.7s	1179.7	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1182.8s	1182.8	 And look, we know what we're getting into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1184.5s	1184.5	 We're going to be in public an awful lot over the next many weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1187.9s	1187.9	 It's on us to protect our dogs from potentially hazardous situations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1192.3s	1192.3	 like random off leash dogs running up to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1194.5s	1194.5	 When I don't know the dog, I just pick my own dog up until I've had a chance to assess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1198.3s	1198.3	 But priority one, keep the dog safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1200.5s	1200.5	 We just got rushed by this dog over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1202.5s	1202.5	 It's OK, honey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1204.5s	1204.5	 It's like selling to a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1206.5s	1206.5	 Granted, we're in a pretty rural area, but I don't know anything about that dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1211.1s	1211.1	 Could have been the friendliest dog in the world, but.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1213.1s	1213.1	 And he was running up to Veronica, who is a snack and a half.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1216.4s	1216.4	 Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1218.8s	1218.8	 But since I don't know that, I'm not playing that game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1222.9s	1222.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1223.5s	1223.5	 You all right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1224.1s	1224.1	 That scared me a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1225.2s	1225.2	 Well, yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1226.7s	1226.7	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1227.2s	1227.2	 So after tonight, we're apparently getting evicted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1230.3s	1230.3	 Not only did they not go away, they told us we have to go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOyQYP003SU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=1233.6s	1233.6	 I'm just saying I have a lease.
