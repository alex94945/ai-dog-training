https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 It's very important to be able to get rewards to our dogs to let them know when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 doing the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=52.3s	52.3	 But a common thing that often comes up is that you don't have access to the treats.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=105.7s	105.7	 lots of situations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=110.3s	110.3	 need.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=163.2s	163.2	 First thing is if there's a known dog in your neighborhood who, say, lies in the front yard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 and then charges you every time someone walks past him, just avoid going near that dog if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=174.1s	174.1	 at all possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=175.2s	175.2	 It's also illegal in most areas, at least in America, to even allow your dog to be off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=179.9s	179.9	 lead in public.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 A stray dog needs to be in a safe area.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=194.1s	194.1	 With my own dogs, I have three border collies that I've had for many years and we practice

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 Now I know that they're not going to budge just because we practiced and proof this countless,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=249.5s	249.5	 So as the dog tries to get around me, I can pivot and move around just like that to make

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=263.6s	263.6	 by food or toys?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=270.4s	270.4	 play meaning something like a three to five seconds tug of war session or toss of a ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=275.7s	275.7	 Most all dogs are motivated by food.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 about 50% of dogs are motivated by place significant enough to teach them some pretty

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=294.1s	294.1	 So usually when someone tells me that their dog isn't motivated by food, there are two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=298.4s	298.4	 likely things going on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=318.7s	318.7	 And those things are fine from time to time, but some dogs just don't respond to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=322.5s	322.5	 Other dogs are crazy for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=323.7s	323.7	 So it really just depends on your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=325.7s	325.7	 But I would say up the quality of your reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=328.7s	328.7	 You know, like for primary training sessions, I define primary training sessions as training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=333.6s	333.6	 sessions where you sit down, you really work with your dog as opposed to more secondary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 training sessions, which are where you teach your dog in the moment or they're starting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 to get into something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 So you just get into an impromptu training session with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=346.8s	346.8	 But for primary training sessions, I usually use really tiny bits of real chicken, real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 turkey, something like that to motivate them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=354.8s	354.8	 Now, the other reason that many people make the false assumption that their dog is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=359.5s	359.5	 motivated by food is because their dog will not take food in a highly distracting situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=366.2s	366.2	 That's not to say that your dog isn't motivated by food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=369.0s	369.0	 What that means is you put them in a situation that they're not adequately prepared for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=373.5s	373.5	 Now, as you'll know from my past videos, if you're new, I encourage you to go through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=376.5s	376.5	 my playlist that I mentioned at the beginning of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=378.7s	378.7	 We have tons of examples of dogs not taking real chicken right in front of their face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=383.7s	383.7	 because they would rather get at that squirrel or see that barking dog across the street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=388.2s	388.2	 This is normal protocol in that situation is to create distance between you and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=393.2s	393.2	 and go to the last known place of compliance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=396.1s	396.1	 The way I typically test this is I'll periodically ask my dog to sit as we get farther and farther
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=401.5s	401.5	 away from the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=403.3s	403.3	 Once I get a sit at a certain distance, I now know that they're in a teachable mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=407.8s	407.8	 So I hope that makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=408.8s	408.8	 I don't want to get too much into that right now, but those are very likely the reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=412.9s	412.9	 your dog isn't motivated by food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=415.0s	415.0	 Now, I'm going to take you at your word and I'm going to say that you understand everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=418.3s	418.3	 I just said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=419.6s	419.6	 If your dog is not taking treats as part of training, this almost certainly means you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=424.3s	424.3	 have an extremely low drive dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=426.2s	426.2	 There's nothing wrong with a low drive dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=428.3s	428.3	 They're just kind of chill, you know, they're not really into training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=431.5s	431.5	 Dogs are like people and many people have the personality of like, I would just rather
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=435.3s	435.3	 sit here and do nothing right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=438.4s	438.4	 And some dogs are like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=439.8s	439.8	 So you know, dogs are not computers and we can't make them be something they are not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=445.1s	445.1	 But I encourage you to take my tips that I just gave you and I think you're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=448.7s	448.7	 be okay, Holly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=450.2s	450.2	 Let's take our next question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=451.5s	451.5	 This comes from Mir, Mirjam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=454.7s	454.7	 Something that I love most about doing these YouTube videos is just people from all over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=459.0s	459.0	 the world that you get to be introduced to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=462.3s	462.3	 So Mirjam or asks, were you once like us having no clue whatsoever to do with your first dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=470.2s	470.2	 I hope that's a yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=473.3s	473.3	 I mean, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=474.4s	474.4	 I've not always been a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=475.7s	475.7	 I know there are a lot of dog trainers out there who've been working with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=479.2s	479.2	 I didn't start working with with dogs until my 20s.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=482.6s	482.6	 So I was an adult before I became a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=484.9s	484.9	 And absolutely, I particularly I remember being very thrown off by destructive chewing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=489.9s	489.9	 and unwanted barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=493.2s	493.2	 And so those things were overwhelming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=494.7s	494.7	 I felt helpless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=495.7s	495.7	 I was like, what on earth do you do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=497.0s	497.0	 And what I found was that when I would go and ask, this is part of the reason I became
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=500.9s	500.9	 a dog trainer, actually, when I would go and ask dog trainers for assistance with something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=505.8s	505.8	 like this, I was overwhelmed by generic advice in addition to complicated advice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=515.7s	515.7	 And I think that if it if it needs to be complicated to learn how to teach a dog, then there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=522.2s	522.2	 something wrong there because it just didn't it just didn't add up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=525.1s	525.1	 It didn't feel right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=526.1s	526.1	 It's it seemed like there should have been a simpler solution to many of these issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=530.6s	530.6	 that I was dealing with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=532.2s	532.2	 And that's part of what inspires me to make dog training videos today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=535.4s	535.4	 I remember exactly how I felt that overwhelming feeling of what on earth do I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=540.2s	540.2	 So I try and always give advice in a way that is understandable to the average person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=545.7s	545.7	 As many of you know, I'm currently working on a book right now and I was writing about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=548.7s	548.7	 the value and importance of being consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=552.1s	552.1	 The beauty of consistency is this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=555.5s	555.5	 It is probably the number one most important thing to be when teaching your dog in addition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=562.4s	562.4	 to being patient and putting in time and lots of love, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=566.9s	566.9	 But the wonderful thing about consistency is that you don't need any special talents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=573.2s	573.2	 You don't need to be a good dog trainer to be consistent, to control your dog's environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=577.7s	577.7	 I kind of categorize that under being consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=580.5s	580.5	 So if you're new and you're not really good at teaching your dog and you don't really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=584.6s	584.6	 understand the fundamentals and your timing is a little bit off because you're still working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=588.2s	588.2	 on developing that, you can be consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=591.3s	591.3	 Henriette asks, what is your favorite type of dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=596.5s	596.5	 I like really high energy dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=598.1s	598.1	 I'm a dog trainer, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=599.4s	599.4	 High energy dogs allow, they're typically the easiest to teach if you know what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=604.0s	604.0	 doing and they'll typically do some of the more advanced, awesome, impressive behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=610.8s	610.8	 and tricks and all of that fun, wonderful stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=615.3s	615.3	 You know, I classify dogs basically in my own mind in three categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=619.9s	619.9	 Level one, level two and level three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=623.2s	623.2	 Now basically a level one dog is a very low key dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=628.1s	628.1	 He's happy to just lie back and chill out and do very little.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=632.7s	632.7	 Level two dogs are kind of in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=634.6s	634.6	 And of course, level three dogs are your super high energy dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=638.3s	638.3	 One of the things that's wrong is that we over stereotype and overgeneralize breeds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=642.6s	642.6	 and characteristics when in reality, the first thing we need to consider with a dog is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=648.0s	648.0	 but their energy level because the spectrum of energy levels within breeds is extremely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=653.3s	653.3	 diverse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=654.3s	654.3	 And that's going to tell you right off the bat if they're going to be a low maintenance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=657.0s	657.0	 or high maintenance dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=658.5s	658.5	 Now level three dogs are your highest maintenance dogs, meaning you got to get out there and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvCM3BQZ-0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=662.3s	662.3	 exercise with them and do a lot of work with them.
