https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 Tell me in the comments below and click thumbs up if you could use help with teaching your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=12.9s	12.9	 We'll talk about those plus I'll give you advice on ways that we can practice stay with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 distractions even if your dog is not distracted by a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=20.8s	20.8	 Gracie is this beautiful and smart papillon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=23.4s	23.4	 However she gets a bit anxious in a class setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 So I told Carrie to bring her to class early and since I know Gracie loves to fetch I encourage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=31.5s	31.5	 her to play fetch before class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=33.9s	33.9	 So if she does something she loves in an environment that she tends to get a little bit anxious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 in, she might begin to become more comfortable once she has a positive association with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 When teaching your dog not to jump on people, ask them to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 And if those front paws come up you're in between that person and you're watching your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 Put her into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 You see what she's doing there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=53.3s	53.3	 That's how you handle this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 If this is a priority for you, give your dog your undivided attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=58.9s	58.9	 All four paws need to be on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 If you detect that they're about to jump, interrupt their thought process and ask them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 to sit again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 I like that you're taking notes here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=66.6s	66.6	 I feel so important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=69.2s	69.2	 It's important that you teach stay for a period of time and stay with distance completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 independently and separate of each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=76.1s	76.1	 Say stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=77.1s	77.1	 And now get back there and reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Nice and quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 See?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 And that way he didn't have the chance to break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=84.4s	84.4	 He's half times in a row and he knows, hey, I've got to stay if I'm going to get rewarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 That was very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 Dogs become a lot less likely to listen to you the farther you get away from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 That's why we only walk away a half step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=99.2s	99.2	 We build up to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 In order to teach them to comprehend this concept, it's important that we teach it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 to them just a little bit at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=106.8s	106.8	 That ain't stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=108.6s	108.6	 Stay and get back there before he breaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 See?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=112.8s	112.8	 Saw that one coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 When your dog is consistently breaking on stay, that means you need to take a step back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 and make it a little bit easier for them to succeed a few times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 Remember, when your training is based on corrections, progress comes much slower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 Conversely, when your training is based on acknowledging when your dog is doing what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=129.7s	129.7	 you like, progress happens fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=132.7s	132.7	 And so since he failed last time, make sure you get back here this time quicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=136.4s	136.4	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 Only when your dog has a grasp on stay for a period of time and stay while you walk away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 do you begin to combine the two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 As with all things in dog training, whenever you're introducing a new concept to your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=149.9s	149.9	 make it very easy for them to succeed initially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=153.2s	153.2	 Walk away, pause briefly, and really let them know you appreciate their restraint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=163.2s	163.2	 At one point in the class, I started to use Chewy, the Pomeranian, to demonstrate stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 while distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 Since Chewy and Kaden had pretty good communication with each other, that it made more sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=179.2s	179.2	 to just talk him through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=180.5s	180.5	 Be very clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=182.7s	182.7	 Reward him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=183.7s	183.7	 Let him know you love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=184.7s	184.7	 You gotta work more on stay for duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 I don't think he's ready for stay with distractions in this environment just yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=192.1s	192.1	 As a reminder, if your dog can't stay for at least many seconds at a time, you're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=197.1s	197.1	 ready to teach stay while distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=199.3s	199.3	 But you know, some dogs aren't even distracted by toys at all, like Luke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=203.2s	203.2	 I opted to use a plastic container full of turkey to try and tempt him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 Ready?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=209.7s	209.7	 Stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=211.7s	211.7	 And look at what he's doing there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=213.5s	213.5	 That's beautiful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1DytoatZic&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=621&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 It's important to be very focused on your dog in an exercise like this because you need
