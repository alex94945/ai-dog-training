https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today's video is sponsored by PetFlow.com slash Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=3.6s	3.6	 Today I'm going to be taking some of your questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 I'll be talking about what to do if your dog is jumping all over guests,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 how to get your dog and your cat to interact nicely together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=12.4s	12.4	 what to do if your dog is barking on car rides, how to proceed if your dog doesn't love puppies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 or just generally won't listen to anything you say, or if your dog is unresponsive to treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=23.3s	23.3	 So you can see we have a lot to cover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 There are literally hundreds of thousands of you that watch these videos every month,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 and that means hundreds of thousands of different dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 No two dogs are exactly the same, and many of your dogs have different dietary needs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 PetFlow.com is extremely aware of this, which is why they have virtually every brand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=40.3s	40.3	 of dog food you can imagine, and not just over-the-counter dog food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=44.1s	44.1	 prescription dog food as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 Choose the brand of food you want and how often you want it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=49.5s	49.5	 That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=50.1s	50.1	 And another recent discovery I've made about PetFlow is you can have your heartworm prevention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=54.5s	54.5	 and your flea prevention shipped to you as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=57.1s	57.1	 So that's always there when you need it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=59.1s	59.1	 Enter code ZAC20 when you check out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 You'll receive 20% off of your first auto ship order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 I'll have all the details in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 This question comes from Ashley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=68.2s	68.2	 Ashley says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 My 10-month-old Aussie is crazy full of energy, nips and jumps constantly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=73.2s	73.2	 refuses to come when called despite all the training advice I've utilized,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 hates the cat and chases him no matter what,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=80.7s	80.7	 refuses to return the ball and release it during fetch even after I've watched your video on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=86.1s	86.1	 I need help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 Now, just a word of caution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=90.3s	90.3	 Watching my videos doesn't train your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 You actually have to apply the advice that you see in the videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=96.3s	96.3	 Of course, I'm just giving you a hard time there, Ashley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=98.4s	98.4	 I totally understand where you're coming from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=100.7s	100.7	 First, you've got to take a big step back on your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 You've got to start over because you really have to establish some good communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 You're making the biggest mistake people make,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 not controlling your dog's environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=110.9s	110.9	 giving too much freedom too early on when they haven't earned that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 If your dog is not coming back to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=115.4s	115.4	 if they're not bringing the ball back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=116.6s	116.6	 if they're not letting go,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 if they're chasing the cat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 this means you definitely do not have your dog controlled on leash or a long lead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=124.1s	124.1	 depending on what the situation dictates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=126.3s	126.3	 So your next step is getting a 30-foot lead and a regular leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 I'm assuming you have that for indoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=133.5s	133.5	 And going through my playlist and learning how to train your dog from the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 That's what you've got to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=139.4s	139.4	 Because your failure to control the environment is preventing you from making progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 So you can't skip that step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=146.4s	146.4	 So I wish you luck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=147.8s	147.8	 This is from Gracia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=149.4s	149.4	 Gracia says, how can I get my dog to greet people in a calm manner?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=152.8s	152.8	 She loves people and other dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=154.5s	154.5	 but greets them with so much excitement that it scares them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=157.7s	157.7	 Oh, and by the way, she's a 14-month-old Doberman Pinscher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=160.8s	160.8	 So you can imagine if you don't know the dog and you've got that running at you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=164.8s	164.8	 you might be a little bit guarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 The first mistake people make probably with this is not having their dog on a leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 when people come over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 You have to be able to control your dog's environment and surroundings,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 and you can't totally lose control of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 If they run directly to the door and they're jumping all over everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=180.2s	180.2	 and you're 10 feet back, well, I mean, you can't really do much there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=183.4s	183.4	 You'll want to make sure that you have all of your obedience, very tight,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=185.9s	185.9	 sit, stay, down, come, all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 And that you've started to begin proofing these in various situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=193.3s	193.3	 The last couple of videos I have have kind of really addressed this head on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=196.8s	196.8	 How to go to the next level with really building that communication with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 after the basics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=201.5s	201.5	 By having them on leash, you can more easily control how they behave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 and at least prevent them from doing the exact thing you don't want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 So there's a lot of value in that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=212.4s	212.4	 Now, to be clear, you wouldn't correct with the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 The leash is simply there to contain your dog until they settle down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=218.7s	218.7	 and you can get them into a sit, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=220.9s	220.9	 And you need to do this a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=222.3s	222.3	 I mean, this isn't something that happens in a couple of training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 Dogs have lots of energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=226.3s	226.3	 They're very enthusiastic for the most part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 It sounds like yours is especially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=230.2s	230.2	 Secondly, and I think this is going to be a theme in today's video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 as I look at these questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 Make sure you exercise your dog before people come over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=238.8s	238.8	 just before people come over to be more clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=241.4s	241.4	 So if you've got notice someone's going to be here in 10 minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=244.1s	244.1	 you should be out in the backyard playing fetch with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 as they're pulling up to the driveway to make sure that you maximize their exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 I'm going to have a video in the description that will show you very vividly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=255.9s	255.9	 how to deal with unwanted jumping, particularly on guests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=259.9s	259.9	 This next question comes from Justin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 Justin says, I recently got an eight week old corgi puppy and I have cats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=266.6s	266.6	 My cats are friendly, but want nothing to do with this puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 Is there some way that I can get them to get along together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=274.3s	274.3	 Way too many people try and rush the process of getting their new dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=278.1s	278.1	 and their other pets to just immediately get along.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=281.4s	281.4	 Make sure you keep the environment very well controlled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 That means having them on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 You might recall that I recommend having the leash tied to your belt loop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=290.8s	290.8	 or around your waist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=291.8s	291.8	 You can get longer ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 There's a lot of ways to do this, but under no circumstance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 should your dog have unrestricted access to other pets in the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=300.9s	300.9	 if you're trying to introduce them and create an ideal scenario.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 Now, again, some dogs and some cats will hit it off immediately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=306.6s	306.6	 and this is less important, but the bigger point I want you to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=309.2s	309.2	 is if you have a dog this young anyway, there are lots of other reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=314.3s	314.3	 to make sure that you have them in a controlled situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=317.0s	317.0	 So on leash, as close to 100% of the time as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 When that's unrealistic, have them in a crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=323.7s	323.7	 large enough for them, of course, and never for too long,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=326.5s	326.5	 or a puppy playpen or a puppy proofed room in the house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 but always control that environment or you are going to have very delayed results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=334.4s	334.4	 When you do decide to dedicate specific training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=337.9s	337.9	 to introducing your puppy to your cat, having them freshly exercised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=342.7s	342.7	 will give you a major leg up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=345.4s	345.4	 And of course, your puppy will need to have some basic understanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=348.5s	348.5	 of controlling their impulses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=350.2s	350.2	 I recommend that you start with the leave it, look at me combo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=353.3s	353.3	 I think that's probably the single most powerful exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=356.5s	356.5	 you can do in the first many weeks of training with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=359.3s	359.3	 I'll have a link to that video in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=361.4s	361.4	 This next question comes from Tania.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=363.6s	363.6	 Tania says, I'm having a huge problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 I have two male puppies, both rescues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=368.6s	368.6	 Good job on rescuing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=370.1s	370.1	 The younger of the two is very domineering and bullies the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=373.4s	373.4	 He growls and he wants to start fights over everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=376.7s	376.7	 I've tried getting his attention with loud noises and water, but nothing works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=381.8s	381.8	 Our older dog is stressed out and so am I.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=384.8s	384.8	 Please, can you give me some advice?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=387.3s	387.3	 This is the problem with superficial approaches too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 because you're making loud noises, presumably, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=393.8s	393.8	 pennies in a can or squirting them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=395.5s	395.5	 I assume that's what you mean by with water to try and break it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=398.2s	398.2	 I certainly don't consider it inhumane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=399.9s	399.9	 I consider it kind of a crude patch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=402.6s	402.6	 You're doing what most people do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=404.0s	404.0	 You're waiting for the undesired behavior to start to emerge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 In other words, your dog's starting to get into a spat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 to then go in and correct it and say, no, I don't like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=412.1s	412.1	 If you wait for the dog's mental state to get to that point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=417.2s	417.2	 then you're not really addressing it in time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=419.9s	419.9	 You're waiting until it happens rather than preventing it from happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=424.2s	424.2	 in the first place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=425.4s	425.4	 And really preventing it from happening is the ideal way to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=429.8s	429.8	 This means being proactive, not letting your dogs have unrestricted access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=433.8s	433.8	 to one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=434.6s	434.6	 Just because you got two puppies doesn't mean they should just play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 with each other all day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=438.2s	438.2	 Two puppies is not easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=440.2s	440.2	 It's harder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=440.7s	440.7	 It's twice the work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=441.9s	441.9	 It means you have to give them their one-on-one training time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=444.2s	444.2	 and you need to exercise them separately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=446.2s	446.2	 Almost everything needs to be done separately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=448.6s	448.6	 outside of just general social time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=450.6s	450.6	 Of course, you want them interacting only when freshly exercised for right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=454.5s	454.5	 especially since you have this problem and only under very direct supervision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=459.7s	459.7	 Make sure that you get all of their obedience quite tight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=462.2s	462.2	 This next question is from Pam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=463.7s	463.7	 Pam says, her dog has anxiety and barking in the car nonstop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=469.0s	469.0	 You're probably taking steps that are too big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=471.1s	471.1	 Usually when someone has an unruly dog in the car,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=474.6s	474.6	 it means that you're probably only putting your dog in the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=477.4s	477.4	 when it's time to go somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=478.9s	478.9	 You've likely not set up individualized training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=482.2s	482.2	 I'm going to try and give you some tips on how those training sessions should look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=485.4s	485.4	 As a general rule in dog training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=487.7s	487.7	 we can't just wait for an organic natural situation to arise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=492.2s	492.2	 to then also get in there and show our dogs exactly what we want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=496.2s	496.2	 That's more advanced training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=497.4s	497.4	 We have to first set up what we want them to do outside of those instances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=502.7s	502.7	 This means setting up dedicated training sessions in the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=506.3s	506.3	 Now, ideally, it's best to have someone drive the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=510.2s	510.2	 while you sit in the back seat with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=512.6s	512.6	 and really work on showing them how you want them to behave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=515.9s	515.9	 by rewarding them very liberally and frequently when they are quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=519.9s	519.9	 Short rides to an enjoyable place are where most of you can start on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=524.6s	524.6	 if you're struggling with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=525.9s	525.9	 That means if your dog has the association of getting in the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=528.6s	528.6	 and then frequently going to the vet or the groomer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=531.0s	531.0	 well, you can see how they would start to have some anxiety over that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=534.1s	534.1	 Exercise immediately prior to these training sessions should go a long way as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=539.5s	539.5	 Do this several times a week if possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=541.4s	541.4	 I'd say allow a couple of months to see really dramatic progress,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=544.6s	544.6	 but every dog is different on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=546.0s	546.0	 Just focus on making the car rides as enjoyable as you can,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=549.8s	549.8	 even if it means driving 10 feet, putting the car in park,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=553.4s	553.4	 getting in the back and rewarding them and doing that for an hour at a time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=557.0s	557.0	 just to get some traction on the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=559.3s	559.3	 That's the thing that you have to keep in mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=561.2s	561.2	 is that you've got to find small reasons to reward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=564.4s	564.4	 and it's pretty hard to train your dog when you're focusing on the road.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=567.9s	567.9	 Next question, I'm going to shorten this one up because it's a little long,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=570.6s	570.6	 but you'll get the gist of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=571.6s	571.6	 This is from Diana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=573.2s	573.2	 She basically says that her dog doesn't like other puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=576.8s	576.8	 Now he doesn't harm them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=577.9s	577.9	 He just tells them off when they're too boisterous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=581.0s	581.0	 It's a tough issue because every dog has their own individual personality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=585.8s	585.8	 just like some people aren't very tolerant of toddlers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=588.8s	588.8	 Some dogs aren't very tolerant of puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=591.5s	591.5	 I don't know that I would necessarily require a dog to be totally accepting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=596.2s	596.2	 and totally tolerant of every puppy that comes up to him or her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=599.8s	599.8	 I can understand that a lot of dogs don't want to be bothered with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=602.7s	602.7	 and I think that maybe what we should do as people is take that as a cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=606.1s	606.1	 that, you know what, my dog doesn't really enjoy that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=609.0s	609.0	 and really go out of our way to make sure that he or she isn't surprised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=612.8s	612.8	 by a puppy coming up to them at random.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=615.3s	615.3	 However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't work on improving this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=618.5s	618.5	 What I would recommend you do is start working with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=621.7s	621.7	 in the presence of puppies, but not so much to where puppies can run up to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=625.4s	625.4	 So in a controlled situation, perhaps outside of a dog park
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=628.6s	628.6	 or something like that where you can work on your obedience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=630.7s	630.7	 and just get your dog used to being around puppies without necessarily interacting with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=636.2s	636.2	 Part of being a good trainer is being understanding, being reasonable, and being flexible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=640.8s	640.8	 When you do have your dog in a position where you know they're likely to be around puppies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=645.6s	645.6	 thorough exercise just before these occurrences is recommended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=649.8s	649.8	 Don't have your expectations to a point where you expect them to just be tolerant of puppies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=654.0s	654.0	 jumping all over them and annoying the heck out of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=656.6s	656.6	 and expect that your older dog to just take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=659.4s	659.4	 Meet your dog halfway is what I'm trying to say here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=662.2s	662.2	 This question comes all the way from New Zealand from Jean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=666.0s	666.0	 My little year old Maltese has been badly abused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=669.8s	669.8	 Called to come with food treats and then hit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=672.6s	672.6	 She is quietly learning to trust after six months and she is ready to train,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=677.7s	677.7	 but food treats are just not interesting to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=680.9s	680.9	 I would value your thoughts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=682.5s	682.5	 First, thank you for getting your dog out of that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=685.4s	685.4	 There are so many unfortunately abused dogs out there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=688.3s	688.3	 and I think it's great when people take on a more tough dog like this to work with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=692.5s	692.5	 So I commend you for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=693.5s	693.5	 So I'm going to try and help you with this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=695.9s	695.9	 As with people, dogs personalities come in many varieties,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=699.5s	699.5	 and whether or not your dog at home was abused for the rest of you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=703.1s	703.1	 I think a lot of the advice I'm going to give you here is still valid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=706.4s	706.4	 if your dog isn't very responsive to treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=709.4s	709.4	 It's important to be understanding and really focus on steady progress over time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=713.4s	713.4	 which it sounds like you're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=714.6s	714.6	 Six months is a good chunk of time and you're starting to see progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=718.4s	718.4	 Good lesson for the rest of you to stay the course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=721.0s	721.0	 if you have a dog with heavy anxiety or a troubled past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=724.7s	724.7	 Also, make sure that you're using really good treats like tiny pieces of real meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=729.7s	729.7	 There are a lot of dogs who are very picky about the kind of treats they'll eat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=733.4s	733.4	 And even the really expensive good dog treats from the pet store
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=737.1s	737.1	 are not quite good enough for those dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=739.8s	739.8	 Since it sounds like your dog has some anxiety here, it's not all about the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=744.0s	744.0	 You know, I did a video last year sometime with a dog named Lucy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=747.4s	747.4	 You can go check out that video on my channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=749.2s	749.2	 We kind of covered that very vividly because Lucy wasn't really into treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=753.0s	753.0	 It might also help if you schedule your training sessions around meal time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=757.0s	757.0	 so that you can do your training just before meal time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=760.0s	760.0	 when they're at their hungriest and most open-minded to listening to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=763.4s	763.4	 But honestly, if you've made this kind of progress after six months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=766.6s	766.6	 and you feel like your dog has come a long way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=768.7s	768.7	 it's only a matter of time, I'm guessing, until you get to where you want to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=772.2s	772.2	 Just keep your expectations realistic and be remarkably patient and understanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=777.0s	777.0	 I don't think I need to tell you this though, Gene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=778.9s	778.9	 I get this impression from you already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=781.2s	781.2	 So stay the course is my advice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=783.8s	783.8	 You know, I'm going to include some videos right here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=786.2s	786.2	 on the bottom of the screen for you guys to look at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=788.6s	788.6	 How to introduce your dog to other pets was a really common question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=792.2s	792.2	 And stopping unwanted barking is something that a lot of you need help with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=795.8s	795.8	 So I'll have that video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=797.0s	797.0	 And of course, stopping unwanted jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=798.8s	798.8	 I think I had more requests on that than anything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keWNodCateI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=543&pp=iAQB&t=801.4s	801.4	 I'm going to put my favorite video here.
