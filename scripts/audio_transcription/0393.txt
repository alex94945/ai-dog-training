https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 Traditional crates don't exactly complement our home decor, do they Gotti?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 You certainly complement our home decor though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 The all new Omelette Fido Nook gives your dog the benefits of having their own space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=34.3s	34.3	 while looking like an actual piece of furniture that's optimized for your dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=58.8s	58.8	 This is a lot more attractive and cleaner than just having your dog's bed on the floor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=62.1s	62.1	 for example.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=64.1s	64.1	 And it gives dogs a much cozier place to hang out in which many dogs seem to prefer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 The contemporary look of the Fido Nook is certainly nicer than an average dog crate

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 It makes it a lot easier to clean too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=98.9s	98.9	 Now if you're still crate training your dog you can get this standard two door crate as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=102.3s	102.3	 an accessory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=103.3s	103.3	 Or you can use any 24 or 36 inch crate that you might already have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 You can easily slide it right in here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=111.4s	111.4	 You're just right at home in there aren't you?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=121.2s	121.2	 seem to like their crates long past puppyhood.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=126.9s	126.9	 cozy comfortable place this is a perfect option.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 have somewhere to go to when you're busy or preoccupied.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=139.4s	139.4	 you'd prefer they behave in those moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=141.5s	141.5	 For example maybe you've got company over and your dog's insisting on a little bit too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 much attention.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=152.5s	152.5	 bed in case someone doesn't want that much attention.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=157.5s	157.5	 There you go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 And the way you encourage your dog to kind of stay in a position rather than hopping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=165.4s	165.4	 up and then getting back out is to up your rate of reinforcement and give them a few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 treats every few seconds or so as they're holding in the beginning to really kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 communicate to them I like it when you stay there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 And over time as they're settled becomes more reliable you would treat less and less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 And it's important too when you're training things like this that you not wait until you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=186.4s	186.4	 in the moment when you're very busy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY3Pl2Td-7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=394&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 Now I'm going to tell them it's okay to get out.
