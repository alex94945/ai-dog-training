https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSVvv76w2ZI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=3.2s	3.2	 Uh, I've never seen anything like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSVvv76w2ZI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=5.9s	5.9	 I mean, I've seen dogs that really want to get at things or other dogs or people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSVvv76w2ZI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 and I've dealt with all those before, but a baseball that's doing nothing is just sitting on the ground?
