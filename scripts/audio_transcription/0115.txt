https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 We teach leave it because it teaches impulse control and lessons like this are great for teaching them how to think in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=10.2s	10.2	 It's also a great lesson in showing you the person how to communicate with your own dog, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=14.4s	14.4	 It's really incredible how much traction you can gain from a simple training session just like this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=19.7s	19.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=20.6s	20.6	 Initially, I want to catch her accidentally leaving a treat alone for just a fraction of a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=25.5s	25.5	 Then I'll say yes and I'll give her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=27.7s	27.7	 So yes means something as if to say I love that tiny bit of restraint you accidentally offered me just now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=36.5s	36.5	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=39.9s	39.9	 But just leaving something alone isn't really what I'm trying to teach her here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=43.9s	43.9	 Really, it's about pausing her and getting her attention on me so that I can direct her and guide her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=49.8s	49.8	 And it's a clear, easy way to introduce that concept for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFScTVwN4Iw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 And in a way that gets her to do it completely voluntarily without any physical pressure of any kind.
