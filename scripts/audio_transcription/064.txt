https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=2.8s	2.8	 If a trainer is telling you that you need to quell the behavior through some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 type of physical force, whether that be a choke chain, a prong collar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=10.7s	10.7	 or an electric collar, because what's evident about trainers like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=13.6s	13.6	 who are abundant on YouTube, is that they do not know how to train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 without physical punishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=18.3s	18.3	 I give them the benefit of the doubt by saying that surely if they knew how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 to eliminate it from their training, they would use positive reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 But usually what they say is, ah, that's not working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=27.2s	27.2	 I'm going to punishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 And that is where the mistake happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=31.1s	31.1	 What you do instead is you break that problem down into five or 10 smaller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=35.2s	35.2	 steps that are more achievable for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=37.2s	37.2	 If you can just swallow your pride and take a step back and break those into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 smaller steps, you'll climb right up that ladder super quick because every step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9akb_ihRXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=65&pp=iAQB&t=43.9s	43.9	 is easy relative to the step before.
