https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 be like, hey, I've got these cats, can I bring them to your art gallery opening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=120.7s	120.7	 They're like, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=121.7s	121.7	 People would show up in droves to see these cats pretty much not do anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=125.1s	125.1	 I was still trying to figure everything out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=127.1s	127.1	 And then I'd have all these spots where the cats just look at looking around and going,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 what do you want me to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 This is crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=132.1s	132.1	 I've never done this before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=133.1s	133.1	 I don't know what you're talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=134.1s	134.1	 And I'm like, my God, seriously, what are you talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=136.1s	136.1	 You've seen this like a million times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=137.4s	137.4	 We've done this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=138.4s	138.4	 And he's like, no, it's not ringing bells.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=139.4s	139.4	 Sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=140.9s	140.9	 I added some other animals to the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=142.9s	142.9	 And I wanted to really train animals for film and television.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=145.9s	145.9	 But I didn't get a lot of calls for alligators and binerongs and kinkajous and chinchillas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 The second most requested animal for film after the dog, the cat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 And they're notorious for being difficult to work with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 So I thought, OK, well, there's got to be a way to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=161.3s	161.3	 So I thought, I'm going to put a show together like I did with the rats all those years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=165.1s	165.1	 Maybe you could show us some of their impressive tricks and maybe give us an idea of how you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=168.5s	168.5	 taught them, just kind of the overview.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 What do you say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 Yeah, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 Charmaine is bringing out one of our rising stars, Ahi Tuna.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=175.8s	175.8	 Ahi Tuna is about five months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 So give us an idea of how you get these cats, especially such young cats, responding to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=182.1s	182.1	 you and listening to some of these really sophisticated advanced concepts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 Well, we have a target stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=186.4s	186.4	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=187.4s	187.4	 And we have a clicker and treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=188.4s	188.4	 They see this target stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 They hear a click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=190.4s	190.4	 A treat is delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=191.4s	191.4	 It really only takes like three or four times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=194.3s	194.3	 And they hear that click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 And then the treat magically falls from the sky that they're like, hey, there's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 about this stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 Well, if I touch that stick, I hear that noise and the treat falls from the sky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=203.8s	203.8	 So they pick up on that very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 So of course, they're going to want to follow this stick because it's a magical stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=210.8s	210.8	 And they hear the noise again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=211.8s	211.8	 And there's a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 Some cats I'll teach to follow the target with their nose and reward for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 And then sometimes I'll do something more paw oriented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 So if I have a cat that really likes to grab at the target stick with their paw, as opposed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 to following it with their nose, then I'm going to teach something that involves their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=230.6s	230.6	 paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=231.6s	231.6	 Oh, here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 You're doing all right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 So you just made it easier there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 Because she obviously was hesitant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=240.2s	240.2	 So you always want to set them up for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=242.9s	242.9	 Then I would bring in something that maybe was a cool thing for them to touch, like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=247.5s	247.5	 bell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=248.5s	248.5	 Oh, cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=249.5s	249.5	 I'm going to hit the target stick and then fix it so that the target stick is on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 bell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=255.7s	255.7	 Or once they understand that the click equals treat and they've learned to touch the target
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=259.8s	259.8	 stick, you take the target stick away and you just wait for them to like just make it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=263.8s	263.8	 like they touch the bell a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=265.2s	265.2	 They just touch the side of the bell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 And I'm like, well, that's pretty close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 So I'm going to reward that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=270.2s	270.2	 And anytime they make a move towards the eventual goal, I'll reward it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=274.7s	274.7	 And the next step will be to put it on a specific cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=276.7s	276.7	 And it could be something subtle where it could be a hand movement or it could be me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 turning my head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=284.2s	284.2	 Right now, because she's young and we're just trying to get her used to being in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=287.2s	287.2	 show and ringing this bell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=288.8s	288.8	 Anytime she rings this bell, she's going to get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=291.4s	291.4	 So this is where she has me trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 Oh, I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 That's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 And I mean, you can see she's enjoying herself and she's having a great time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=298.1s	298.1	 You want to keep the session short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=299.9s	299.9	 You want to keep the animal happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=300.9s	300.9	 Do you think you could show us some more tricks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=302.6s	302.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=303.6s	303.6	 We'll bring out Buggles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=304.6s	304.6	 So you just have to wait it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=306.3s	306.3	 Because her trying to hurry them will just make it slower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=311.4s	311.4	 That's so cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 And look at the hind legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 That's just amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=318.0s	318.0	 Oh, wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 And how long does it take to teach something like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=322.0s	322.0	 This took about three weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=324.2s	324.2	 That actually doesn't seem that long for something that sophisticated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=326.6s	326.6	 It's like several different behaviors put together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=330.0s	330.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 Because first you'll teach them to just walk across this and be comfortable walking across
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=334.2s	334.2	 this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=335.2s	335.2	 And then you'll want to teach them rolling this ball some, you know, like lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=338.9s	338.9	 On the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=339.9s	339.9	 Where it's like feels easy to roll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=341.4s	341.4	 And then you combine the two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=342.7s	342.7	 And rolling on the ball is even more detailed and intricate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=346.0s	346.0	 The problem with cats is they don't adapt well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 They don't like change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=349.4s	349.4	 So if I created a constantly changing environment for these cats, then it would be like it wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=353.7s	353.7	 changing because it was what they're used to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=355.8s	355.8	 We always had rescue kittens coming our way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=357.7s	357.7	 So I started training working with them and Tuna, the star of our show, I started taking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=361.1s	361.1	 her around and highlighting what she could do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=363.6s	363.6	 Any place I could take her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=364.6s	364.6	 Movie theater or friend's house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=366.4s	366.4	 Hey, can I bring over the cat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=367.4s	367.4	 And they're like, okay, yeah, weirdo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=368.6s	368.6	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=369.6s	369.6	 Bring your cat over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=370.9s	370.9	 See, socialization is the key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=373.2s	373.2	 So I just I take them everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=374.2s	374.2	 But then the show took on a whole new life of its own because I started getting involved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=377.4s	377.4	 with rescue and fostering and we found homes for 191 cats and kittens since 2009.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=381.8s	381.8	 So it's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=382.8s	382.8	 That's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=383.8s	383.8	 You're so imaginative and creative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=385.2s	385.2	 Jax is our troublemaker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=386.6s	386.6	 Kind of the wild card of the group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=388.1s	388.1	 Probably 75% of the time she does not do her trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 She would rather go out there and lavish the crowd and get petted and loved on than stay

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=399.3s	399.3	 So slick, so smooth, so impressive how she's varying the speeds too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=403.8s	403.8	 Oh, that's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=405.4s	405.4	 I've worked with this on dogs before and it's tough with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=408.8s	408.8	 I think in some ways it's a little bit easier with cats because it's kind of a natural.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=413.7s	413.7	 That's one of their skill sets is to balance on precarious places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=417.1s	417.1	 Once they figure it out, they have that lightful moment where you just see that, oh, I got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=421.6s	421.6	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=422.6s	422.6	 I got it in their eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=423.6s	423.6	 Yeah, Ali was a very weak kitten when we first got her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=426.0s	426.0	 She was very shy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=427.0s	427.0	 She really struggled at one point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=428.7s	428.7	 We didn't think she was going to make it because she was so weak and sickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RynmvcHZKlU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=432.2s	432.2	 We finally got her healthy and we started clicker training her and she just blossomed
