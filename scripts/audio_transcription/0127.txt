https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI86sUF9abA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=128&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 during the middle of a training session.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI86sUF9abA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=128&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 Right there, she's distracted by something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI86sUF9abA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=128&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 Very alert. This isn't just a yappy bark. This is a dog who sees something, the wind blowing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI86sUF9abA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=128&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 there. I'm letting her bark intentionally here to satisfy her curiosity given where we are right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI86sUF9abA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=128&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 now. Also, it could be a bear. It's so tempting to discipline barking, but keep in mind dogs need

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI86sUF9abA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=128&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 minimize unwanted barking over time. That's because if you're trying to resolve a behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI86sUF9abA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=128&pp=iAQB&t=55.5s	55.5	 you want to understand why they're barking.
