https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1.0s	1.0	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=2.0s	2.0	 See if someone actually made a kissy sound at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=4.3s	4.3	 I'm assuming it was at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 I train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 And this is my new dog, Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=10.8s	10.8	 I'm taking you along as I train her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=13.7s	13.7	 You can start from the beginning or pick up anywhere and start learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=17.5s	17.5	 Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 In this episode, Inertia will experience her first real walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=23.8s	23.8	 We'll continue working on acclimating her to the main part of the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=27.2s	27.2	 I'm going to check in and see how she's doing on getting her teeth brushed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=30.3s	30.3	 And we'll all get some tips from Trevor Smith on keeping our dogs fit and healthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=34.5s	34.5	 I'm asked about dog food all the time, and I can say that different dogs thrive on different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=38.6s	38.6	 types of food depending on a variety of factors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 But avoid being at the mercy of the big box stores.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 Often they're out of the specific formula that you want or the size bag that you want,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=48.3s	48.3	 or they don't have the specific brand that you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=50.9s	50.9	 Instead, easily set up automatic pet food delivery from PepFlo in two steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 You choose your food and tell them how often you want it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=58.8s	58.8	 And it's always there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 All of you can get $10 off your first three automatic shipments by entering code ZACH30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=65.4s	65.4	 at checkout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 That is a $30 savings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=68.2s	68.2	 I'll have a link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=69.9s	69.9	 It's a pretty exciting time now because Inertia is finally legal to go out in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=74.9s	74.9	 By legal in public, I mean she's got her vaccinations and it's safe for her to go in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=79.4s	79.4	 We live on this wonderful park here and I've been waiting to be able to take her on her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 walks out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 This is going to be her first walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=85.8s	85.8	 I'm not going to enforce too much training, but I am going to enforce wait while I open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 this gate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 I don't want her running through any doorway or anything like this without permission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=96.6s	96.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=102.6s	102.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=103.6s	103.6	 Okay, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=106.6s	106.6	 For the rest of this walk, I'm going to have very few expectations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=109.6s	109.6	 In other words, I just want Inertia to get out and explore the planet right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 Now, of course, I'll intervene if she gets into something she's not supposed to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 I'll keep her from running into the bike path and other common sense things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=121.1s	121.1	 But in general, I'm going to be pretty tolerant of her pulling, of her running right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 I'll get her some exercise going up that hill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 She'll get a lot of exposure to people out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=129.3s	129.3	 She'll get exposure to new smells, maybe even some dogs at a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 This really is a nice place to train because you can see distractions coming in the distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 We're just going to walk through the field here and let her do her thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 And you might notice too, I'm using an extra long lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=143.4s	143.4	 I'm not trying to keep her on a short leash for this particular training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=146.7s	146.7	 I want her to have room to explore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 With Inertia being so young, she's bound to see, hear, and smell things that she's never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 encountered before, like bikes, rollerbladers, people walking, other dogs out for a walk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=157.9s	157.9	 and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 How you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=159.9s	159.9	 There she sees a bike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 I appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 Oh, that's cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 She doesn't know yet that everyone doesn't want to be her friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=168.5s	168.5	 She loves you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=169.5s	169.5	 Okay, come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 And so there, I'm just going to encourage her to keep the walk going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=175.9s	175.9	 I don't want to condition her to just run up to people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 It really is a balance of letting her check things out and keeping the walk going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 Okay, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 Boy, you can see she just really wants to get out there and see what everything is all about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=196.8s	196.8	 She's pulling ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 Now, I would expect after probably just a few minutes of this, she doesn't pull quite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 as rambunctiously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=204.8s	204.8	 Right now, she's just excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 So I'm going to be tolerant of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=208.2s	208.2	 It's probably pretty faint to you guys, but there's some sirens going on in the background.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=211.6s	211.6	 I'm just going to let her react to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=213.1s	213.1	 It doesn't look like she's nervous, but I'm not going to insist that she continue on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=216.1s	216.1	 walk if she wants to pay attention to the sirens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=218.3s	218.3	 Inertia is now right at 15 weeks old, and she gets right now probably 40 minutes of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 exercise throughout the day in general of moderate exercise like walking or some fetch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=228.5s	228.5	 for five, six minutes at a time, whatever she's feeling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=231.8s	231.8	 With young dogs, it's really important to be conservative with their exercise, but you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=236.3s	236.3	 still want to give them lots of experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=238.6s	238.6	 Just take it easy when they're young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=240.5s	240.5	 Hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=242.5s	242.5	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=243.5s	243.5	 See, someone actually made a kissy sound at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=246.5s	246.5	 I'm assuming it was at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=248.5s	248.5	 I think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=249.5s	249.5	 Yeah, that would make the most sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 And she held her stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 Do you want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=254.4s	254.4	 So she is taking treats there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=255.4s	255.4	 So I'll go ahead and give her a treat right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=256.4s	256.4	 But I'm trying pretty hard to make this not too much about an obedience training lesson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=260.9s	260.9	 and more of a explore your new park kind of lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 You can see that loose leash there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=267.8s	267.8	 She's starting to relax a little bit and she gets to the end of her leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=270.6s	270.6	 See how she's looking back.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=373.6s	373.6	 She's reacting normally.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=393.6s	393.6	 The more they experience a real world settle like this, the more likely they are to behave

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=540.6s	540.6	 Canine fitness is all about strengthening your dog so that they can excel in daily activities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=544.4s	544.4	 and prevent future injuries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=545.4s	545.4	 The good thing about canine fitness and the things we're going to cover today, it's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=548.4s	548.4	 good for puppies who are still developing and of course seniors who need to stay in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=552.4s	552.4	 shape and keep limber and flexible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=554.4s	554.4	 So there are five major aspects to canine fitness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=557.0s	557.0	 What are they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=558.0s	558.0	 There is flexibility, strength, cardio, balance, and mental.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=562.0s	562.0	 Really all of the exercises that we're going to cover today combine that mental and physical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=565.7s	565.7	 element to exercising our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=567.3s	567.3	 So I'm thinking we'll start with flexibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=569.4s	569.4	 Before you start any strenuous exercise, you want to make sure you have good warm up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=572.5s	572.5	 then after you're done exercising, you want to have good cool down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=574.5s	574.5	 So these exercises are going to be good for both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=576.3s	576.3	 The first game I want to show you guys is a really simple one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=578.3s	578.3	 It's called spin and twist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=579.5s	579.5	 You're going to take your dog's nose to the rear end and spin them around like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=583.7s	583.7	 And you also want to go the other way to make sure they're flexing the other way as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=586.4s	586.4	 How does this make them more flexible?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=588.2s	588.2	 It's really helping kind of stretch out their spine and making sure that's kind of getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=592.0s	592.0	 warmed up before you start any active movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=594.0s	594.0	 So the next one is one of my favorites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=595.5s	595.5	 It's actually figure eights between your legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=597.6s	597.6	 You're going to take your dog and you're going to lure them through one part and then the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=600.4s	600.4	 other way back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=601.8s	601.8	 What's really neat about this is that you can actually change the dynamic of your stretch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=605.9s	605.9	 depending on how far apart you put your legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=608.1s	608.1	 So right now she's doing what's called collection where she's very tight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=610.7s	610.7	 But if I take my legs a little further apart, I actually get what's called a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=613.7s	613.7	 of extension.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=614.7s	614.7	 And this is more stretching the spine out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=616.3s	616.3	 So just by virtue of them learning how to weave through a tight space like that, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=619.9s	619.9	 forced to go slowly and they're also forced to use a lot of muscles, it looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=624.1s	624.1	 And then this is all helping training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=625.8s	625.8	 If you're ever going to do a sport like agility on helping them understand how to get those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=628.6s	628.6	 we pulse spins and figure eights is a warm up I do with my dog Daisy right before she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=633.2s	633.2	 runs every time in agility at 10 years old, they can start to slow down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=636.5s	636.5	 So this is actually one of the more important things to do before you run your dog and agility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=640.0s	640.0	 What else can we do to stretch our dog out and get them nice and warmed up on the theme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=643.6s	643.6	 of doing tricks with your dogs to warm them up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=645.7s	645.7	 We also can do rollover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=646.9s	646.9	 So there's different planes to warm up your dog and different ways to move your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=650.4s	650.4	 So spin did a kind of rotation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=652.1s	652.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=653.1s	653.1	 Well, leg weave did kind of a lateral movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=654.6s	654.6	 And this is also getting our dogs to do a head over shoulders movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=658.6s	658.6	 Is there anything different about a stretching rollover that we need to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=662.1s	662.1	 Or is it the same as any other rollover?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=663.9s	663.9	 That's a good point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=664.9s	664.9	 I would say that you're stretching rollovers just like anything else when warming your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=667.8s	667.8	 dog up, you want nice and slow and controlled movements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=670.4s	670.4	 You don't want your dog jerking around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=672.0s	672.0	 Once your dog is warmed up and they've exercised, you also want to make sure that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=675.7s	675.7	 cooling them down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=676.7s	676.7	 So you could do all that we've done already with the spins and figure eights and also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=681.0s	681.0	 rollover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=682.0s	682.0	 But you also can do what's called cookie stretches.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=683.6s	683.6	 You're just going to take a treat from your dog's nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=685.5s	685.5	 You're going to lure their nose to their shoulder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=687.5s	687.5	 Just twist their head a little bit, just kind of stretch out that neck and shoulder area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=690.8s	690.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=691.8s	691.8	 And have her kind of a braced up against my sides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=693.5s	693.5	 That way we're working on just one side of her body at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=696.2s	696.2	 And then we're going to go from nose to chest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=698.1s	698.1	 And this is where things are going to start to get to a point where you have to watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=700.8s	700.8	 your dog and how much they want to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=702.5s	702.5	 If your dog at any point is stopping and not wanting to take their nose all the way to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=705.6s	705.6	 their chest, your dog might not be flexible enough to get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=708.2s	708.2	 So don't force your dog to do this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=710.6s	710.6	 Make sure that you're listening and letting them choose to come back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=713.2s	713.2	 You're not taking their head physically and shoving it into their side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=716.0s	716.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=717.0s	717.0	 The best thing you could do for them is have them learn to control themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=720.4s	720.4	 Instead, you have to always lure it because more than likely if they're in control of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=723.9s	723.9	 it, they're going to make sure to take their time and not do stuff that might overstretch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=727.1s	727.1	 them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=728.1s	728.1	 You ready to cover strength next?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=729.1s	729.1	 Oh yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=730.1s	730.1	 How do we build strength with our dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=731.7s	731.7	 When we think of building strength and human fitness, we think of two major exercises,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=736.6s	736.6	 push ups and sit ups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=738.3s	738.3	 So today we're going to show you the dog version of a push up and a sit up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=741.4s	741.4	 Now we're going to do some puppy push ups and it involves a simple behavior that you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=745.3s	745.3	 already probably taught your dog and that is stand and down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=748.4s	748.4	 First we're going to get our dog into a stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=749.4s	749.4	 We're going to go from their nose to their toes and going all the way down into a down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=753.1s	753.1	 and then we're going to go back up into a stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=755.4s	755.4	 And so the dog is actually physically doing a push up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=758.1s	758.1	 The point of a push up is a full body strengthening exercise from the rear all the way to their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=762.5s	762.5	 chest and their shoulders and their back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=764.8s	764.8	 They're engaging all their muscles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=766.2s	766.2	 So push ups look solid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=767.4s	767.4	 You mentioned sit ups though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=768.6s	768.6	 Now this is going to be interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=769.8s	769.8	 It's also involving the same game of stand, but also sit to achieve this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=774.2s	774.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=775.2s	775.2	 Start your dog in a stand, ask for a sit and then after they get into a sit, you do a stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=778.7s	778.7	 So what are some ways that we can make these exercises more effective?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=781.9s	781.9	 By adding equipment, you're not only going to increase the strengthening of that exercise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=787.0s	787.0	 you're also going to add a dynamic of balance to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=789.4s	789.4	 So we have this fancy looking prop here, but if you didn't have something like this, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=792.8s	792.8	 could easily use a couch cushion or a pillow or something like that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=795.9s	795.9	 Correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=796.9s	796.9	 By keeping your front paws still like this, it actually makes the exercise a lot more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=799.3s	799.3	 effective for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=800.5s	800.5	 Having this decreased stability here really teaches dogs how to use their muscles more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=805.7s	805.7	 efficiently, effectively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=806.7s	806.7	 And you can imagine like not only is she really engaged in his core right now, but she's also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=811.0s	811.0	 building a lot of strength up in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=812.7s	812.7	 You've shown us how to use the front paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=814.3s	814.3	 What about their rear legs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=815.6s	815.6	 You can take this bone, scoot it back just a tad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=818.1s	818.1	 So that way the dog's rear paws hit this and do the exact same exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=821.3s	821.3	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=822.3s	822.3	 Oh, there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=823.3s	823.3	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=824.3s	824.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=825.3s	825.3	 And stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=826.3s	826.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=827.3s	827.3	 And then also going back to the puppy push-ups, we can go down, stand, and it looks fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=832.3s	832.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=833.3s	833.3	 With young dogs, obviously, we want to not overwork them and be pretty conservative with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=836.7s	836.7	 their exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=837.7s	837.7	 Let's see how it would work with a senior dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=839.7s	839.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=840.7s	840.7	 Whoa, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=842.0s	842.0	 I can't wait to see what you do with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=844.2s	844.2	 So once your dog has been doing equipment and they understand the puppy setups and push-ups,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=848.8s	848.8	 you can actually start designing reps and sets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=851.1s	851.1	 We don't want to do that with puppies too much because we don't want to wear them out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=853.7s	853.7	 until they're fully grown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=855.1s	855.1	 With adult dogs, we can actually start to gauge and figure out how well they're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=858.9s	858.9	 and progressing in their fitness if we can add some reps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=861.9s	861.9	 So reps being the repetitions of exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=863.9s	863.9	 So if we do a sit and then we do a stand, that is one rep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=869.5s	869.5	 And then if we ask our dog to do that sit and then stand three times in a row, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=873.9s	873.9	 can be one set of three reps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=877.2s	877.2	 Then what we do is at that point, probably take a break and let the dog kind of rest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=880.5s	880.5	 for a second and then repeat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=882.0s	882.0	 And one of the really great things, dogs are so unlikely to show us when they're uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=886.1s	886.1	 And so when you're in the habit of doing regular exercises like this, it's more likely to tune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=890.2s	890.2	 you into the more nuanced parts of how they're feeling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=893.0s	893.0	 Yeah, because if you say we're doing three reps for three sets regularly and your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=897.5s	897.5	 all of a sudden one day was not able to do even one set, you could see that your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=901.6s	901.6	 is maybe needing to go to the vet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=903.5s	903.5	 So it's a really good way for you to be very in tune with your dog physically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=906.7s	906.7	 Overall, fitness in general will help your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=908.9s	908.9	 It'll make them more conditioned and less prone to injury because they're learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=912.0s	912.0	 how to use their muscles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=913.3s	913.3	 They're also prepared for lots of different types of physical activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=916.2s	916.2	 You may also see that this could also decrease the risk of things like arthritis because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=919.8s	919.8	 their form is better and their muscles and joints are stronger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=922.7s	922.7	 One of the common questions that I know both of us are asked, getting your dog's energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=925.8s	925.8	 out, especially when they're inside and the weather is bad, can be super challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=929.7s	929.7	 So what do you recommend for that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=930.9s	930.9	 Well, we have this great game called bed to bed sprint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=933.3s	933.3	 Ah, that sounds like fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=935.1s	935.1	 So I noticed you're starting with the mats really close together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=937.7s	937.7	 Yeah, we want to make sure the dog understands how to go from one bed to the other bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=941.9s	941.9	 In the beginning of the stage here, you could take a treat and lure them from bed to bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=945.7s	945.7	 if your dog doesn't understand this quite yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=947.5s	947.5	 All right. So once they're going from bed to bed at a short distance, now I'm assuming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=951.4s	951.4	 we make them farther apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=952.3s	952.3	 Yep. So what we're going to do is we're going to start off on one bed right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=954.9s	954.9	 And at first, you may have to walk side by side with your dog just to get them going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=958.9s	958.9	 and also to gauge the speed because we're trying to get the dog's heart rate up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=962.0s	962.0	 And these are like sprints for people, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=963.8s	963.8	 I mean, this is what you do while inside you do it in short bursts, get their heart rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=967.5s	967.5	 up, but then give them plenty of time to recover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=969.4s	969.4	 And you wouldn't want to overdo something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=971.3s	971.3	 All right. So you've got a squeaky tennis ball here, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=973.7s	973.7	 Daisy's absolute favorite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=975.5s	975.5	 Yeah. So she lights up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=976.7s	976.7	 Her focus is like really on that ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=978.7s	978.7	 So let's see if this really builds her speed and intensity during this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=982.9s	982.9	 That would be the point I would imagine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=984.2s	984.2	 Right. Put in the little ball over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=986.4s	986.4	 Okay. Telling your dog, ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=988.2s	988.2	 Okay. She didn't have to go over twice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=990.8s	990.8	 There we go. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=991.9s	991.9	 A real great benefit for a senior dog like Daisy is getting those joints moving and making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=995.8s	995.8	 sure to keep them moving without having to necessarily do a one mile walk around the block.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1000.3s	1000.3	 For some senior dogs, that's really hard at an older age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1003.0s	1003.0	 And this is a very simple and short mobility exercise to keep those joints moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1007.8s	1007.8	 There's two kinds of cardio here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1009.1s	1009.1	 I mean, you have the intense kind of cardio where your dog's heart rates up for a short
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1012.7s	1012.7	 period of time like fetch and sprinting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1015.0s	1015.0	 We call that anaerobic cardio, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1016.7s	1016.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1017.0s	1017.0	 Then there's that lower intensity endurance exercise like distance walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1020.8s	1020.8	 That's an example of aerobic cardio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1022.5s	1022.5	 Both types are important for exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1024.1s	1024.1	 And you can see just in the short period of time, she's panting, she's had a healthy workout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1027.7s	1027.7	 Doing a dog gets a chance to work out even when it's bad weather outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1031.1s	1031.1	 They're going to be happier and healthier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1032.7s	1032.7	 So you're seeing here how we're hitting all of the different aspects of canine fitness,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1037.1s	1037.1	 but balance is an especially important one for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6h2RFOM5Vk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=317&pp=iAQB&t=1040.1s	1040.1	 You're too much of a pro for this.
