https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=67.5s	67.5	 He's extremely, extremely sweet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 Whenever he meets someone for the first time, it's often what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=86.3s	86.3	 He just needs a little bit of time just to get to know you and then there's a switch

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=92.5s	92.5	 I'm ready to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 We actually got him right before he made it to the SPCA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=96.4s	96.4	 So he's, we think he's a little older than three and we've had him for a little bit more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=100.8s	100.8	 than two years now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 He really is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 He's a gentle giant though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=111.2s	111.2	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=112.2s	112.2	 He is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=113.2s	113.2	 Usually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 He's about, usually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 The main issue we have is that he has really, really bad separation anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 So he hates when we leave, he's really, really attached to my husband and I.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 And we, unfortunately, whenever we go to work every day, we have to kennel him because otherwise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=130.9s	130.9	 he destroys everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 Whenever one of us leaves in the car, he's crying, trying to jump over the fence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=138.5s	138.5	 You actually put him in the kennel when you leave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 Now for some dogs with separation anxiety, that can spell disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 It depends on the dog though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=147.3s	147.3	 When he's in the kennel, does he tend to bite at the kennel or anything like that to your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=150.5s	150.5	 knowledge?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 In the past too, we've tried to put an old t-shirt in there, an old piece of clothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=155.1s	155.1	 so that he feels more comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 But then we come back and it's in a million pieces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 Oh gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=159.5s	159.5	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=160.5s	160.5	 So if you leave things in there, sometimes he'll destroy those, but he doesn't necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=163.3s	163.3	 cause himself harm while in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=165.4s	165.4	 He doesn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 He doesn't.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=169.1s	169.1	 It really just depends on the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 With a dog that is likely to cause themselves harm, we would never want to put them in a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=176.7s	176.7	 It can vary tremendously as to why certain dogs behave this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=179.9s	179.9	 Do you have any knowledge as to his past?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 We were told that with his first family, he was in the kennel for extended periods of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 time, 25 hours, 36 hours.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 I see.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 Signs of this behavior are often following you around the house or pacing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=203.7s	203.7	 Does he do anything like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 He's definitely following us more than other people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=208.2s	208.2	 He also likes to be in the same room where we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=210.8s	210.8	 So let's say we take a nap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=212.1s	212.1	 He's going to be taking a nap right next to us.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=221.1s	221.1	 If one of us leaves, he's definitely going to be at the door, barking, scratching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 He's been up in the windows to try to get out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=243.2s	243.2	 ingredient when teaching a dog other things.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 there are a lot of reasons for this, including a traumatic life experience, kind of like

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=313.3s	313.3	 What would happen if you guys drive around the block?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 Okay, wow, wow.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=351.1s	351.1	 I'm going to try and reassure him because I don't want to freak out too much here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=354.6s	354.6	 It was clear that Colston had pretty immediate effects of coping with being left alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=358.4s	358.4	 I decided to try and engage him to make him more comfortable.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=365.3s	365.3	 Trouble is I've got a busy few months and I can't be here when he's left alone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvW5D0J42so&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=374.2s	374.2	 Definitely textbook separation anxiety.
