https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 Dog agility is a fantastic way to bond with your dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 but we can all agree that it's no fun running around town
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=60.7s	60.7	 to try to find the right dog food and get your dog's food

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 Just choose your dog's food and how often you want it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=68.4s	68.4	 Enter code Zach 30 when you check out and you'll get $10 off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=71.3s	71.3	 your first three orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=72.9s	72.9	 I'll have all the details in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=75.1s	75.1	 Agility is one of those things you can do for fun in your backyard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 or you can compete, but it's also a great trust building exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=81.2s	81.2	 What's the first thing you want to show us today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=82.7s	82.7	 Well, we're probably going to go with one of the more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=84.3s	84.3	 difficult items first, which is the weave poles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=86.5s	86.5	 I think weave poles are one of the most impressive obstacles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 in all of dog agility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=90.1s	90.1	 Weave. Good girl. Look at her go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=91.8s	91.8	 Oh, nice. Look at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 It was actually a correct way and wrong way to send them in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=96.9s	96.9	 They always have to enter with their left shoulder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=98.9s	98.9	 How do you typically reward her and motivate her to want to do something like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=101.9s	101.9	 A lot of agility dogs do very well on toys because it does tap into that plate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 which is what they're doing with you on the field is playing with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 So I got Daisy a little squeaky tennis ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=110.4s	110.4	 Go, go, go, go, go, go. Look how fast she goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 There you go. Yeah. Amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=114.1s	114.1	 Daisy, weave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=115.9s	115.9	 Oh, right. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 And you can see she's so motivated to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=119.7s	119.7	 Looks like you're having a good time too, Trevor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 Yes, I am. It's a blast to do agility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 How did you go about teaching this to her?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=124.5s	124.5	 One really cool way to teach it is called channel ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=126.7s	126.7	 You can actually make a little channel here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 What actually sometimes people will even do is have their dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=130.6s	130.6	 sit, stay on one side and then call them to the other or you lure them through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=134.2s	134.2	 But you just take a treat and you lure them all the way through like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 But see how easy that was for her to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=138.7s	138.7	 So as she gets better at it, you actually squeeze them closer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 and closer together until they're back to a straight line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=143.5s	143.5	 Well, clever. We've there you go. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=146.5s	146.5	 And that's what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=147.3s	147.3	 You don't want them just to kind of meander through slowly like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=150.4s	150.4	 You kind of want them to slalom all the way through the weep pulse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=153.4s	153.4	 This is such a great skill to teach because skills like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 really help to build serious mental focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=158.4s	158.4	 Daisy is a total pro. So next we've got the tunnel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=160.9s	160.9	 I mean, this is a staple in dog agility. Go, go, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=164.9s	164.9	 Oh, back the other way. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=167.1s	167.1	 Now, this one actually looks pretty easy, but when you first start to teach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 this to many dogs, they find it to be quite intimidating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=173.6s	173.6	 Has that been your experience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 Yeah, for some dogs, it'd be quite scary because it's dark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=176.8s	176.8	 And then other dogs, they just love it so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=178.9s	178.9	 And sometimes you get what's called tunnel suck and the dog will accidentally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=181.9s	181.9	 go off course into a tunnel because it's a really fun obstacle for the dogs to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=185.5s	185.5	 Why don't you show us how you went about teaching this to Daisy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=187.7s	187.7	 As a beginner, you want to go and stretch it out to a straight line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 so they can see you on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 So you would have your friend take your dog over onto this side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=194.9s	194.9	 It's important when you're teaching this not to block the end of the tunnel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=197.6s	197.6	 So don't sit right in front of the tunnel, but off to the side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=200.1s	200.1	 And then just peek your head in and call your dog, Daisy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 Yeah, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=205.4s	205.4	 And it's a lot easier to call them to you than it is to send them away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=209.5s	209.5	 Having your dog come to you makes it as easy as possible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=212.2s	212.2	 because whenever you're teaching anything new to your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=214.5s	214.5	 you want to make it as easy as possible in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 Sometimes you may have to make it a little shorter at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=219.7s	219.7	 and then lengthen it over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=221.4s	221.4	 As your dog gets to know it better and better, you'll call it tunnel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=224.2s	224.2	 And then you can actually come on to this side over here, Daisy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=226.9s	226.9	 and just tell them tunnel and then run next to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=229.9s	229.9	 And then praise them. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=231.8s	231.8	 So now that we got it straight, it's time to curve it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=234.1s	234.1	 So the reason that you want to curve it slowly is so that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=237.3s	237.3	 if they don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=239.3s	239.3	 So exactly.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=243.1s	243.1	 We're going to start on the curve side over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=244.8s	244.8	 Daisy ready?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=250.5s	250.5	 then you curve the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=252.5s	252.5	 And now you kind of got like a noodle shape now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=254.2s	254.2	 And you always want to run on the inside of the curve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=256.3s	256.3	 That way you can beat your dog to the other side.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=264.2s	264.2	 again or a treat and reward them on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=266.6s	266.6	 And you can with the tennis ball, you can easily toss tunnel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 Don't be afraid to reward them a ton when you first teaching them,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=280.6s	280.6	 I love seizing opportunities like this to build trust with a dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=304.8s	304.8	 Safety is always the most important thing with anything we do with our dogs,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=312.9s	312.9	 where they just go from a standstill and pop over.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 We'll just put it on eight inches for Daisy down here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=329.8s	329.8	 And we're going to go ahead and put it on the other side of the jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=333.2s	333.2	 Really far out, which you want to make sure to do is whatever your dog's body

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=340.4s	340.4	 There it is. And of course, when your dog jumps over this low hurdle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=343.3s	343.3	 for the first time, you celebrate like they just cleared a six foot jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=346.0s	346.0	 When you're having fun, your dog is going to have fun, too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=352.3s	352.3	 or is having difficulty with it, just put it back down another level.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=373.2s	373.2	 Yeah, there you go. Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=377.2s	377.2	 you can actually start teaching how to jump it at an angle with the figure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3B6BNQR3o&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=379.8s	379.8	 eight exercise. Daisy, hop here.
