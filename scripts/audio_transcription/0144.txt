https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 not asking for anything. All we're trying to do is communicate

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=209.8s	209.8	 just kicked in because as she went down, I saw you do a more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 purposeful click to mark the down which was excellent timing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=227.3s	227.3	 attention getting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=229.5s	229.5	 Yes, she looked at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 Yeah, she seems to be making the connection. Usually within like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 10 or 15 or 30 clicks, they get it. Maybe 32 if you're a doxin.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 shortness of here since I asked for it so much. That's cool. She

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=311.7s	311.7	 Oh my goodness.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=318.7s	318.7	 Yeah, that's right. So it works because it is true. You do need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=322.2s	322.2	 to be conscious of extra calories with your dog. You want

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=430.6s	430.6	 like this, it really teaches you that there's so many smaller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=435.1s	435.1	 moments that you can reward, which can really get you to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=440.0s	440.0	 where you want to be faster. I like that she's crawling there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=446.8s	446.8	 what your dog is doing. So here, I just happened to have her in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=450.2s	450.2	 this position where it's easy to get her to sneak up on it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=457.6s	457.6	 teaching rollover and play dead, we're also having a first our

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=466.2s	466.2	 we're also kind of teaching her hey, following the lure like

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=472.4s	472.4	 this is how the hand signals tend to get introduced. So like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=475.5s	475.5	 you know, in the short term, I would like my hand signal to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=478.0s	478.0	 this rather than right at her mouth. But right now I got to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=481.0s	481.0	 right at her nose and encourage her to go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=491.4s	491.4	 less because she's starting to get the picture. So I don't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=494.2s	494.2	 to be like click, click, click, I can be like click, click,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=511.3s	511.3	 to differentiate when you're talking to them versus talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=514.2s	514.2	 to another person, I tend to phase it out. But there's no rule

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=539.9s	539.9	 happens all of the time. And it's just as important to know

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=675.7s	675.7	 how are you still not going to sleep? I really want to come up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=678.1s	678.1	 with her too and so I'm like, man, you just you want what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=681.0s	681.0	 want. We both want this. I know I shouldn't take you out but I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=683.6s	683.6	 really want to. I held strong and she did spend the whole night
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=687.6s	687.6	 in her crate with the exception of a potty break. I got like two

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=693.3s	693.3	 I'm going into tonight. Now I'm tired. I really love this puppy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=701.8s	701.8	 so I don't want to just make her be stressed. I want to make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=705.2s	705.2	 this is for a proactive purpose. We've been testing her during the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=708.5s	708.5	 day and she's been good for long periods at a time, several hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=712.1s	712.1	 sometimes and Zach has succeeded overnight almost flawlessly. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=717.7s	717.7	 I was like, okay, it's night three of her doing this. You've

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=763.2s	763.2	 likely to let her out as we have done liberally in the first many

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=770.7s	770.7	 really getting her to just chill. I'm not sending the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=788.1s	788.1	 scary. And something tells me as this series goes on, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=791.4s	791.4	 going to continue to be a very real challenge that we have to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=799.5s	799.5	 been tasked for the rest of the day with getting Veronica
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=804.0s	804.0	 comfortable with being in her crate or being in a controlled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=806.8s	806.8	 area, I'll say. That's really the most important thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=809.9s	809.9	 Sometimes though, when I walk away, that's when her anxiety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=813.1s	813.1	 has been arising, but it's been getting a lot better. Let's see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=816.9s	816.9	 what happens here. Let me switch the cameras. And see, this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=820.7s	820.7	 what Bri is talking about. She gets really anxious. So what I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=823.7s	823.7	 doing is I'm making sure that every time she barks like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=826.3s	826.3	 I'm not going to advance towards her rather in moments when she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=829.6s	829.6	 quiet. I'm going to walk towards her. We've been really trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=834.5s	834.5	 strike the right tempo with her. But see, the more that goes on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=843.0s	843.0	 Tougher, it makes our job. Good. And I'm only saying good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=850.8s	850.8	 because of the quiet there. And since she's still being quiet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=854.5s	854.5	 I'm going to advance towards her. I'm gonna hang out over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=857.5s	857.5	 for a second. Relax. Okay, I was really hoping she'd settle down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=861.3s	861.3	 there. But now she's sitting instead of barking at me. That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=865.1s	865.1	 an improvement. My prediction is, that's a good sign right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=870.2s	870.2	 there. Usually when she runs into the crate, she's like, ah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=873.2s	873.2	 there's stuff to do in here. And she's been lying down just for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=875.9s	875.9	 the last day or so. We'll see if this continues. But see, so far
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=879.5s	879.5	 hypothesis supported. Those outbursts kind of come in waves,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=882.9s	882.9	 and she's like, oh, yeah, I've got food over here. And again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=885.8s	885.8	 we're gonna test. She's just looked up at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=893.9s	893.9	 Alright, so perhaps I should try and do something halfway, not so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=897.8s	897.8	 far away. Good. Such a curious monkey. So I'm just gonna hang
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=903.2s	903.2	 out. I'm gonna move the bed a little bit farther away and kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=905.4s	905.4	 of find the sweet spot. See what happens. Thanks for being a good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=918.2s	918.2	 exercise. She's getting her dinner right now. Well done.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=925.8s	925.8	 returns to being good. I'm going to stand up and walk around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=930.7s	930.7	 Right there. As I stood up, she started to have another wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=933.8s	933.8	 Then I sat down. She's like, let me think better of that. She's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=937.9s	937.9	 being good. I'll stand up and kind of walk towards her. My
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=940.7s	940.7	 goal is kind of walk around in the same area here. Maybe see

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=950.1s	950.1	 Hey, I'm testing just like you guys would have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=952.7s	952.7	 I mean, really, what you're seeing here is me brainstorming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=955.5s	955.5	 on ways that I can encourage her to deescalate on her own. Now

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=965.5s	965.5	 troubleshooting common training issues like this. I'll have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=967.8s	967.8	 links in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQNgdFEWgTs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=970.5s	970.5	 Sweet girl.
