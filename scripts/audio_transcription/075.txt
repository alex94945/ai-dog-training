https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60pnVHokJI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=18.8s	18.8	 By giving the treats over and over like that, a lot of people think, oh, you're treating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60pnVHokJI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=22.4s	22.4	 your dog too much.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60pnVHokJI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 Going in public and covertly watching people train their dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60pnVHokJI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=44.8s	44.8	 The world cannot be coming to that.
