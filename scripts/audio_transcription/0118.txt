https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Lately, I've noticed a lot of pushback when it comes to my advice on preventing problem or unwanted barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=6.9s	6.9	 So the advice basically goes, if you have a dog who's barking and barking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=11.2s	11.2	 to find a minuscule, minute fraction of a moment of quiet to acknowledge,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=16.2s	16.2	 yes, I like that quiet and follow it up with a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 The criticism is that, Zach, the dog isn't going to realize that you're rewarding them for being quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 The dog is going to think, oh, barking is what made them get the reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=27.5s	27.5	 This is how nuanced dog training can be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 If you can get in there for that microsecond and say, yes, yes, now you've prolonged that period of silence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 your dog very quickly comes to realize it's not the barking that's getting me the reward, it's when I'm quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 When you're committed to training your dog in the positive reinforcement quadrant of training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=47.4s	47.4	 you have to find little ways like this to communicate to them what you do like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrDftSsH8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=52.2s	52.2	 And you would be shocked at how effective this can be without any unwanted side effects to your dog.
