https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=10.5s	10.5	 I think it's Corgis.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 Make sure you're subscribed to my channel and pick up a copy of my book, Dog Training

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 Clicker training is way simpler than you imagine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=34.1s	34.1	 This sound means, yeah, I like what you're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=37.1s	37.1	 It's a fast, accurate way to teach your dog that you like what they're doing at that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=41.3s	41.3	 exact moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=42.5s	42.5	 It just takes a sec to teach your dog that this sound means they've done something you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 wish to see repeated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 This is how you do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=49.6s	49.6	 I'm just going to click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 I'm going to wait a second and I'm going to treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=53.9s	53.9	 Today I'm using really small pieces of turkey to reward Bailey with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=57.6s	57.6	 The size of your treat should be about the size of a small pea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=60.1s	60.1	 Usually after just a few attempts of doing this, most dogs will start to make the connection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=64.4s	64.4	 Many people make the mistake of thinking that the click means that you're actually asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 your dog to do something, but actually the click should occur after your dog does something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 you like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=73.7s	73.7	 That artificial sound that the clicker makes is super clear and it's consistent every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=78.3s	78.3	 single time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 And when your dog learns that that sound equals something fun, like a treat, they'll be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 committed to training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 You'll become better at timing with practice as you click or train and that will dramatically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 accelerate your progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=90.5s	90.5	 So where do you get everything you need to click or train your dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=93.4s	93.4	 This is the perfect starter kit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=95.4s	95.4	 This is the click and play pack from the Dog on Good Clicker Company and it's got absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 everything you need to click or train your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=103.1s	103.1	 You get three styles of clickers with wristbands and these all make a different sound too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=110.1s	110.1	 Notice how this one is quieter over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=112.1s	112.1	 If your dog tends to get a little bit nervous, that one might be the one for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=115.1s	115.1	 A rapid reward pouch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=117.7s	117.7	 This is the best treat pouch on the market right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=120.1s	120.1	 Collapsible water bowls, this flying treat and tug frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 Yes, you can use this instead of food if your dog loves toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=126.9s	126.9	 A cute bandana and a nice bag to carry it all in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=129.9s	129.9	 And they also personalize many items like this shirt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=133.1s	133.1	 I love this shirt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 It really does make an awesome gift if you know anyone who's got a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 They'll even gift wrap it for you if you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 And I'll have a link in the description that'll have a special discount code, especially for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 viewers of the Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 One of my favorite tricks to teach a young dog like Bailey is how to shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=151.1s	151.1	 So we're going to see if we can get her to offer her paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 Now there are a number of ways that you can teach this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 I'll have a more detailed video in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 I'm going to go ahead and tickle the back of her paw and if she moves it, I'm going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=162.3s	162.3	 to click right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 She moved it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=164.5s	164.5	 She didn't shake yet, but she moved it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=166.1s	166.1	 So I want to mark that behavior the instant she does it with the click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=170.3s	170.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=170.9s	170.9	 She lifted it accidentally there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=172.5s	172.5	 It looked like, but that's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=173.6s	173.6	 I'm still going to click and reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=175.3s	175.3	 I don't care which foot she uses right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=177.5s	177.5	 And you might be wondering, well, what's wrong with saying good girl or good dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 There's nothing really wrong with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=182.2s	182.2	 But you'll find that your timing is going to be way better when you've got that button
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 in your hand to press the moment your dog does something you like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 Let's try the other paw and see if we have luck with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 Oh, look at that. Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 I'm going to distract her a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=195.9s	195.9	 Well, look at that right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=197.1s	197.1	 OK, so we went a different angle there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=199.8s	199.8	 And I just kind of good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=201.8s	201.8	 I just kind of put the treat at her nose as if to get her to lift up a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=206.1s	206.1	 Yes. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 And when she lifts both paws up, I still like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 But that's not what I'm teaching right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 So I'm going to ignore that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=214.8s	214.8	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=217.4s	217.4	 Shake. There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 If we continue to work on that, you'll have this down perfect in no time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=222.3s	222.3	 Let's move on to our next trick now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 Why don't we teach her how to spin around?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=225.7s	225.7	 This one's always a crowd pleaser. Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=228.6s	228.6	 Good. Nice work. Did you see what I did there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=231.1s	231.1	 I just guided her a little bit and then I clicked to let her know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=235.1s	235.1	 I like that she's doing a partial spin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=238.5s	238.5	 Look at that. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=240.1s	240.1	 Let's see if we can get her to go a little bit farther now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 Good. Really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 Look at that. Oh, she's getting this quick here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 And I'm going to just click and reward every time she makes a full circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=252.7s	252.7	 If your dog wasn't following it this quick, then you would just ease them into it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=256.9s	256.9	 and click for the little bit of progress they were offering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=260.1s	260.1	 A lot of times people ask me, well, my dog will respond to the lure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 but how do I turn that into a hand signal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=265.1s	265.1	 And that's not always so black and white.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=266.7s	266.7	 So let me see if I can give you a visual as to how to do that here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=270.3s	270.3	 So whereas we're luring here with spin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=273.5s	273.5	 we eventually want to phase that into spin like that, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=277.9s	277.9	 So we're going to try and get her into a groove.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=280.5s	280.5	 I'm going to train fast here. Good. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 Oops. Too quick that time. Look at that. There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=288.6s	288.6	 So we're starting. I'm still luring though. Good. Good. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 Good. Right there. Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 That was less of a lure and that was kind of like a partial hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=299.1s	299.1	 Look, no treat. Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=302.5s	302.5	 Yes. Spin. Kind of faked her out a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=305.4s	305.4	 She doesn't know that I don't have a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=307.2s	307.2	 but we're starting to phase in a hand signal. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=310.1s	310.1	 And the reason I'm going kind of fast here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=311.9s	311.9	 you'll find that when you get momentum like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=313.9s	313.9	 you really want to keep it going. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=316.5s	316.5	 So your dog doesn't really have a chance to think about other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=320.4s	320.4	 Yes. There was a good one. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=323.1s	323.1	 And you can see how clicker training really can speed up your progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=326.8s	326.8	 Good job. Look at the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=329.8s	329.8	 Cuddle spun up because she keeps spinning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=331.9s	331.9	 So now we're going to teach touch it, which is a really cool trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=335.0s	335.0	 I like to think of this one as a foundation trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=336.9s	336.9	 because it sets up a lot of other tricks in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=339.5s	339.5	 where you need your dog to interact with various things. It's really simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=343.6s	343.6	 I'm just going to start by letting Bailey know I've got a treat here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=347.5s	347.5	 Good. Fine. I like that she interacted with my hand right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=352.1s	352.1	 And we're just going to wait here because I think she's probably going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=355.4s	355.4	 see there's no treats on the ground there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=357.5s	357.5	 And she's, yep, there you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=358.8s	358.8	 That worked last time, so she's more likely to repeat it this time. See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=364.1s	364.1	 Touch it. You're doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=366.1s	366.1	 And I'm saying touch it just to kind of put a word to what she's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=369.4s	369.4	 So she knows what it is that I'm asking for in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=372.8s	372.8	 Touch it. Once they get it, they'll really get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=375.6s	375.6	 And you need to be there to acknowledge when they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=377.9s	377.9	 Hey, what's this? What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=379.9s	379.9	 What's my yes. Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=382.1s	382.1	 Nice work there. See if we can get touch it up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=386.1s	386.1	 Yes. Touch it over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=388.2s	388.2	 Touch it. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7pYLro5PU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 Speaking of click, click thumbs up for Bailey.
