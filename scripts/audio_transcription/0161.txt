https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Biscuits has been showing some potentially serious behaviors that we really need to address.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=6.1s	6.1	 I need to know that I can trust my own dog Inertia with this out-of-control puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 Let's just say that we are running into problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=16.3s	16.3	 I've been spending a lot of time with Biscuits lately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=18.4s	18.4	 and I've noticed that she's getting way more bratty than she was at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=24.5s	24.5	 The way she's acting is super common with puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 Yeah, it feels like they should just eat a lot of the same healthy stuff we do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 and just be great, but that is apparently not the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=32.4s	32.4	 It has never been easy to feed your dog a fresh food diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=35.7s	35.7	 Well, it kind of is now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=36.6s	36.6	 I know!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 It looks just like this, and it comes frozen, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=40.1s	40.1	 So there's several meals here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 I think the food makes her more civilized because she seems to prefer to eat it at the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 But what I'll do is I'll put like two or three of these in the refrigerator at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 I love how you don't have to prod with her to eat her vegetables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=54.2s	54.2	 They portion these out for your individual dog to the calorie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=57.7s	57.7	 They are balanced perfectly for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=60.1s	60.1	 In this beef mash recipe, you can see the beef, you can see the potatoes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 the eggs, the carrots, and the peas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 Yeah, her table manners could be better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Nom Nom's giving all of our viewers a steep discount on this to try it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=70.8s	70.8	 Half off a two-week trial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=72.1s	72.1	 So you can see what you think of it if your dog likes it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=74.2s	74.2	 I think it's a great opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=75.3s	75.3	 We'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 Interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=79.1s	79.1	 Okay, she's getting a little possessive of the frisbee there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=83.1s	83.1	 All right, we'll just continue for now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 We'll work on that later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=85.9s	85.9	 When smaller dogs like Biscuit's develop issues like defensively snapping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 to protect things they value, it's common for people to take it less seriously than they might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 with say a larger dog like Chop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=98.3s	98.3	 But it's just as important to take this behavior very seriously even with smaller dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 But with Biscuit's being a puppy and eventually going on to her forever home,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 it kind of spells disaster all over the place if this becomes an established behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 Biscuit's and I are having some down time with a chew that she really likes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=116.6s	116.6	 And it's apparent to me that this is the perfect time to work on her food guarding more directly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 Really good consistency for her to teeth on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 I'm gonna let her have it there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 I'm choosing not to risk escalating her fear here while I reassess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 Because if I get close to her at all, she tends to growl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=131.7s	131.7	 So my best guess here as to what's going on is that she's fearful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=135.4s	135.4	 She doesn't want to lose something that she values.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 So her emotional response is to fight for it, to keep it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=142.3s	142.3	 She got a little mad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 She's getting a little insecure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=144.3s	144.3	 I'm gonna let her chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 Resources are aplenty when you live with a person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 So it really is that emotion that we have to address, not the actual action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=152.8s	152.8	 So for example, many people with a resource guarding dog would feel the need to discipline them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=157.3s	157.3	 No, don't do that again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 But I think there's a much more modern way to go about this to show them that they actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 don't need to be fearful and they don't need to be fearful of you getting angry with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 Right now, all she's ever known is if I want something, I gotta take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=170.5s	170.5	 I mean, you saw the environment she was living in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 She's used to having to really assert herself to get what she wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 She was the smallest dog in that entire group and she was really holding her own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=181.2s	181.2	 Rather than just take it out, I need to maybe get her interested in this over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 I know Biscuits loves this toy we got in our pup box,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 but it appears at least at this moment she really wants that chew more than the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=195.7s	195.7	 Let me get some new turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=197.7s	197.7	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 Got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=201.8s	201.8	 All right, let's take a look at that again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=203.2s	203.2	 It's a pretty reliable way to get an item away from your pup when you have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=207.3s	207.3	 Get their attention on something extra tasty and distract them with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 But Biscuits is a quick one, so I'll have to do this pretty quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=218.5s	218.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 So the idea is to not just confront her and confirm her fears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=223.8s	223.8	 The idea is just to let her know there's no need to protect it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=227.2s	227.2	 And when she learns that I routinely give the thing she values back to her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=231.3s	231.3	 it will likely reduce her fear provided I'm very consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Another thing I can do here is just drop some treats that shows her that when a human hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=239.8s	239.8	 comes near, it often brings good things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=242.4s	242.4	 So there's no reason to bite the hand that feeds you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=246.1s	246.1	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 Before she even finishes those kibbles, I'm gonna give it right back to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=251.4s	251.4	 I resist the urge to just overpower and take the item away or pick her up and remove her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=255.9s	255.9	 And instead give her something that hopefully she likes more or at least is interested in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=260.1s	260.1	 investigating every time I approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=262.1s	262.1	 Eventually she's going to associate me with bringing things rather than taking things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=266.6s	266.6	 which ought to get her to chill out a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=269.0s	269.0	 Yeah, so like instead of seeing us coming up and being like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=272.4s	272.4	 oh no, don't take away my bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=273.7s	273.7	 She'll be like, cool, I get treats and a bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 You guys are the bomb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=276.9s	276.9	 Did you know that small dogs like Biscuits might actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=279.7s	279.7	 statistically be more likely to act aggressively like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=283.4s	283.4	 More than bigger dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=284.5s	284.5	 It has a lot to do with how we treat them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=287.4s	287.4	 When little dogs get upset, a lot of times it's easy for us to not take them that seriously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 And it seems like that may really be affecting how they react later in their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=297.5s	297.5	 Because if they're not taken seriously, then of course they escalate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=300.5s	300.5	 Yeah, I mean environment and genetics, that kind of affects our behavior all around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=305.3s	305.3	 no matter what animal you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=306.8s	306.8	 Now we don't have any control over her genetics, obviously, but we can affect her environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=311.7s	311.7	 and we can affect her mindset in this environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=314.6s	314.6	 So it's really important not to punish biting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 but a thing that I didn't realize until Zach pointed out is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=320.1s	320.1	 it's important not to punish growling almost even more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=324.2s	324.2	 Because it's like the warning sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=326.3s	326.3	 So many people hear their dog growl and they're like, no, stop that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 You're being mean, stop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=330.8s	330.8	 A growl seems like it's maybe a lot of dogs way of saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=334.4s	334.4	 hey, I'm uncomfortable, can you do something about it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=336.8s	336.8	 And so if we punish their growl,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=338.8s	338.8	 those dogs are a lot more likely to just bite out of nowhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=341.4s	341.4	 because their growl didn't work, what else are they going to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=343.5s	343.5	 Yeah, because they've been discouraged from growling and communicating their uneasiness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 We need to listen to that because growling is super stigmatized in our culture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=351.5s	351.5	 and it's nothing more in most cases than a dog just being like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=355.0s	355.0	 I'm uncomfortable about something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=356.5s	356.5	 If you're interested in that, this is my second book, I'm going to have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=359.4s	359.4	 And this is how we're going to continue to address this over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 It's not a one and done thing, takes a little bit of consistency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=364.9s	364.9	 but it's also not the type of thing that takes forever either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=367.5s	367.5	 And I've noticed too with biscuits, the moment we give her a new toy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=370.7s	370.7	 she's like, bye, I'm gone, this is mine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 Get it, there you go, bye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=375.4s	375.4	 She's going to go steal it, make sure nobody else can have it if I know biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=378.9s	378.9	 I really want to get biscuits to learn to share things politely with humans,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=382.5s	382.5	 which is pretty easy if I can get her playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 I mean, playing is the best way to gain a dog's focus, attention and respect,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 at least a dog like biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=391.3s	391.3	 You get these training cards every month with Pup Box
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=394.2s	394.2	 and I love how they give you real tips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=395.9s	395.9	 These are packed with information, two sides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=398.4s	398.4	 I mean, I love this, develop the bond.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=400.2s	400.2	 That really is the foundation that you build a good relationship on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 Pup Box gives you age specific training tips and the supplies to go with it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=411.4s	411.4	 although you do get a treat pouch with this box, which is cool,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=414.5s	414.5	 but you get like puzzle toys like this, which are really interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=417.7s	417.7	 You can put treats or even peanut butter in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=419.9s	419.9	 Look, they even include dog safe peanut butter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=422.7s	422.7	 Get 50% off your first Pup Box by going to pupbox.com slash Zach

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=433.3s	433.3	 Let's see. She's found the loophole using her size to her advantage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 And of the utmost importance to us is making sure that biscuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=443.2s	443.2	 knows how to interact appropriately with other dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=446.6s	446.6	 that she's likely to meet throughout her life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=448.6s	448.6	 With young dogs and puppies in particular,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=450.8s	450.8	 it seems to be a little bit easier to kind of put them on the right trajectory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=454.8s	454.8	 An unexpected amazing thing for me has been watching Inosha with biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=460.0s	460.0	 It's so cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=462.0s	462.0	 Yeah, it's cute. But actually, beyond that, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=464.6s	464.6	 it's really good for both dogs to understand how to interact with each other socially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=471.3s	471.3	 Particularly for biscuits, because she doesn't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=473.6s	473.6	 really any experience, to my knowledge, with older dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=476.0s	476.0	 Good job, Inosha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=479.0s	479.0	 I'm not helping you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=481.1s	481.1	 You got yourself into this mess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=483.3s	483.3	 Inosha has gotten used to rough housing with some very tough,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=486.9s	486.9	 bigger dogs, like with our other foster dogs over the last year or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=490.4s	490.4	 But she's also shown me in the past that she's great at adjusting her play style
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=495.4s	495.4	 with smaller dogs and puppies in particular.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=498.0s	498.0	 It's like she grew up with a dog trainer or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=500.6s	500.6	 Fortunately for us, having a well adjusted adult dog like Inosha has been very valuable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=506.2s	506.2	 and will be valuable here for biscuits too, to really give her those lessons,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=510.2s	510.2	 show her what's too far while also showing her when it's okay to just let loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=514.7s	514.7	 And they're really starting to begin to work that out a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=518.8s	518.8	 They're definitely letting loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=525.6s	525.6	 I love watching how she changes the way she plays, depending on which dog she's playing with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=533.1s	533.1	 Nice and gentle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=539.0s	539.0	 Nicely somersault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=541.1s	541.1	 So far, I think she's been a really good mentor for biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=544.7s	544.7	 She pushes it sometimes and she dials it back other times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=548.2s	548.2	 Both dogs can opt out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=550.4s	550.4	 Biscuits can just fit under the couch and be like, I'm done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=553.0s	553.0	 And that's kind of what she's been communicating to Inosha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=555.1s	555.1	 And Inosha seems to realize that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=556.8s	556.8	 And if Inosha starts to get annoyed by a crazy puppy, who could blame her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=560.9s	560.9	 she can easily get on the couch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=562.6s	562.6	 But ideally, I'll probably intervene if it gets too excessive on either end,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=567.2s	567.2	 just to get the dogs to chill out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=568.6s	568.6	 So don't forget about human guidance either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=570.6s	570.6	 It's not about our dogs exclusively showing another dog how to behave in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=574.4s	574.4	 We also have to monitor and keep the temperature under threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=577.7s	577.7	 Yeah, Inosha can only do so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=579.5s	579.5	 Look how Inosha really tries to entice biscuits to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=582.4s	582.4	 She gives her that gentle nudge and then she backs off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=585.4s	585.4	 She's even putting her head down right here to try and be more appealing to biscuits and less threatening, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=590.9s	590.9	 Biscuits is intrigued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=592.0s	592.0	 She's not willing to give up that toy easily, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=594.5s	594.5	 Inosha really seems to be trying to get biscuits comfortable with interacting with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=598.2s	598.2	 This is a very subdued version of Inosha's play style, which she's good at doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=602.3s	602.3	 She can get crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=603.4s	603.4	 Seemingly, she doesn't want to scare biscuits away because, let me let's face it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=607.8s	607.8	 Inosha gets a lot of value here and enjoys the playtime with biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=611.5s	611.5	 And Inosha seems to be doing her best here to say, look, I'm not going to hurt you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=615.4s	615.4	 I just have to let loose here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=617.2s	617.2	 And I know you want to do the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=619.0s	619.0	 Yeah, she's like, come on, let's go for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=620.6s	620.6	 Let's just do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=621.2s	621.2	 You can do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=621.8s	621.8	 You can take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=622.7s	622.7	 But then biscuits is like, are you going to eat me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=625.2s	625.2	 Because I don't feel like being eaten right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=629.1s	629.1	 Slowly but surely, biscuits has been becoming more confident with Inosha as they play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=633.8s	633.8	 And we're starting to see bursts now where biscuits gets up their nerve to just go for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=638.5s	638.5	 But then she's like, oh gosh, did I go too far?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=640.7s	640.7	 And then she runs away or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=642.1s	642.1	 So she's really testing the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=643.6s	643.6	 I mean, this is a great way that dogs learn their limits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=646.1s	646.1	 So I'm really encouraged by this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=647.8s	647.8	 Well, yeah, like here, as soon as biscuits starts to hesitate, you can see Inosha stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=652.0s	652.0	 I know Inosha pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=653.2s	653.2	 When I see her start to get zoomies in the presence of a dog like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=658.1s	658.1	 that tells me she's extremely encouraged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=661.0s	661.0	 that biscuits is finally starting to participate in some more rough play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=665.2s	665.2	 You can tell she's been dying to do this with biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=668.3s	668.3	 She's like, oh my god, it finally worked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=669.7s	669.7	 It might be happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=670.9s	670.9	 And I love how she's avoiding like trampling biscuits and being too rough with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=675.6s	675.6	 in order to keep the play session going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=677.6s	677.6	 She doesn't want to blow it on her end, Inosha's end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=680.3s	680.3	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=680.6s	680.6	 She's got this like explosion of excitement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=682.7s	682.7	 but she just like keeps scribbling and scrabbling like all right in front of biscuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=686.0s	686.0	 because she knows if she actually wrestles, she's going to scare her again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=689.8s	689.8	 This could be the whole episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=691.0s	691.0	 I could just watch this for 20 minutes straight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=693.0s	693.0	 It's very cute to watch Inosha try to hold back her excitement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=696.3s	696.3	 Love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=697.0s	697.0	 So biscuits confidence, it's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=699.5s	699.5	 But in some areas, she's still a little too overconfident, I suppose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=704.3s	704.3	 We're also dealing with teething and puppy biting and all of that simultaneously right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=708.5s	708.5	 So we've been leaving various toys and resources out for biscuits to play with and chew on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=715.0s	715.0	 so that she's not chewing up our furniture anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=717.4s	717.4	 But this isn't without complication either,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=719.5s	719.5	 because we've already established that she does have some natural resource guarding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=723.5s	723.5	 issues that we want to address.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=733.8s	733.8	 Yeah, me neither.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=735.0s	735.0	 Biscuits could use a little humility after all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=737.8s	737.8	 Now resource guarding food is one thing, resource guarding toys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=741.4s	741.4	 that's similar, but it's a different thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=746.2s	746.2	 A lot of these times where she's gotten super bratty with Inosha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=749.3s	749.3	 happen while you're not even there because like if you're off working or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=752.8s	752.8	 and I'm trying to watch biscuits, usually she starts to bite me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=755.8s	755.8	 and then I'm like, oh god, stop biting me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=757.4s	757.4	 And I'm giving her like one toy after another and like every texture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=760.2s	760.2	 And so then all of a sudden there are 20 toys in the living room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=763.1s	763.1	 And next thing I know, she's guarding all of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=765.5s	765.5	 Yeah, sounds like someone needs to do a better job of managing the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=770.8s	770.8	 At least I do a good job of pulling out my camera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=773.0s	773.0	 I thought I could use Inosha to help me show biscuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=775.7s	775.7	 that sometimes other dogs get the toy when I throw it too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=778.2s	778.2	 So I just did some fetch with her and like biscuits was there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=781.2s	781.2	 And at first she was jealous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=783.9s	783.9	 So basically you were just trying to get Inosha to play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=787.0s	787.0	 in the presence of biscuits with the aim of what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=790.2s	790.2	 If biscuits could see Inosha catching the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=793.3s	793.3	 and see that other dogs get it sometimes, it might just help her realize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=796.6s	796.6	 that that's like normal and okay and she doesn't need to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=799.1s	799.1	 literally every toy that ever gets thrown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=801.0s	801.0	 And did it escalate? Did anything happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=803.1s	803.1	 At first she was a normal level of jealous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=805.8s	805.8	 I wouldn't say it escalated, but then she did get more patient in the end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=808.9s	808.9	 I think it helped a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=810.0s	810.0	 Let go. Thanks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=814.4s	814.4	 That sounds really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=815.4s	815.4	 You're actually desensitizing her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=817.3s	817.3	 Did you eventually reward her with a toy though, biscuits?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=820.0s	820.0	 Yes, I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=821.6s	821.6	 I mean overall, I think that's probably a good strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=823.8s	823.8	 It shows biscuits that she can still have fun while other dogs are playing too, hopefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=828.0s	828.0	 Bri, I think you might have what it takes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=829.9s	829.9	 You're doing really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=830.9s	830.9	 I was thinking that too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=832.5s	832.5	 However, I think biscuits and I have something in common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=835.4s	835.4	 and that we both got a little overconfident today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=839.2s	839.2	 How so? What do you mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=840.6s	840.6	 I'm going to try to give biscuits a bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=843.4s	843.4	 I have a secret weapon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=845.0s	845.0	 That's my peanut butter technique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=847.2s	847.2	 Peanut butter wall has never failed me before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=849.8s	849.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=852.2s	852.2	 Be careful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=852.9s	852.9	 It's like you need like 16 hands to give a puppy a bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=855.8s	855.8	 Yeah, 16 hands would make it easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=857.9s	857.9	 In the interest of total clarity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=859.5s	859.5	 I am about to bite off more than I can chew with this puppy training thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=863.0s	863.0	 I'm hoping I didn't do any permanent damage though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=865.4s	865.4	 Yeah, I'm hoping that too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=867.0s	867.0	 That would not be good for our careers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=869.2s	869.2	 Dogs, if you're not really careful with baths,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=871.8s	871.8	 can get pretty nervous of a bath in the short term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=874.3s	874.3	 So right now I'm feeling super confident because I filmed Zach doing this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=878.6s	878.6	 a million times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=879.8s	879.8	 Let me tell you, it is not as easy as he makes it look though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=882.8s	882.8	 The one thing he said is don't let her be scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=886.0s	886.0	 So I'm going to not let her be scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=889.3s	889.3	 And I'm pretty sure food's a good way to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=892.6s	892.6	 Does that make you nervous?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=893.6s	893.6	 Can I put you in there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=895.0s	895.0	 It was super tempting to just drop her in our sink
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=897.7s	897.7	 because it's like a big sink and she's small.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=900.5s	900.5	 I could just put her in there, but I know, I remember,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=904.1s	904.1	 it is much better to convince her to do it on her own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=906.9s	906.9	 So I'm using some treats to try to get her to jump down in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=909.8s	909.8	 I'm just putting it right on the edge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=912.2s	912.2	 because I feel like even the depth of the sink is kind of making her nervous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=915.9s	915.9	 and I don't want her first feeling in there to be freaked out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=919.4s	919.4	 Look, there's yummy treats in here though, see?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=922.0s	922.0	 It's hard to blame her for being hesitant though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=924.1s	924.1	 It's a big deep sink and she's really small.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=926.6s	926.6	 It's probably not lost on her that she's up higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=929.8s	929.8	 and that the ground's farther away and that this is a unique different situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=933.9s	933.9	 Her genetics have probably served her well historically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=936.6s	936.6	 by not jumping into random holes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=938.9s	938.9	 Yeah, she doesn't have a lot of cave diving experience that I know of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=941.8s	941.8	 So I'm kind of glad you said that because I decided
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=944.2s	944.2	 that the jump down might be the scariest part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=946.2s	946.2	 And then I actually did just put her in the sink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=948.4s	948.4	 There you go, you did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=950.0s	950.0	 She found the peanut butter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=951.6s	951.6	 So she's enjoying her treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=953.7s	953.7	 I want to try trickling a little bit of water now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=961.4s	961.4	 Sure, it's not too hot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=962.5s	962.5	 Is that okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=964.9s	964.9	 She seems okay now that she's down in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=967.0s	967.0	 She's investigating it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=968.8s	968.8	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=969.8s	969.8	 I'm hoping if I let this water trickle just on the tiniest, tiniest trickle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=974.4s	974.4	 and I keep giving her treats that it'll help her start to finally get comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=978.3s	978.3	 with at least the idea of this running water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=980.8s	980.8	 So I'm going to try to trickle it on top of her for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=984.6s	984.6	 It dripped on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=986.0s	986.0	 Oh, look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=987.4s	987.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=989.2s	989.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=990.5s	990.5	 And at first she was okay, but then she started to notice it a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=994.6s	994.6	 Oh my goodness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=996.2s	996.2	 Okay, she's getting nervous now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=997.9s	997.9	 I don't want to make her any more nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=999.6s	999.6	 So I'm going to turn the water off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1001.1s	1001.1	 So she stopped taking the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1004.6s	1004.6	 I learned that means she's too nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1006.3s	1006.3	 So that's why I turned the water off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1007.8s	1007.8	 So in that case, the idea is to counter condition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1010.2s	1010.2	 That is, hopefully they continue to enjoy the peanut butter wall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1012.7s	1012.7	 or the treats in the sink while you turn the water off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1015.3s	1015.3	 and maybe turn it on for a second at a time and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1018.8s	1018.8	 But other times it's like, nope, I know exactly what you're up to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1023.2s	1023.2	 and I am no longer hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1025.0s	1025.0	 Get me out of here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1026.0s	1026.0	 And look, I mean, discomfort isn't the end of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1028.3s	1028.3	 There are a lot of health reasons to make sure our dog is clean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1031.2s	1031.2	 I really thought I was moving slowly enough too, but I slowed down even more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1035.6s	1035.6	 It felt like it wasn't possible, but apparently it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1038.0s	1038.0	 She's taking treats again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1039.0s	1039.0	 The water's running right near her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1040.9s	1040.9	 The idea was like, okay, she was nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1043.0s	1043.0	 Now she seems to have recovered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1044.2s	1044.2	 Let me see if I can keep going because you have a choice, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1046.9s	1046.9	 You can be like, okay, she's nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1048.6s	1048.6	 I'm going to save this for another time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1050.4s	1050.4	 Or you can see if you can help them work through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1052.1s	1052.1	 You're trying to work through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1053.7s	1053.7	 Yeah, I wanted to get it done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1056.9s	1056.9	 I really thought that we could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1058.2s	1058.2	 So I'm thinking if I can distract Biscuit's just one more time from this escape attempt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1062.1s	1062.1	 and get her to take a few more treats down in the sink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1064.6s	1064.6	 Maybe that would set her up a little better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1066.3s	1066.3	 I feel like this is where I went really wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1068.0s	1068.0	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1070.2s	1070.2	 Is that okay or nervous?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1072.1s	1072.1	 A little nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 Okay, okay, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1074.3s	1074.3	 Water's off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1075.4s	1075.4	 The second she felt that trickle of water, she was out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1079.4s	1079.4	 Sounds like a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1080.4s	1080.4	 There was no consoling her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1081.8s	1081.8	 So instead of doing what I hoped, I ended up ending on an even worse note than I had started with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1087.9s	1087.9	 Are you going to be okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1089.6s	1089.6	 Was that a little too scary?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1091.8s	1091.8	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1092.3s	1092.3	 Would you forgive me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1093.8s	1093.8	 You can't have that peanut butter unless you take a bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1096.5s	1096.5	 It definitely could have gone better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1098.6s	1098.6	 I think we stopped before we did any like permanent damage to her association with getting a bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1103.9s	1103.9	 So hopefully Zach will be able to remedy what happened here today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1107.5s	1107.5	 As far as I know, stopping before they get too uncomfortable is the most important thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1111.3s	1111.3	 I think I did that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1113.1s	1113.1	 I hope I didn't push it too far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc40KvgKgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=162&pp=iAQB&t=1114.7s	1114.7	 Will you ever be able to take a bath again?
