https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This is Rocco right now. He's one of the dogs here at Central Bark Doggy Daycare. He's just hanging out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 I have no idea what this video is going to be about, but hopefully we'll learn something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 The reason I like to encourage you to use the clicker is because it teaches humans to have very good timing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 When you have that button in your hand to press, the moment they do something you like, then they're going to be a lot more responsive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 We're going around to all the dogs and seeing how they're doing with the click, making sure that they understand what the click means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 Rebecca and Simon are doing a beautiful job here. You can see the nice proximity. They are nice and close to each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 Watch me. Very nice. Look at that. Go ahead and lift it up. Awesome job. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 And Moose has been a little shy in this environment, but he's opening up. He's doing a lot better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 I want you to go to the next level, taking your treat and dropping it on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 When something has movement to it, our dogs are far more likely to go after it as opposed to being set in front of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 Be prepared to cover the treat up. That's a dog using restraint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 Bloor training is a fantastic way to teach a dog something new for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 It's not good enough to teach your dogs in your house or in your living room or even in your front and back yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 If you want your dog to listen to you in all environments, you have to train in a huge variety of environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 Even moving from that corner over here is a completely new experience for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 It's important when we're working with our dogs to be understanding, to be very real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Did you see that? We're just luring him. I would click him if he didn't know lie down to let him know I like that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 Why didn't I say at and pull my hand away? He got up. You've got to communicate to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 No, that's not what I'm looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 Does she know what lie down means? Oh, okay. Well, there should be a treat at her nose and you should be luring her down, not telling her to do something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 Lots of genuine love here, which I know you guys aren't short on, but you just have to inject your training more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 The counterpart to the click or the word yes is the word no, followed by withholding of a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 So very good. I'm going to let him have a tiny piece out of my hand. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 Right there. Now, when he goes into a down, I'm going to say down just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 You can use any hand signal you want, but dogs are heavily responsive to body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 So make sure you're using your hands. Yes. Look at that moose. Does he know what sit means?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 So don't say sit. He has no idea what that means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 The first 100 times we're teaching him to sit, we don't say it until he does it. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 So sit. That's called sit. Very good. You just sat. Wonderful job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 So I talked to my dog. It's exactly. I mean, I watch right here. See it works. Very good. You're doing wonderful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 Special dog is a good dog. When our dog does not sit and they know sit, what is the next word out of our mouth?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 The word is no. That's correct. So it's never sit, sit, sit. It's sit. No. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 Your dog will learn how to sit the first time every time. If you always apply that rule, it's really natural to work with a dog when you don't try and overcomplicate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiiiF-O-zkE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=633&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 But anyway, I hope you guys like this video. Make sure you click thumbs up and leave a comment and let me know what you'd like to see in future videos or what you liked about this video.
