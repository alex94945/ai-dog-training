https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 Brittany, why did you decide to bring a new puppy into your life right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Well, we both already had two cats and we've always wanted a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=74.7s	74.7	 so this was just good timing in our lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=76.7s	76.7	 So how's he been adjusting in his first few days at home with you so far?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 I think that he's been adjusting really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 In the beginning, he would kind of stay with us at all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=84.4s	84.4	 He would only stay in the front room,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=86.1s	86.1	 but as the days go on, he just sort of runs around the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 and is getting more active with the cats and he's being bolder and more curious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=94.3s	94.3	 So we think he's doing very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=96.2s	96.2	 I'm really excited to work with Bruno and he seems like he's ready to get going too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Would you mind if I worked with him for a little bit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 Of course, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 When you first bring your new puppy, your dog, home,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=105.2s	105.2	 don't throw too much on them at one time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=107.7s	107.7	 In other words, many dogs need some time to adjust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=110.5s	110.5	 Since a strong relationship with your dog is essential,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=113.2s	113.2	 prioritize growing your bond with your dog as everything will be built on top of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 Whatever your dog's circumstances, try to understand things from their perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=121.3s	121.3	 Now, in Bruno's case, this is his very first time being away from his mom and his litter mates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=126.4s	126.4	 so he needs some serious patience and understanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=129.1s	129.1	 It's going to take months for your dog to take in this world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=131.7s	131.7	 learn our language, and understand how we expect them to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=135.3s	135.3	 Keep that at the front of your mind during that first year of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=138.1s	138.1	 If you have a young puppy like Bruno, they're still rapidly developing too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=141.8s	141.8	 Watch out for those teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 This puppy biting catches a lot of people off guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 If you need help getting through the puppy biting stage with your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 I'm going to have a video in the description of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 One of the first things you'll want to do is teach your new dog their name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=154.4s	154.4	 so that they can begin to understand that it's their attention we want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=157.9s	157.9	 when we call them by their name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=159.4s	159.4	 Bruno, come here!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 See, it's not working yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 So the first thing you want to do is just get your dog's attention on you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=165.4s	165.4	 maybe by making a little bit of a sound like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=169.7s	169.7	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=170.8s	170.8	 Right there, I'm going to reward Bruno simply because he acknowledged me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=174.3s	174.3	 But obviously, I don't want to have to name him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 We want him to understand what Bruno means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 Now I'm going to do the same thing, but this time I'm going to introduce his name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 Bruno.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=185.3s	185.3	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 Bruno.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=188.1s	188.1	 You have to be very deliberate when teaching your dog a new word,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=191.1s	191.1	 a new phrase, or something like their name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=193.2s	193.2	 See, when he acknowledged me there, I said his name so that he can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=196.2s	196.2	 begin to connect his name with paying attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 And I'm also right there to make sure that I offer him something amazing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 like this turkey, in order to make an impactful, memorable experience for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=209.5s	209.5	 And right now that he's jumping on me, I'm not even concerned with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=211.9s	211.9	 The fact that he's paying attention to me and responding to his name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=214.6s	214.6	 is far more important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=216.4s	216.4	 Bruno.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=217.1s	217.1	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 Oh, did you see his eyes just snap up to me when I said his name right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=221.3s	221.3	 He's doing really well, really quickly on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=223.6s	223.6	 Since when you're with your dog at this age, they're definitely in a supervised situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=228.6s	228.6	 You'll have lots of opportunities to reward them for giving you their attention voluntarily,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=233.8s	233.8	 or when you call their name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Really take advantage of this, catch them off guard as often as you can,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=238.7s	238.7	 and reward them heavily when they stop what they're doing to pay attention to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=242.1s	242.1	 or respond to their name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=243.3s	243.3	 Now I'm walking around here just to try and mix things up a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 so that he starts to generalize that I still want him responding to Bruno
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=250.5s	250.5	 when I'm walking around, when we're outside, and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=253.3s	253.3	 So it's important to practice these things before you expect them to associate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=257.2s	257.2	 these behaviors in general everyday life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=259.6s	259.6	 If you've gotten a new puppy, you're probably going to want to teach them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=262.1s	262.1	 how to sit pretty early on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=263.8s	263.8	 Many dogs will do this pretty instinctively,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=266.1s	266.1	 but the idea is that you can teach them how to sit specifically when you ask them to do so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=270.9s	270.9	 Sit is so important because you're going to ask them to do this time and time again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=274.7s	274.7	 So it's worth putting in the time right now to get it looking really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=278.1s	278.1	 It's easiest to teach your dog sit by luring them into position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=281.7s	281.7	 You really want to use that nose and a really good currency,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=287.3s	287.3	 But think of your dog's nose and the treat that you're using as two separate magnets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=292.6s	292.6	 At first, that magnetic attraction between their nose and the treat is kind of loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=297.4s	297.4	 If you keep the treat really close to his nose,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=299.3s	299.3	 then it's much more likely to keep his attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 See this? Look how close that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 You have to go in really slow motion if you haven't done this before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 Most people tend to go too fast like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=309.4s	309.4	 but really what you want to do is go super, super slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 Look at that. See that sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=314.8s	314.8	 This time, I'm going to introduce the word sit to him as he sits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=319.7s	319.7	 Yes, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=321.3s	321.3	 Most dogs are going to pick up on this really fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=323.5s	323.5	 So you should be able to start phasing out the lure pretty quickly on something like sit anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=327.8s	327.8	 So watch this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=328.7s	328.7	 Sit. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=330.6s	330.6	 See, he anticipated because we practiced several times in a row.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=334.3s	334.3	 Bruno.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=335.1s	335.1	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=336.3s	336.3	 Gave me his attention when I called his name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=340.0s	340.0	 Hey, that looks really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=342.8s	342.8	 Let's go for some bonus content now and see if we can teach Bruno how to lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=347.2s	347.2	 Sit. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=350.2s	350.2	 Again, we're going to do the same exact thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=352.8s	352.8	 And we're going to go nice and slow, just like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=355.9s	355.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=356.5s	356.5	 I'm going to reward there simply because he moved his front foot forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=359.7s	359.7	 I'm not going to insist that he does a complete lie down immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=362.6s	362.6	 I'm rewarding for progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=363.8s	363.8	 That's the most important thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=365.5s	365.5	 Don't be so greedy when you're introducing new behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=370.6s	370.6	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eB8IeX_cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=524&pp=iAQB&t=375.2s	375.2	 Other dogs, it might take a few minutes.
