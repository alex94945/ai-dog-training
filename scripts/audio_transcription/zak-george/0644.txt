https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I'm here at the park today and Brie had a good idea. She wanted to teach a trick today or she wanted to film a video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 So I wasn't planning on doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=7.6s	7.6	 It's a beautiful day though and I just, I don't know, there's a trick I've really been wanting to see so I wanted to film it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 And what trick is that? Tell them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 Take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 Take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=16.5s	16.5	 It's so cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=17.3s	17.3	 It really is. I know. Venus does it really well. But Venus already knows how to take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 So I thought I would try something a little bit different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=25.6s	25.6	 I have some cheese in the car from teaching another dog that we were working with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 And I was thinking that if I use cheese instead of a frisbee to simulate what it's like to teach a dog to take a bow, I think that would be really effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 The reason for that is, is I'm not going to tell her what trick that we're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=43.3s	43.3	 So I'm going to basically have Venus try and relearn it again. I don't know if it's going to work or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 It's fun to watch her brainstorm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 In today's video, I'm going to show you how to teach your dog a trick called bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=52.8s	52.8	 And I'm actually going to use food today because I think for most dogs, this is the best way to teach it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 And Venus happens to be a dual currency dog, meaning she'll work for both play and food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 Okay, I'll just give it to you. Just because I love you that much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=65.7s	65.7	 Really, this is just an exercise in luring your dog into the position that you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 I'm going to use clicker training today as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=73.3s	73.3	 If you don't know what clicker training is, check the description for the video that explains it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 All right. So notice I'm luring her here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 I'm going to click her because I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 And again, I'm just trying to show you what you're going to encounter with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 Hey, Venus, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 She just went to go get the frisbee, but don't worry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=88.7s	88.7	 Don't worry. Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 It's okay. You're doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=91.1s	91.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=92.1s	92.1	 So you see how interested she is in this one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=95.3s	95.3	 The reason I'm clicking there is because I like that she's trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 Yes. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=100.9s	100.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 That's okay. She lied down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=104.4s	104.4	 I like that she's trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=105.8s	105.8	 That's what most dogs will do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=106.8s	106.8	 Don't be discouraged by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=108.3s	108.3	 But one thing that you can do is kind of put your arm under their belly to support them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=112.1s	112.1	 So if they do start to go in or down, you're in a position to catch them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=115.4s	115.4	 Remember, we're going to say bow when she hits that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=119.7s	119.7	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=120.5s	120.5	 Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=121.2s	121.2	 It was a half a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=122.1s	122.1	 She's on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 Venus, you're doing a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=125.5s	125.5	 Okay. What are you saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=126.3s	126.3	 You're saying you want the frisbee instead?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 Okay. Come on over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 Look, we're learning a trick though, Venus. Bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 Oh, that's all I had to do was give her a frisbee and she's willing to do the trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=136.6s	136.6	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=137.1s	137.1	 Come here, Venus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 All right. So you know what? Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=140.7s	140.7	 She likes the cheese. She appreciates it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=142.8s	142.8	 But she went and got the frisbee as if to say, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 I'd rather work with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=145.9s	145.9	 I'm going to listen to my dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=147.2s	147.2	 If this is what she wants to work for, I'm happy to play with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=150.1s	150.1	 In all seriousness, it does take a little bit of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=152.5s	152.5	 but this is one of those tricks that I would definitely say is a pretty easy one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=156.1s	156.1	 So I think that's a huge thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=157.7s	157.7	 The huge lesson from today's video is that you want to use your dog's currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 I can't tell you how many times I see people insisting on using food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=167.9s	167.9	 when they have a dog that loves to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=170.2s	170.2	 Take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 And it's really that simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=173.5s	173.5	 Good job, girl. Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=177.8s	177.8	 I think the other two guys are ready to play as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=179.9s	179.9	 Lots more videos coming in the future as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 YouTube.com slash Zach George.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=191.1s	191.1	 Lots of fun, isn't it, Bree?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=192.3s	192.3	 Super fun.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=202.4s	202.4	 Can we do that one next?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 Yeah, we'll do that in another video maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qszx6laEzoU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=645&pp=iAQB&t=205.2s	205.2	 Awesome.
