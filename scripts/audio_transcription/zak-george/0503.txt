https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 Time is one of the most important factors when it comes to teaching a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=20.5s	20.5	 Skip the lines, stay out of traffic, and get your dog food online with Pet Flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 Choose your dog's food and how often you want it to arrive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=27.6s	27.6	 You can edit your delivery schedule at any time for any reason at all.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=36.5s	36.5	 By supporting forward-thinking companies like Pet Flow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=38.9s	38.9	 you're also supporting modern ethical dog training too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=42.1s	42.1	 The breed of your dog is far from the most important consideration when it comes to teaching them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 Now don't get me wrong, their genetics are certainly important,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=49.1s	49.1	 but connecting with them as an individual is by far the most important thing you need to keep in mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=54.8s	54.8	 when teaching any dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 I've seen high-energy labs, goofy labs, super intense labs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=59.3s	59.3	 but remember there is no one-size-fits-all approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=62.1s	62.1	 I'm committed to showing you how to work with all kinds of different dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 so let's find out what Bailey is all about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 It's important, especially if you've got a young dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=69.9s	69.9	 to introduce this concept of walking nicely on a leash in a very controlled environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=75.8s	75.8	 So I'm curious to see how Bailey is doing on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=78.3s	78.3	 Can I get her attention on me while on leash while in this setting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=82.2s	82.2	 Right now she knows I've got Turkey here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=84.4s	84.4	 so she's really paying attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=85.9s	85.9	 I think we're going to be in good shape on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=87.6s	87.6	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=88.1s	88.1	 Come here, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=90.1s	90.1	 Yes, good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=91.4s	91.4	 Good, and notice there's no tension on the leash here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 That's the goal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=94.5s	94.5	 I'm just going to kind of go back and forth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=96.6s	96.6	 and I mean you got to love how she's looking at me here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=99.8s	99.8	 Look at those eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 We give her a tiny piece of meat there to let her know that I love that she's paying attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=105.3s	105.3	 but you know she's not jumping on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=106.8s	106.8	 She's not jumping all around, lunging ahead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 or doing anything that would be considered undesirable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 She's paying attention to me while on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 That is the goal of this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=116.3s	116.3	 Okay, see right there she started not to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 If your dog starts to do that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 the thing you would want to do is get their attention on you like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=122.7s	122.7	 Bailey, there you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=124.2s	124.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=125.4s	125.4	 See, so much easier to do in an indoor environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 If you were outside and your dog wasn't used to being outside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 then they might get really distracted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=133.9s	133.9	 and you might get really frustrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 So this has to be super solid right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 Come on, let's go this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=140.3s	140.3	 And for extra credit, how about you give me a sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=144.2s	144.2	 Oh, you're awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=145.6s	145.6	 Five month old dog, isn't she doing great?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=147.8s	147.8	 Of course, you're likely to encounter distractions in the real world as well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 which is why we've got to teach our dogs how to resist distractions before we take them out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 Teaching your dog to leave a treat alone is one of the easiest ways to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=159.8s	159.8	 get them to exercise some basic self-control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=162.8s	162.8	 I mean, if your dog can't leave a treat alone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=164.7s	164.7	 you can't expect them to listen to you out in the world with all these strange smells,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=168.7s	168.7	 and funny animals running around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 There's all sorts of things you have to prepare them for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 This is way easier than you might think, and it's such a powerful exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 I'm going to show her the meat, but this time I'm going to close my hand when she goes for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 And when she shows some manners just like that right there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=183.7s	183.7	 I'm going to give her a tiny piece to let her know that I like that she wasn't so pushy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=187.4s	187.4	 and that she was also, you know, resisting this urge to go after something she wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 This is called basic impulse control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=194.1s	194.1	 The goal here is to be able to hold this meat out in front of her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=197.2s	197.2	 without having to close my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 I mean, just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=210.1s	210.1	 That's pretty amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=211.3s	211.3	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=212.7s	212.7	 So your dog has to be able to leave a treat alone before you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=215.8s	215.8	 expect them to behave ideally on a leash while taking a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=218.8s	218.8	 This is something you can work on in your spare time anytime you feel like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 In fact, the more often you catch your dog off guard with this while you're just hanging out at home,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 the more likely it is that your training is going to stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 So far we've done some basic puppy leash training, some puppy distraction training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 I'd like to see how Bailey is doing on lie down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=236.4s	236.4	 because that's a really important skill that most dogs should learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 Oh, she doesn't know lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=241.2s	241.2	 How interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=242.1s	242.1	 So we're going to put her into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 I'm going to lure her by using her nose right there like you've seen me do a lot before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=248.7s	248.7	 But see, every dog is a little bit different on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=250.8s	250.8	 She doesn't go right into the down like you might expect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=254.3s	254.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=256.2s	256.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=256.7s	256.7	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 I'm going to reward any.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=259.5s	259.5	 Oops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=259.9s	259.9	 I'm going to pull away right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=261.1s	261.1	 The moment she goes wrong, where she went wrong,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=263.8s	263.8	 they always picking her butt up off the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=265.5s	265.5	 So I want to let her know, don't do that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 In this case, the unpleasant consequence is the treat going away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=272.5s	272.5	 That's as severe as you need to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=274.3s	274.3	 Since she's done this a couple of times now and she's kind of at a roadblock,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=277.6s	277.6	 I'm going to reward her for just a tiny bit of progress to see if we can do that to get us through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=282.1s	282.1	 It's a fine line when you're teaching things like this between frustrating them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=285.8s	285.8	 and kind of holding back and not rewarding them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=287.7s	287.7	 So you kind of have to walk that line and that balance really carefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=290.7s	290.7	 Right now, I don't think she's getting too frustrated, but I think we're getting close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=293.7s	293.7	 And I'd like to avoid that because I want her to have a positive association with learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=299.9s	299.9	 Yes, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=300.9s	300.9	 She started to commit just a little bit more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=302.7s	302.7	 I don't want to be too greedy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 So I'm going to reward for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 And yeah, a little more there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=308.4s	308.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=311.2s	311.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=311.5s	311.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=311.7s	311.7	 That was so close right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=313.1s	313.1	 Did you see how she almost committed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=314.7s	314.7	 With her, I'm having to get all sorts of creative with my lore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=317.5s	317.5	 So rather than just coming down like a traditional lore like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=321.1s	321.1	 I'm having, if you watch my wrist here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=323.3s	323.3	 you can see I'm having to kind of twist it back a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=325.8s	325.8	 to get her to get in all sorts of weird positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 Going slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 It's almost yes right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=337.9s	337.9	 Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=338.8s	338.8	 Isn't that great?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=340.3s	340.3	 Really good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=343.5s	343.5	 You're doing great.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9PMD0z4R6w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=504&pp=iAQB&t=347.9s	347.9	 hey, look what happens when you're down here.
