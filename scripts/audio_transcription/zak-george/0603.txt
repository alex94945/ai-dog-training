https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=8.2s	8.2	 Tell me in the comments below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=12.5s	12.5	 So maybe you've decided you want to sign up for dog training classes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=15.7s	15.7	 Maybe you've gotten a new dog or you just want to refresh your course, but there's so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 many dog training classes out there to choose from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=22.3s	22.3	 How do you know which one is right for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 In this video, I'm going to take a question from someone on Facebook who asked about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=28.8s	28.8	 question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 I'm also going to give you some general advice on how to choose the best dog training class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=34.4s	34.4	 So this question comes from Facebook from Kelly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 She says, Hi, I went to my first puppy class today, but I think it has made my puppy very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=41.2s	41.2	 nervous of dogs as there were dogs with muzzles and he was jumped on by one of the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 And for the remainder of the class, he was very reluctant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=48.2s	48.2	 Normally, he's all for seeing new dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 Is this what you should expect to see in a puppy class?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=53.6s	53.6	 I think it's a great question, Kelly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 Thank you for submitting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=57.1s	57.1	 First, understand it's normal for our dogs to act very differently in a puppy class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=62.8s	62.8	 Now not all dogs will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=64.7s	64.7	 And that can be on either end of the spectrum because sometimes they'll be way out of character.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=69.3s	69.3	 Sometimes they'll be fully in character, if you know what I mean, for those of you that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 have a very hyper playful dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 So you have to be very understanding of the environment, especially the first couple of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 times you take them to class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=81.4s	81.4	 Think back to the first day of school and how you may have felt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=84.4s	84.4	 So if your dog is generally pretty mild mannered and then they tend to get nervous in public,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=88.9s	88.9	 be understanding of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 You can work through it, but just be patient with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=92.7s	92.7	 On the other end of the spectrum, if you have a dog who's super crazy, they might be extra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=96.7s	96.7	 amped up when coming to class and just act totally crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=100.3s	100.3	 Now I can only speak for myself on this, but I know on the first day of my classes, I actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=104.1s	104.1	 have people come without their dogs on the very first session so that we can all get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 on the same page, make sure we have the proper mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=111.2s	111.2	 And I also take that opportunity to address a lot of unwanted and destructive behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=115.3s	115.3	 that a lot of people with dogs are going through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 I'm very strict in my classes about having dogs interact during class or before class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=122.5s	122.5	 until I've had a chance to really evaluate all of them and see how they behave in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=126.4s	126.4	 setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=127.7s	127.7	 The last thing you want to do is throw your dog into a new environment with new dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 with new people, with new smells, with new sounds, and ask them to just be normal and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=137.7s	137.7	 be good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=139.7s	139.7	 And it can really set them off in some cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=142.2s	142.2	 So it's important to keep control of your dog and to not have them go and interact with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 each other constantly, at least not at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=150.2s	150.2	 Now socialization is a big deal and dogs should socialize with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 So typically after my class, I let people have their dogs interact, you know, after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 class is over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 The other thing you said is that there were dogs wearing muzzles in the class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=163.7s	163.7	 So that that's a bit of a red flag to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=165.9s	165.9	 Again, I don't know the context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=167.2s	167.2	 I don't know exactly what's going on in the class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 But in general, I know that in my class, I don't allow dogs with severe reactivity issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 or severe aggression issues to even come to class because that is not the setting for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=181.1s	181.1	 You don't just want to hope for the best and focus on obedience when your dog has this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=185.7s	185.7	 major underlying issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=187.1s	187.1	 So I reserve clients like that for private classes where you can really ease them into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 it and really work with them in a very delicate manner because you have to be very, very dialed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=196.5s	196.5	 in when trying to resolve issues like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=199.2s	199.2	 So let me give you some general advice on how to choose the best class for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=202.9s	202.9	 Now, largely speaking, there are two main types of group dog training classes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 There are classes that are positive reinforcement training, and then there are classes that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=212.2s	212.2	 rely on more traditional approaches and they will usually require you to use a metal collar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=218.3s	218.3	 usually a choke chain or a pinch collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=220.9s	220.9	 And in some extreme cases, we're seeing more businesses gravitate towards these E-collars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=227.1s	227.1	 which are a politically correct way to say a shock collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=231.2s	231.2	 Now, it's my view that all three of these should be avoided at all costs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 This is no way to start off your relationship and to start off training with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=240.8s	240.8	 This doesn't suggest any type of mutual trust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 It's a very one-sided point of view when teaching a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=246.6s	246.6	 And the best way to get the best results when teaching a dog is to train with empathy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=251.5s	251.5	 and patience and understanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 To be clear, the only type of training you should use with your dog is positive reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 Now, beware of the trainer who says he's a positive reinforcement trainer, but yet he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=263.4s	263.4	 still uses the choke chain or the prong collar or the shock collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=266.9s	266.9	 The term positive reinforcement has become very popular nowadays, so virtually every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 trainer out there will say that they are a positive reinforcement trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 However, a lot of them don't fully get what that means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=279.1s	279.1	 In other words, they might still correct with a leash and pop on the leash when their dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=283.2s	283.2	 pulls or stand on the leash to make their dog lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=287.6s	287.6	 And then they may occasionally throw a treat at their dog or give them a pat on the head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=291.1s	291.1	 and call that positive reinforcement training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=293.5s	293.5	 The fastest way to find out if a trainer is for you is ask them what type of collar you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=297.5s	297.5	 should use during class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=299.2s	299.2	 If they insist that you use a choke chain or prong collar or a shock collar, don't give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=305.1s	305.1	 them your money, run the other way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=310.9s	310.9	 I obviously have come down very hard on the choke chain trainers and the pinch collar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 trainers in the past.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 be very kind and understanding with our dogs, not only because it's the right thing to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=324.3s	324.3	 but will also yield the fastest results and it will produce the most meaningful results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=330.3s	330.3	 Now, if you're an individual out there who's using these methods, believe me, I understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ufB2-nw9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=604&pp=iAQB&t=334.9s	334.9	 why you're doing it.
