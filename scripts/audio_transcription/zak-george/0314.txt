https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1061.6s	1061.6	 it right now. Sit. Yes. Alright. Good. Look at me. Good. So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1068.2s	1068.2	 good bit more responsive. Leave it alone. Look at me. Yes. Very

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1080.2s	1080.2	 So, that's there's no way she would have been this focused to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1084.9s	1084.9	 do this type of trick just one hour ago. Okay. Good job. Nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1088.4s	1088.4	 work. Bottom line, she's done much better now than she would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1091.8s	1091.8	 have an hour ago. This just illustrates the point that that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1094.4s	1094.4	 low level exposure over time is what's required to get your dog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1100.5s	1100.5	 Bri and I would like to go grocery shopping. Of course,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1102.8s	1102.8	 with having a young puppy like inertia, leaving them home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1105.8s	1105.8	 alone is always a little bit stressful and you wanna prepare

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1111.7s	1111.7	 her mood. Sometimes she's great but very often the second she

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1120.4s	1120.4	 on here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1123.7s	1123.7	 You can see that anxiety is still present the moment I walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1127.3s	1127.3	 out of the door. This is extremely normal for puppies and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1130.6s	1130.6	 patience is required. Now, if we just leave right now, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1133.8s	1133.8	 type of whining and crying would likely continue indefinitely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1136.8s	1136.8	 until we return. Let's cover the proper protocol to implement

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1153.5s	1153.5	 example, right now, she's in a pretty settled mindset, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1157.0s	1157.0	 seems. I'm gonna go over here. I'm gonna sit down, get some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1160.8s	1160.8	 work done and she's generally pretty good when I do that. So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1164.3s	1164.3	 I'll be over here answering emails and doing YouTube and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1167.5s	1167.5	 all that good stuff. There's a little anxiety there but she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1170.1s	1170.1	 generally pretty good and there she is hitting her settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1172.6s	1172.6	 Pretty decent behavior there. Can't complain. She's also very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1175.9s	1175.9	 good when I go out of sight for short periods of time. So, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1179.9s	1179.9	 walking over here. She can't see me and she tends to behave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1183.4s	1183.4	 really well in these circumstances. So, that's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1186.8s	1186.8	 Overnight, she's very good. This is where she spends the night
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1190.1s	1190.1	 for a good eight hours and she may have an occasional outburst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1193.7s	1193.7	 overnight but generally, that subsides very quickly but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1196.4s	1196.4	 leaving the house for longer periods of time is a little

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1225.5s	1225.5	 keeping your dog mentally stimulated is not optional. You

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQanoO1vug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=315&pp=iAQB&t=1232.3s	1232.3	 basic training just before you gotta go somewhere those first
