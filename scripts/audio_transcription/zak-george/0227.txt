https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=272.1s	272.1	 Now of course, you can give some genuine heartfelt encouragement and praise here along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=277.4s	277.4	 Let's see how that rollover is looking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=280.5s	280.5	 Roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=281.5s	281.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=282.5s	282.5	 We're going to teach her something brand new using the clicker in just a second so I can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=285.2s	285.2	 show you how that would look as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=287.5s	287.5	 But for now, what have we done?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=288.7s	288.7	 We've conditioned her to the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 We've clicked and given her a treat every time that we make the sound so she understands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 We've shown her that, hey, when you sit or comply with a request, the clicker is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=298.9s	298.9	 to go off and you're going to get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 I'll take that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=303.0s	303.0	 Love the compliance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=304.0s	304.0	 Now it's important to remember what the clicker is not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=305.8s	305.8	 It's not a button to call your dog even though that may work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=308.8s	308.8	 We don't want to rely on that because it's going to quickly dilute the meaning of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=312.5s	312.5	 clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=313.5s	313.5	 It's not a tool to signal your dog to do something in advance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=316.1s	316.1	 It happens when a behavior occurs, not before behavior occurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=319.8s	319.8	 Now one trick that I've been wanting to teach her is crawl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=324.2s	324.2	 So we're going to see how that goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=325.2s	325.2	 This is another trick where we'll use luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=327.5s	327.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=328.5s	328.5	 She's already doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=330.3s	330.3	 You guys look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=331.3s	331.3	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=332.3s	332.3	 Look at those legs in the back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=333.3s	333.3	 They're in the crawl position almost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=336.1s	336.1	 So we're just going to lure her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=337.9s	337.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=339.3s	339.3	 Notice how I'm clicking like at any hint of the final motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 I'm not asking her for a refined perfect crawl for five seconds before I click and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=348.5s	348.5	 reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=349.5s	349.5	 If she shows me she's going a milist step in the right direction, I'm going to go ahead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=353.3s	353.3	 and click her and follow that up with a reward every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=356.8s	356.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=357.8s	357.8	 And I'm, you may not see it, but I am releasing the treat after I click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=364.9s	364.9	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=365.9s	365.9	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=366.9s	366.9	 How do you learn so fast?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=369.1s	369.1	 Lie down.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=371.2s	371.2	 I'm going to put a reward on the lie down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=374.2s	374.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=375.2s	375.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=376.2s	376.2	 And right there, since she's, and right there, what did I do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=381.9s	381.9	 When she got up, I pulled the treat away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=384.1s	384.1	 That made the treat get real far away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 Once she got out of the crawl position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=388.2s	388.2	 Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=389.2s	389.2	 She went back down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=390.5s	390.5	 I like that she's trying to keep the session going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=394.5s	394.5	 So basically, I mean, you can't use the clicker too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=396.8s	396.8	 If you're thinking, Hey, I like what you're doing there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=399.2s	399.2	 Click and give her reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=400.7s	400.7	 If you're good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=408.3s	408.3	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=409.3s	409.3	 Of course, you may have to contort in all kinds of ways to teach your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=417.9s	417.9	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=426.7s	426.7	 Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=431.1s	431.1	 Hug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=432.1s	432.1	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=437.2s	437.2	 Even though she's already done the hug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=438.9s	438.9	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=440.4s	440.4	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=442.4s	442.4	 Hug is looking pretty good too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=443.4s	443.4	 Here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=448.9s	448.9	 And again, just to remind you, we don't train tricks to be entertaining though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=452.5s	452.5	 It's okay if you do, but we really train tricks like this to keep our dogs engaged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=456.9s	456.9	 It's kind of like teaching advanced math to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=458.8s	458.8	 It really stimulates their brain, helps them understand broader communication with human

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=471.5s	471.5	 Notice how the lure isn't right at her nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=473.7s	473.7	 Keep going.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=480.4s	480.4	 she's getting the hang of it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=486.0s	486.0	 It's a really great way to make training a little more interesting for some dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=489.9s	489.9	 Maybe it makes it more interesting for you as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=495.5s	495.5	 It's just a way to plant the seed.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=517.1s	517.1	 She's doing well on neighborhood walks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=523.1s	523.1	 Today we're at historic Bayou St. John and we're going to do some leash training with

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=527.8s	527.8	 And while there are many historic facts about this bayou, the fact that real life pirates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=532.8s	532.8	 used to go up and down it is pretty crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=535.5s	535.5	 And plus some people think it's haunted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=537.1s	537.1	 I don't know.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=544.6s	544.6	 and getting even more reliable in this type of setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=547.7s	547.7	 And it may be time to start planting the seed for a proper heel later on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=553.1s	553.1	 This is really good here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=554.5s	554.5	 I mean, the barking is fine here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=555.7s	555.7	 I'm not too concerned about it actually, because we have a loose leash while she's barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=560.1s	560.1	 She's more nervous than she is like lunging at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=563.8s	563.8	 So I want to make sure that I give her plenty of room to go back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=567.4s	567.4	 Watch this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=571.0s	571.0	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=578.9s	578.9	 It's normal for young puppies to react and bark at other dogs like that because they're

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=583.7s	583.7	 You know, they don't know the context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=585.1s	585.1	 What are those dogs coming over here for?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=587.2s	587.2	 Who knows what they're thinking?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=588.7s	588.7	 Some people might react by correcting their dog or putting tension on the leash, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=592.6s	592.6	 really tends to aggravate the situation with a lot of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=595.8s	595.8	 And the fact that I was able to get her attention on me was evidence that she wasn't too overly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=599.8s	599.8	 stimulated.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=601.8s	601.8	 That's interesting, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=603.8s	603.8	 See those puppies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=604.8s	604.8	 I know.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=610.8s	610.8	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=613.2s	613.2	 That was a really good balance of letting her satisfy her curiosity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=618.2s	618.2	 I'm going to continue to let her do it by looking at him, vocalizing a little.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=622.5s	622.5	 I mean, you know, I got to watch that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=624.4s	624.4	 Maybe that turns into excessive barking later, but that's not the priority right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=628.1s	628.1	 The priority is it was acceptable and she was evaluating the dogs and I was still able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=633.9s	633.9	 to get her attention on me at some point there by asking for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=637.5s	637.5	 We've been out here just a few minutes and she's adjusting beautifully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=641.5s	641.5	 Let's continue on our way here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=644.1s	644.1	 Let her continue adjusting, but she's doing pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=647.1s	647.1	 Kona is typically the kind of dog that adjusts within like 10 or 15 minutes, which is really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=653.2s	653.2	 nice.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=658.8s	658.8	 Every dog is different.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=664.2s	664.2	 attention on me, that means she's probably ready to train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=667.3s	667.3	 Right now she's interested in this vegetation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=670.0s	670.0	 Kona, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=673.8s	673.8	 Little tough right now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=679.0s	679.0	 I'm still going to go ahead and give her a treat right now just to see you want more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=682.7s	682.7	 of that or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=684.1s	684.1	 If she goes back to doing what she's doing, she's probably not yet adjusted and I should

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=689.7s	689.7	 Let me just test just to see Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=693.0s	693.0	 Okay, looks like I'm able to get her attention there intermittently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=698.2s	698.2	 So she's starting to come through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=700.2s	700.2	 Let's see one more time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=703.4s	703.4	 Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=704.4s	704.4	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=707.0s	707.0	 That's pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=708.0s	708.0	 We can get her attention right now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=712.9s	712.9	 I mean, it's a fine line here in trying to seize those opportunities when your dog is

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=724.4s	724.4	 they're all about.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=726.4s	726.4	 They're really neat.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=731.0s	731.0	 She's aware of it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=743.2s	743.2	 Hey, this looks as good as any.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=988.1s	988.1	 taking a treat in this position right here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=991.9s	991.9	 So let me just play here for a minute, see if I can get her to understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=997.0s	997.0	 You can start to see just the glimmers of a heel there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=999.3s	999.3	 See that right there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1003.5s	1003.5	 I just want to let her know it's possible to exist in this part of the world right here,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1013.7s	1013.7	 Here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1016.9s	1016.9	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1018.9s	1018.9	 I almost had her there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1019.9s	1019.9	 I did push her a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1021.6s	1021.6	 So I'm content that she did at least that well on her very first heel session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1026.3s	1026.3	 Not bad at all, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1027.5s	1027.5	 Let's continue to walk with her here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1029.8s	1029.8	 So you can see how we're doing this kind of hybrid training session here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1033.0s	1033.0	 When she gives me her attention and she seems really into it, we're going to take that opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1037.2s	1037.2	 to do some training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1038.6s	1038.6	 And when she wants to just sniff around and explore, we're going to let her do that too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1041.9s	1041.9	 And the reason we're doing that is because she's at that very important socialization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1045.3s	1045.3	 period in her life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1046.5s	1046.5	 So socialization is everything, not just playing with dogs and people, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1050.2s	1050.2	 It's getting to know the entire world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1051.8s	1051.8	 There's a dog who's just trying to say hi to her as we walk down the street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1055.7s	1055.7	 Okay, come.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1062.7s	1062.7	 I'm just going to let the environment be the reward there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1067.5s	1067.5	 She's a little frazzled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1069.3s	1069.3	 Again, keep trying to do my best to keep the leash loose here just so she can feel like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1074.5s	1074.5	 she has freedom of movement, can really process what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1078.6s	1078.6	 I mean, that's a little weird to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1080.1s	1080.1	 She's like, wow, there's a dog over there coming from somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1083.9s	1083.9	 I can smell the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1085.1s	1085.1	 I can hear the dog, but I can't see the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1087.3s	1087.3	 You can see how she's like borderline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1088.8s	1088.8	 Can I really get her attention right now when she's frazzled like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1092.0s	1092.0	 Kona, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1093.0s	1093.0	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1102.0s	1102.0	 looked up at me, I was able to encourage her with my body language to come towards me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1106.8s	1106.8	 So you've got to kind of think about all those nuanced ways that we communicate with our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1110.9s	1110.9	 dogs and try to tap on those to the best of your ability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1114.4s	1114.4	 So here I'm really trying to push to get a little bit more out of that heel training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1119.2s	1119.2	 This is what we have to watch for as trainers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1121.1s	1121.1	 Sometimes that's a good idea, sometimes not so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1122.9s	1122.9	 So here in the case, we have a barking dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1125.1s	1125.1	 It's really throwing her off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1126.8s	1126.8	 It's far more beneficial to let her process the barking dog and this new place than it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1130.4s	1130.4	 is to insist on trying to get those last few steps of progress out of her heel training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1135.1s	1135.1	 session.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1137.1s	1137.1	 Always be flexible and prepared to change your game plan on a moment's notice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1140.1s	1140.1	 For Kona, she's actually starting to pull a little bit here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1143.5s	1143.5	 That's a little bit new for her.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_KqkZzwj4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=228&pp=iAQB&t=1193.0s	1193.0	 smell things and I've been trying to let her do that.
