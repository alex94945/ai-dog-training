https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 Like real chicken, but you could also use a toy if your dog is absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 Obsessed with that toy the key is your dog has to love the thing that you're teaching them with not just like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 So let's get down to business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=94.5s	94.5	 The first thing you want to do is give your dog a treat just to let them know look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=98.4s	98.4	 I got something really good and just keep it right there just out of their reach at this point though refrain from saying speak speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 Your goal right now is just to wait them out and kind of hang out with their currency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 But not give it to them until they bark is it to say hey, what's going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=111.6s	111.6	 What do I have to do to get that it's normal for there to be you know many minutes of waiting in the beginning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=118.7s	118.7	 I'm just gonna ignore these other things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=120.5s	120.5	 This is a very intermediate habit where a dog will start doing everything they know in order to get the reward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=126.2s	126.2	 He's going through his drills things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 He knows he's lying down saying is this what you want is this what I have to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 Do you want me to leave it is that what you want?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=133.3s	133.3	 I'll do that his play dead as you can see his rollover because in the past those have resulted in him getting the things he wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 This confusion is only temporary because as he reasons it through and does a variety of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=145.9s	145.9	 We're just going to be there to let him know which is the right thing we like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=149.4s	149.4	 It's kind of like a game of hot and cold you can see his eyes right now. He's really really thinking it through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=154.3s	154.3	 Do you see that look he had his I'm thinking about barking face on right there, so that's why rewarded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 Yes good that was very good. It wasn't huge, but I want to let him know he's on the right track
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 Yes, now that we've got it going. I want to keep it going. I don't want to take breaks here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 I wanted to keep the yes keep the progress going because he's starting to get it now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 Yes good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=178.9s	178.9	 I'll take that but I still want to turn that kind of rumbling growl into a nice proper bark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 Right there I could have rewarded, but I'm trying to up the ante a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=189.7s	189.7	 Oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=190.9s	190.9	 Yes good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 I'm refraining from saying speak here until I get the behavior a little bit more reliably and where I want it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=199.1s	199.1	 Yes good that one was a tad bit louder, so I'm liking this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 He's doing spin. That's another trick. He's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=207.2s	207.2	 Mastering yes good very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=209.3s	209.3	 I'm gonna give him a nice big dose of the thing he wants here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 Which is real chicken the idea is he learns when he gives that nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=216.6s	216.6	 Bark that I'm looking for that I give him those extra rewards to really make it ultra clear in his mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=222.3s	222.3	 That's the behavior. I'm looking for I expect this to start coming a little bit quicker now. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 Yes, good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=230.9s	230.9	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 Yes, very good. Oh man. That was good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 What I love about teaching things like speak for example is that you have to motivate your dog to want to do the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=241.9s	241.9	 You can't force a dog to do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=243.5s	243.5	 You can't teach this with traditional training methods like a choke chain or a prong collar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 The best way to introduce a new word like speak in this case to your dog is to say the word just as or just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=255.3s	255.3	 Before they do it let me show you what I mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 Very good you can invent your own hand signals whatever feels natural to you so for speak for Jacob
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=263.7s	263.7	 I'm kind of doing this speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=266.9s	266.9	 Speak good now. Let's see if Jacob will speak when I ask him to upon request
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=273.1s	273.1	 It's pretty early for this, but it would be pretty nice if he did speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=276.7s	276.7	 Yes, and right now. I'm not really picky on the volume or anything. I just want to see that. He's making an effort speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=284.8s	284.8	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=287.3s	287.3	 Yes, good job speak. This is how you show your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 What a word or phrase means Jacob's really getting the hang of this maybe a little too much so so at this point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=297.7s	297.7	 I'm pretty confident that Jacob knows what speak means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=300.3s	300.3	 Speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=301.5s	301.5	 Chances are once you teach your dog to speak like this they're gonna start barking all the time once they realize hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=306.4s	306.4	 Barking gets me rewards, so that's probably something you don't want which is why it's important for your dog to understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=312.7s	312.7	 What quiet means so it's very important that I don't reward him for speak unless I specifically ask for it again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 Since he knows what it means if he didn't know I would be a little bit more tolerant didn't ask that time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=325.5s	325.5	 I'm not going to reward again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=326.8s	326.8	 It might seem a little mean that I'm hoping to treat out here just like we were doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=330.3s	330.3	 But I want to make sure that I'm clear about my communication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=334.9s	334.9	 When I say no, I'm making that treat go far away to let him know no, that's the thing that's making it go away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=340.1s	340.1	 No
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=341.9s	341.9	 Quiet yes, there was a moment of quiet there, so I'm gonna come in and reward for that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=346.3s	346.3	 I'm gonna try and build on that quiet time now speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=349.9s	349.9	 good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=351.1s	351.1	 quiet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=352.5s	352.5	 Yes, I didn't even give him much of a chance to bark there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=356.4s	356.4	 But that's okay because I captured the behavior while he was being quiet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=359.9s	359.9	 So my goal here is to get a good speak and a good quiet back-to-back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=364.9s	364.9	 Good nice work Jacob quiet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=368.7s	368.7	 Yes, good work buddy, but what you're really doing here is you're polishing your communication with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=374.5s	374.5	 And that's what it's all about if you want to be able to achieve a very high level of mutual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=379.8s	379.8	 Communication with your dog and you've got to teach things like this to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=383.1s	383.1	 Not every dog though is cut out for speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=385.5s	385.5	 Some dogs are just a little more reserved or quiet or just kind of mellow, but that's okay though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=390.1s	390.1	 Every dog is different. I've got lots of videos on my youtube channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=393.3s	393.3	 So there's lots of different things you can teach your dog now if you are struggling with unwanted barking say when people come over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=399.6s	399.6	 Or when someone knocks at the door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=400.7s	400.7	 I'm gonna have a great video in the description that will show you how to deal with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 General annoying barking if you found this video helpful consider giving us a monthly tip on patreon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fcVPfkbYIM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=528&pp=iAQB&t=410.0s	410.0	 We use those funds to educate the public about humane positive fun dog training
