https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLVrzW_sFV4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=250&pp=iAQB&t=224.6s	224.6	 training has just begun.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLVrzW_sFV4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=250&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 know things like sit down and come.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLVrzW_sFV4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=250&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 but they fail to come to you reliably in more distracting circumstances,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLVrzW_sFV4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=250&pp=iAQB&t=279.8s	279.8	 to this world and be able to generally act in a way that we would consider

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLVrzW_sFV4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=250&pp=iAQB&t=416.3s	416.3	 Our dogs will look for loopholes throughout their lives
