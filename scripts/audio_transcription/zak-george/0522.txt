https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 There are many reasons you might want to keep your dog out of a certain room in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=35.3s	35.3	 Maybe you recently had a baby, or you've got fancy furniture in a certain room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 Or in Luca's case, your dog sneaks off when no one's paying attention to steal food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 Fortunately, there's always a way to make sure that Luca has her food when she needs it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=47.4s	47.4	 Pet Flow is a revolutionary service that will automatically deliver your dog's food to your front door twice a month or however often you'd like it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 All you have to do is choose your dog's favorite food and how often you want it shipped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 And bam, it's always there when you need it. You don't even have to remember to order it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 Since you have to get your dog's food anyway, get it this way. It'll make your life easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 And you're supporting the dog training revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=70.2s	70.2	 I'm going to have a special link and a coupon code in the description of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=73.6s	73.6	 That'll give you 20% off of your first auto ship order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=76.6s	76.6	 Luca, that's 20% off. That's such a good deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 Now let's go do some boundary training with Luca the Lab.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=83.5s	83.5	 Our goal today will be to teach Luca how to stay out of the kitchen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=87.3s	87.3	 A prerequisite for this is that you've taught your dog how to stay and you've taught them how to leave something alone when you ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=93.1s	93.1	 I'll be testing for that in a moment with Luca.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=95.3s	95.3	 But for the rest of you, if you haven't taught your dog this, I'll have links in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 Teaching your dog boundaries is actually pretty easy, but it does take a lot of consistency and a fair amount of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 But it's a great opportunity to build more sophisticated communication with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=110.3s	110.3	 For now though, make sure that your dog definitely doesn't have access to the areas of the house you're trying to keep them out of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=115.3s	115.3	 That means you've got to cut off all access to these areas by controlling their environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=119.9s	119.9	 Now I recommend that you actually attach the leash to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=122.9s	122.9	 And when you're not in a position to supervise, you can have them in another room where they're not in a position to get to those areas until you've done sufficient boundary training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=130.5s	130.5	 Like all things in dog training, boundary training can't really be taught passively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 So make sure you give them your full attention applying the techniques that I'm going to go over today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=137.8s	137.8	 When I was over here the other day, I left some food out on the counter and I walked out for just maybe three seconds and she was all over it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 First, let me confirm that Luca can do a basic stay while I walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=149.1s	149.1	 Luca, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 That's nice. You're doing terrific.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=153.7s	153.7	 Okay, so I'm satisfied she can do a basic stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=156.1s	156.1	 But what about when things get a little bit more exciting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=158.7s	158.7	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=162.3s	162.3	 Whoa, look at you. You're doing a great job. Look at all that chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=165.5s	165.5	 Okay, so this is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 What this tells me is that Luca has it in her to override her impulses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 So your dog has to have that basic impulse control before you can really teach them boundaries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 But she's doing fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 If she were to break, I'd simply escort her back to the point where I asked her to stay and try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 Maybe perhaps making it a little bit easier for her on the second attempt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 So I'm really happy with how well Luca is doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=190.5s	190.5	 She's staying. She's staying while I drop the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=192.7s	192.7	 But will she stay when I throw treats into the kitchen and I'm over there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 See, dogs are really smart and they can tell that if you're really far away from the treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=201.3s	201.3	 that they've got a chance of beating you to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 So I want to make sure she's really tight on that before I go on with my next step here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=207.6s	207.6	 Hey, Luca, look at me. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=209.8s	209.8	 Okay, ready? Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=211.7s	211.7	 I'm gonna go over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=213.7s	213.7	 And again, this is just to make sure that she'll stay when I give her my full attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=217.9s	217.9	 and throw a treat into the kitchen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=220.4s	220.4	 What a doll you are. You're doing so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 So our goal over the next few weeks is to make sure that Luca doesn't have access to this kitchen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=228.5s	228.5	 at all unless we give her permission to go in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=231.8s	231.8	 Let's simulate some real world kitchen activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=234.4s	234.4	 I want to make sure that she knows that there's some awesome food on the counter right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=238.4s	238.4	 So I'm gonna let her sniff this. Leave it alone. Good girl. That is really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=241.7s	241.7	 She's really on a good behavior right now. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=244.9s	244.9	 So I'm gonna go over here. It's much more difficult when your dog is farther away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=249.8s	249.8	 In other words, they understand, hey, there's an opportunity there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 And I want to make sure that I'm there to show her the right way to behave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 if she thinks about jumping up on that counter and stealing that food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=259.3s	259.3	 or even coming in the kitchen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 I'm gonna throw some chicken in front of her now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=264.8s	264.8	 Oh, good job. Good job. Nice correction there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 So, you know, I had to interrupt her. I thought she was gonna stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=271.1s	271.1	 So I was a little overconfident there, but she did a great job in correcting herself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=274.9s	274.9	 I'm gonna throw some chicken again. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 That's really good. She's looking right at me. I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=279.8s	279.8	 But I'm gonna see if I can push it a little bit more and get a little bit more success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=283.1s	283.1	 to keep her guessing a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=284.6s	284.6	 I'm gonna turn my back on her and I hope she's not going for anything and she's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=288.2s	288.2	 So that's good. What happens if I get this plate out over here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 Maybe grab one of these cupcakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=294.5s	294.5	 If your dog gets used to seeing you do normal things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=297.4s	297.4	 and you're in a position to also enforce the rules,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=300.2s	300.2	 then they're going to learn a lot quicker. Let's open the fridge again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=302.8s	302.8	 Let's open the fridge again. Some chocolate soy milk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=306.8s	306.8	 Gonna put that out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=308.6s	308.6	 Now I'll put it back in because I don't want any chocolate soy milk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 She is just knocking it out of the park right now. She's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=316.4s	316.4	 You should make every trip to the kitchen a training session for your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=320.3s	320.3	 if you're really serious about teaching this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=322.0s	322.0	 Since you'll want to sporadically reward when you're cooking dinner, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=325.6s	325.6	 it's a good idea to have some dog treats that keep well at room temperature available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=329.8s	329.8	 See, Luca is eager to grab any food that's been left out the moment the humans are out of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=334.4s	334.4	 room. So I'm going to try and do my best to make sure that doesn't happen right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=338.9s	338.9	 But this one's a little bit tricky. Make sure that everything we've covered so far is really solid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl7GjPVs9A4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=523&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 before moving on to your next step, which is out of sight boundary training.
