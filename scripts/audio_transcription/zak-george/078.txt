https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today we're going to uncover the shocking truth behind one of the biggest misconceptions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 in all of dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=6.9s	6.9	 And we're going to talk about how this one thing in many ways has held back dog training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=11.6s	11.6	 for generations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 I wonder what we have here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=14.1s	14.1	 Pup Box stands out because they customize the box for your dog's age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 Have you guys seen these?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 I already have one out that the dogs have been using.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 They found a way to simulate like chewing on a bone with this nylon wood material.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 It's tough, but it's not so tough that there isn't some give.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=29.3s	29.3	 So you don't get those sharp splinters and the things that make chewing on bones risky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=33.2s	33.2	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 Chicken and blueberries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=35.2s	35.2	 How do they make chicken and blueberries look so appetizing together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=38.4s	38.4	 Don't they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 Pup Boxes aren't just for puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 They follow your dog through all four life stages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=43.6s	43.6	 We have a young pup and a grown pup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 My favorite thing about a good plush toy is that it has multiple textures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 And I bet there's a squeaker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=50.5s	50.5	 There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 Do I know dog toys or what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=52.7s	52.7	 And I'm pretty sure that's a hundred percent accurate whale sound too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 This is from loving pets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 I think this is a medium lasting chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=59.6s	59.6	 Chews like this are a great thing for separation anxiety sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=62.7s	62.7	 You get lots of high value rewards here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 And my favorite part is that Pup Box provides you with evidence based dog training advice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=68.7s	68.7	 You get this nice card with lots of great advice, double sided too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=71.9s	71.9	 If you want to try this, you can get 50% off your first box.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 I'll have the link in the description of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=78.4s	78.4	 In a recent video, we had a discussion as to whether or not aversion or physical corrections
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=83.3s	83.3	 perceived as unpleasant by dogs are necessary as part of our regular dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=87.9s	87.9	 There is a scientific consensus on this matter, even though we dog trainers who are mostly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=92.1s	92.1	 not scientists are divided on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=94.4s	94.4	 We've established in our last several videos, including that one, how much misinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=99.3s	99.3	 there actually is in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=101.7s	101.7	 I'm going to have that link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 Highly recommend that you check that out as a prerequisite to this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=106.9s	106.9	 The spoiler is that it's not even close to controversial that using aversion in dog training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 is unnecessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=113.7s	113.7	 I know that this is something that a lot of you have strong opinions about because it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=117.5s	117.5	 was the number one comment on our recent dog training crisis video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 It's not an understatement to say there's a full on crisis in dog training right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=125.4s	125.4	 And if I'm being straight with you, we are tired of just standing by watching the public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=129.7s	129.7	 be misinformed in mass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 One comment that I couldn't help but see dozens of times was basically something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=136.3s	136.3	 What about mother dogs teaching their puppies by physically correcting them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 Or what about dog to dog communication, which involves one dog being physically unpleasant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 to another dog with the aim of guiding their future behavior?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=148.9s	148.9	 And the question would basically be, isn't that natural?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 And shouldn't we emulate that dog to dog behavior and adapt it for our use?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=156.3s	156.3	 So today I want to talk about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 Do the harsher ways that dogs sometimes communicate with each other in nature provide a valid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=164.7s	164.7	 rationale for the use of aversive punishments in dog training by humans?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 I asked my audience this very question just yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 We have 3,400 votes at the time of recording this video and 17% selected true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=180.9s	180.9	 That's pretty, that's statistically significant by a pretty significant margin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=184.6s	184.6	 That's why we really need to talk about this because remember if we're building something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 we want to make sure that we're building our dog training ideas on top of true hypotheses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 And after all, I mean, if dogs do behave this way and are physically corrected or punished
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 by one another and that alters their behavior, maybe we have something to learn from this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 I mean, the truth is dogs do have a natural form of communication and behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=206.8s	206.8	 And we study that and we attempt to understand that through the science of animal behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=210.9s	210.9	 Dogs use body language and vocalizations to communicate with each other all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=214.7s	214.7	 Generally physical aggressive interactions aren't a regular part of this communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=219.3s	219.3	 Keep in mind that most physical or tactile communication between dogs does not rise to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 the level of aggressive behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=226.1s	226.1	 I mean, dogs will sometimes use aggressive behavior in some situations when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=229.8s	229.8	 feeling defensive or when they're guarding something they value or if they're feeling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=233.3s	233.3	 particularly fearful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=234.3s	234.3	 But this is not a normal part of their communication with each other on a daily basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=238.7s	238.7	 Dogs are social animals and they generally communicate with each other in a more non-confrontational
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=243.3s	243.3	 cooperative way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=244.5s	244.5	 When it comes to conflict between dogs, it's not just about the physical altercation that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=248.9s	248.9	 occurs between dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=250.5s	250.5	 Communication events happen before that and when those events fail, that's what leads
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 to altercation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=256.1s	256.1	 As a general rule, when conflict does arise among dogs, they communicate with lots of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=261.2s	261.2	 body language that gradually progresses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=264.3s	264.3	 They'll display more benign signals like licking their lips or yawning or trying to avoid whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=269.2s	269.2	 it is that's making them uncomfortable by simply walking away from it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 And the aim of this type of body language is to create distance to avoid confrontation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 They'll typically only escalate to more aggressive behaviors like growling, air snaps, or a bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 If those early attempts to communicate failed to resolve the issue they were having.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=288.6s	288.6	 Many people will point to the instance of a mother dog snapping at a young puppy as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 an example for how to correct their own dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=295.8s	295.8	 People will argue that using subtle, quick or least aversive corrections like a quick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=300.4s	300.4	 leash pop or a yell is similar to a mother dog's gentle snap or sharp bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=305.4s	305.4	 And in some cases, this is how they justify using these aversive or punishing techniques.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=310.2s	310.2	 Look, while it is true that mothers may resort to physical corrections like that, as far
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=314.5s	314.5	 as I know, it's a myth that this is a primary way that they communicate with their puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=318.6s	318.6	 If a mother dog goes beyond those quick, subtle corrections, for example, if she's causing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 harm or actually biting her puppies, this is considered a major red flag amongst breeders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=327.6s	327.6	 and those who raise puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 Typically it means there's an external issue like something medical or possibly something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=332.6s	332.6	 in the mother dog's environment that's causing her to feel uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=335.5s	335.5	 Maybe she doesn't have a place to peacefully escape and get some time away from her puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 Or maybe she's got a giant litter and she feels overworked and needs some additional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=342.8s	342.8	 support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvEuOtC3MQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=343.8s	343.8	 But in a typical situation, a healthy and emotionally stable mother dog doesn't need
