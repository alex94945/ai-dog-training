https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=16.3s	16.3	 Cheeto the puppy is going to learn how to come when we call him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 You know, come when called is one of the most important skills that our dogs need to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=23.9s	23.9	 We should practice this early and often and in lots of different places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=27.9s	27.9	 By the way, did you guys see my last video on how to teach your dog to listen to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=30.8s	30.8	 around other dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=31.8s	31.8	 If not, check out the description like me on Facebook too at facebook.com slash the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 And I have a pretty serious question for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=40.4s	40.4	 Are corgis the cutest puppies ever?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 Think about that as you watch this video and tell me in the comments below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=48.8s	48.8	 We're here with Aaron and Walker and Cheeto the corgi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=51.3s	51.3	 How reliable would you say he's been on come when called to this point in various environments?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 About 60%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 Okay, so we got to get that up a little bit, don't we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=59.3s	59.3	 When we're teaching our dogs to come to us, the first thing we want to do is get it really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=62.3s	62.3	 tight, really solid in an environment like this in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=65.7s	65.7	 So I was thinking we would practice in here for a little bit, then maybe move on to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=69.2s	69.2	 little bit more of a distracting environment and then maybe even more distracting if he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=73.1s	73.1	 does well with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=74.1s	74.1	 I'm going to go over a game with you that you can do with your dog to teach them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 come to you when you have two people in the household.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 Always call your dog in a very enthusiastic and happy voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=83.2s	83.2	 We want to make sure that our dog is enjoying the training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=86.5s	86.5	 Never call your dog in that firm voice because, well, they're not going to look forward to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 training as much if you do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=91.3s	91.3	 Walker, what kind of currency are you going to use with Cheeto today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 So today we have his liver training treatment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=95.7s	95.7	 We've got Walker over here, we've got Aaron over here, and we're going to call him back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=99.2s	99.2	 and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=100.2s	100.2	 Cheeto, come to mom!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=101.2s	101.2	 Look at him go!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 That's it, that's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 We want our dogs bolting to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=105.3s	105.3	 We want them running to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=106.6s	106.6	 With a dog like Cheeto, the more genuine, the more enthusiastic, the more energetic you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=110.5s	110.5	 are, the more likely they are to come running to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 Now if your dog doesn't respond so much to this high energy approach, maybe try using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 a soft, gentle, more understanding approach if they tend to be a bit more reserved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=121.5s	121.5	 Cheeto!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 Now, actually, let's pause here for a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=125.1s	125.1	 Right now you're calling him Cheeto's like, I don't know, I'd rather be over here with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 my dad, he's got these treats and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=130.3s	130.3	 Look for those small moments when your dog is thinking about listening to you and sees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=134.3s	134.3	 those moments in order to really encourage them to listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=137.3s	137.3	 If they look like they're thinking about coming to you, do everything you can to keep them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 in that mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 If you notice that your dog is coming to you halfway and then they're like, I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 so much, it's important to shorten the distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Make it a little bit easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=151.1s	151.1	 Remember, the best dog trainers will not hesitate to take a step back on their training in order

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 Why don't you guys go ahead and practice at a closer range and see if you can have some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=160.3s	160.3	 more success here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=161.5s	161.5	 Reward him heavily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=163.3s	163.3	 With a skill like come when called, we want to reward very generously with our dogs in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=167.7s	167.7	 order to really give them that good association with listening to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=170.7s	170.7	 The next step is to start calling them randomly when they're least expecting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=174.4s	174.4	 Now let's see if you can do it with your back turned a bit, you know, to throw them off,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=177.5s	177.5	 make things a little bit different because come when called really matters most when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=181.6s	181.6	 they are not expecting it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=189.2s	189.2	 What do you think about trying it by the fridge?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 Good?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=198.7s	198.7	 I somehow talked Walker into lying on his back to do this, but in all seriousness, teaching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=202.5s	202.5	 your dog to come to you when you're assuming different positions really challenges them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 drill if that makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=211.6s	211.6	 Go ahead and call Cheeto and see if he comes to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=216.6s	216.6	 And do you see how thrown off he is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 And do you have your currency with you to let him know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 Go ahead.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 Don't be discouraged.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=255.2s	255.2	 Okay, so Cheeto is familiar with this area, but he doesn't live here and that's a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=595&pp=iAQB&t=260.5s	260.5	 setting for a dog.
