https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 So he was always wearing jackets and coats. Costumes were just a natural next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 I make most of the costumes himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=86.3s	86.3	 What have been some of your proudest accomplishments over the last six years?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 The biggest one is definitely being a New York Times bestseller with his first book.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=105.2s	105.2	 It's actually harder to get him to eat a hot dog than it is to stop him from eating a hot dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 I imagine he doesn't want to eat his own kind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 We'll shoot this way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=118.5s	118.5	 I use a DSLR for my shots. I use iPhones too when I'm on the go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 I try to take it right on his level. That's a good tip for people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=125.7s	125.7	 He doesn't seem stressed out at all here. He seems totally eager.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 So there's all the colorful decoration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=136.9s	136.9	 Get it. Get it. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=138.8s	138.8	 He is so polite. What is wrong with you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 Why aren't you gobbling that up?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 I think it's time for a drink. What do you say, Crusoe?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=151.3s	151.3	 The Bulldog is one of our favorite bars here in New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=154.7s	154.7	 And I imagine Crusoe is probably the ultimate wingman. Am I right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 He's pretty good. He's known as a ladies man.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 Sometimes we get recognized more in the States than in Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 Isn't that funny? Wow, that's cool. I know he's world famous.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=175.4s	175.4	 he gets better at dealing with the noise and the distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=178.5s	178.5	 But we've taken him to New York City, busy streets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 and he's getting so much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=182.2s	182.2	 He's pretty well traveled and well cultured now too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=192.8s	192.8	 We'll do a non-alcoholic just in case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=194.8s	194.8	 Good idea.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=215.2s	215.2	 and that way he'll lick his chops, make it look like he had a drink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVpAGhNco4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 That's...
