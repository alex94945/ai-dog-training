https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=91.9s	91.9	 Ouch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 She's a bit of a puppy biter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 as most seven-week, eight-week-old dogs are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=96.9s	96.9	 Isn't she only seven weeks old?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=98.3s	98.3	 Dogs engage the world with their mouth like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=100.6s	100.6	 They like to bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=101.5s	101.5	 Also, add to that, they're really teething all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 Do you guys have a lot of different chew toys around?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=106.5s	106.5	 At least 10.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=107.4s	107.4	 Are the 10 chew toys like different textures?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=110.2s	110.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 It really is important to have lots of different textures for your chew toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=114.1s	114.1	 because sometimes dogs are in the mood for something soft,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 sometimes hard, sometimes something in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=118.5s	118.5	 With this biting here, the first thing that I want to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=121.1s	121.1	 is give her something acceptable to bite on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=122.9s	122.9	 because she's biting at my clothes, she's biting my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=125.3s	125.3	 We don't want this behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 The way to handle it when your dog is biting like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=128.7s	128.7	 is to redirect them onto something that is acceptable to bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 Redirection is our mantra right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=134.8s	134.8	 Do you see right there, even though I'm giving her a toy to chew on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 she's still getting my hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 They'll do that too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 That's also a very normal part of puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=141.7s	141.7	 There's nothing magical about a toy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 and sometimes they still may prefer to bite your hands,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 but that's why you have to be really consistent about moving it around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 Do you see how she's kind of bored with it right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=150.3s	150.3	 It's not really doing the trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 I'm going to try a different toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 and see if this one gets her more interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 This is why it's important to have a variety of different toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 because dogs can get bored with one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=158.3s	158.3	 This one has a crinkly sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Hear that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=160.9s	160.9	 Ooh, there's a squeaker in there too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=162.3s	162.3	 Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=164.7s	164.7	 A little keep away with her, entice her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=168.1s	168.1	 And so now she's into this toy here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=169.9s	169.9	 Another great way to address puppy biting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 is of course to show your dog what you prefer they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=175.4s	175.4	 So in this case, we prefer her to sit and behave politely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=179.1s	179.1	 We'll go ahead and give her a treat right there for being good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=181.3s	181.3	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=182.1s	182.1	 That's another way to redirect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=183.6s	183.6	 The added benefit to redirecting your dog with food as opposed to play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=187.7s	187.7	 is that it quells their biting just by virtue of them eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 When a dog is eating, they're much less likely to be bitey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=193.7s	193.7	 because they go into food mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=195.8s	195.8	 And when they're in food mode,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=196.9s	196.9	 they start licking more and they're less playful typically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=199.8s	199.8	 I noticed you didn't give it to her right away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=201.7s	201.7	 You really let her lick it and experience it before you let her have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=205.4s	205.4	 Yeah, you're exactly right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=206.4s	206.4	 I tend to really let them know, look, that's there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=208.3s	208.3	 but you're going to have to hold that position for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=210.5s	210.5	 Now, the idea isn't to eliminate puppy biting overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 The idea is to reduce it a little by little every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=216.3s	216.3	 What have you taught her already?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=217.7s	217.7	 In addition to the crate training and the potty training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 we've moved on to sit and we're also working on name recognition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 Oh, good. How is she doing with her name?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=225.1s	225.1	 She's doing pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 She definitely will not come, but she will acknowledge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=229.6s	229.6	 And I wait and make eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=231.6s	231.6	 The eye contact, that's huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 And the more you just do general training like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=234.9s	234.9	 like right now, I'm just going into a rollover training session with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=238.1s	238.1	 The more you do this with your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=239.5s	239.5	 you're building that overall communication with them as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=242.7s	242.7	 When you have that kind of communication,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=244.5s	244.5	 dogs are going to learn much quicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=246.3s	246.3	 Communication isn't just natural straight away for a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=249.1s	249.1	 So we have to introduce this whole concept of communicating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=251.9s	251.9	 The communication building phase is a good four months of real dedicated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 training to get you guys on the same page where you can understand one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=259.5s	259.5	 With Winnie being so young,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=261.2s	261.2	 it might be a natural question to ask yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=263.7s	263.7	 When can you start training a dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=265.5s	265.5	 Right about now looks like a good time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=267.2s	267.2	 Seven weeks, eight weeks. That's a really good age to train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=269.8s	269.8	 Let's see if we can get her to do a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 We'll lure. Yes. And how about a down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=274.2s	274.2	 We're going to lure her into a down. Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=276.5s	276.5	 That looks really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=277.7s	277.7	 The fact that she will follow a lure into a sit, into a down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=281.1s	281.1	 that sets up a perfect opportunity to teach her how to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 Now, typically I'll break stay down into three categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=286.7s	286.7	 There's stay for a period of time only.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=289.3s	289.3	 Then there's stay while we walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=291.1s	291.1	 The farther we are from our dogs, the tougher it is for them to focus on us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=294.6s	294.6	 And then finally, there's stay with distractions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=297.5s	297.5	 which we would introduce later on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=299.1s	299.1	 But I think right now, with her being so young,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=300.7s	300.7	 we can practice stay for a period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=303.1s	303.1	 Stay? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=304.9s	304.9	 And every time she does what I like, I'm just going to reward there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=307.8s	307.8	 You got to start with a half a second stay before you can get a five minute stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=310.8s	310.8	 Stay? One, two, three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=313.4s	313.4	 Yes. I love how she looked at me there, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=315.6s	315.6	 I'm going to say, OK, let her know the stay is over now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=317.8s	317.8	 She can get up. I'll even lure her into an up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 The reason she's doing so well on her stay right now is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 number one, you guys have done a really good job with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=324.5s	324.5	 But secondly, we're not asking for so much right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=327.6s	327.6	 We're trying to keep it very realistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=329.3s	329.3	 She's new to training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=330.5s	330.5	 And we don't want to just continually set her up to fail by asking for 30
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=333.9s	333.9	 and 60 second stays when she hasn't had a ton of experience yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=337.6s	337.6	 We're not just training her for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=339.3s	339.3	 We want to build her confidence for her to feel comfortable in her own skin as a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=344.5s	344.5	 So the purpose is twofold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=346.3s	346.3	 It's for us and for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWyeBRfVmzA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 Click thumbs up for Winnie, Carolyn and Derek.
