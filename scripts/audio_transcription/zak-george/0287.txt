https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=4.6s	4.6	 Let's go. Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 Haha!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=6.8s	6.8	 And stay!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=8.4s	8.4	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 I train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=10.8s	10.8	 This is my new dog, and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=14.8s	14.8	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=17.4s	17.4	 You can start from the beginning, or you can pick up anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 Subscribe and hit the bell notification so you never miss an episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 your results will forever remain in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 This is Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=31.2s	31.2	 Welcome to the Dog Training Experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 In today's episode, we're going to take a walk in a moderately busy city setting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 and see how Inertia does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 When you have a dog, you have to regularly care for them by training them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=42.8s	42.8	 and exercising them and feeding them well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=45.2s	45.2	 There are lots of great dog foods on the market to choose from,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 and you can be sure that PepFlo will have the one you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=50.4s	50.4	 The thing that makes PepFlo different is that they can easily make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 that your dog's food is there when you need it by ordering it just one time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 Choose the food that you want, and you just tell PepFlo how often you want it delivered,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 once or twice a month for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 Enter code ZACH30 at checkout and you'll get $10 off your first three automatic shipments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 I'll have the link and details in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 So you guys might remember we have a new place here in Atlanta,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 and I'm trying to get Inertia acclimated with all of the new variables
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=76.4s	76.4	 that we have to train around down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 I got this place on one hand because we have a park in the back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 which is great for dog training, but the downside is we have a busy road out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 So today's training environment is going to require me to train around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=87.8s	87.8	 loud, fast-moving cars and unexpected distractions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 which you invariably get every time you go in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 Let's make sure Inertia knows how to stay at the doorway when I open it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=97.8s	97.8	 Stay, this is something we've been working a lot on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=101.2s	101.2	 Very good, awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=102.8s	102.8	 And I want to point out too, that's for today's training lesson,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 I have an extra safety attachment right here, just a D-ring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=108.6s	108.6	 You can get these online just about anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=110.6s	110.6	 Just in the unlikely event,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 I find myself in a position where I let go of the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 I'm going to actually hold this for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=116.4s	116.4	 I really want to ingrain in her psyche that she is never to walk out of this door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=121.4s	121.4	 without permission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=122.4s	122.4	 We're trying to come up with random, exciting distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 in an effort to ensure that Inertia will stay under the most exciting circumstances
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 we can simulate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=129.8s	129.8	 Okay, Bri, would you mind distracting her?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 So this is what it looks like from our perspective, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 And normally Inertia goes running there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 Okay, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 I would classify this as a really advanced training environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 Immediately, she's distracted by the ground sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 The ground is more distracting when it's wet than it is when it's dry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 Let me see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 Okay, Inertia, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=160.4s	160.4	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 Back up, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 So I'm going to get a little peppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=163.8s	163.8	 I'm going to let her know, look, I got something better than the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 that you're going to enjoy more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 All you have to do is pay attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 This is literally the first time I've done this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 This is the first time I've done this exercise out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=173.2s	173.2	 And my goal is just to make sure that I can get her attention at will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 as cars drive by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 Our ultimate destination today is an outdoor shopping mall that's pretty close by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=181.8s	181.8	 I'd love to make it that far, but if Inertia is sending me signals saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 you know, I'm not feeling this training session,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=187.2s	187.2	 I'm fully prepared to abandon it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 So this is kind of different than my typical least training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=192.4s	192.4	 in that we actually do have a destination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=195.4s	195.4	 Okay, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=196.4s	196.4	 I'm not going to insist on a heel straight away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=199.2s	199.2	 I just want to make sure that she stays kind of close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=201.6s	201.6	 You might notice too, I've shortened the leash considerably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 I'm holding it over here because we're on a sidewalk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 We don't have unlimited space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=208.2s	208.2	 Let me make sure I can get her eyes on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 Inertia, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 This is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=212.2s	212.2	 Very urban environment here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 I'm able to get her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=214.8s	214.8	 Okay, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 Easy, wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 So you got a little ahead of me there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 Let me see if I can get her to voluntarily come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=225.8s	225.8	 Inertia, come here, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 Thank you. Can you come here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 Because I work with Inertia so much,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 I can tell she's a little distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 So I'm falling back on a food lure here to help keep her attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=236.4s	236.4	 Over the next several weeks, I'll begin phasing out the lures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 as she becomes more adapted to places like this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 Back here. Good. This way. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 Sometimes getting into a rhythm, getting a little peppier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 livens things up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=250.2s	250.2	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 That's it. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 Come on. This way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=254.2s	254.2	 That's cool. Almost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=257.2s	257.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=257.8s	257.8	 Up here. Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=259.6s	259.6	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=261.8s	261.8	 Periodically, I'll ask her to wait when she starts to pull ahead like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 Inertia, wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=266.8s	266.8	 She's really good about listening to wait most of the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=269.2s	269.2	 so I have a loose leash here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=270.4s	270.4	 Let her explore a little bit, but I also don't want her just pulling ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 I'm trying to kind of keep it casual, mixed with a little bit more formal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=277.4s	277.4	 so I don't overwhelm her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=278.8s	278.8	 because I'm also trying to desensitize her to all of this traffic at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=282.6s	282.6	 I am throwing a lot at her, so I want to be really conscious of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=285.6s	285.6	 Now, I'm not saying that every walk should look like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=288.4s	288.4	 This is a training walk where I'm really focused on instilling rules,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=292.2s	292.2	 but sometimes you just have to let your dog walk, smell, and just be a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 Big truck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=299.8s	299.8	 It hits the trees as it goes by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=302.2s	302.2	 This is our first little intersection right here that we've had to practice at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=305.2s	305.2	 I want to make sure that inertia really improves on split-second decisions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 when it comes to listening to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 I know I have a significant crosswalk coming up at a very, very busy intersection,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 so I think I want to practice here a little bit to make sure I can get her paying attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=319.4s	319.4	 Stay. So right there. I mean, there you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=321.8s	321.8	 She started to walk ahead. I had her on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 I had to brace to make sure that she didn't advance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=326.4s	326.4	 That's why we train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=327.6s	327.6	 Here's another one. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 Okay, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=330.8s	330.8	 Inertia, look at me. I'm going to turn around as though I have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=334.4s	334.4	 Inertia, look over here. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 Yes. Good. Come on. This way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=339.4s	339.4	 That's right. Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=341.2s	341.2	 Stay. Back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 Good. Back up. Back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=344.6s	344.6	 Good. Okay. Come on. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=347.2s	347.2	 You're doing great. You're doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=348.8s	348.8	 I'm doing a lot of turns halfway because I want that option in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=353.4s	353.4	 In case a car is coming and I have to hurry up and get out of the way, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=356.4s	356.4	 And as challenging as this driveway was, our next intersection is much busier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=360.8s	360.8	 Easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 Look at this. I have tension immediately going into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=364.4s	364.4	 She's like pulling towards me, so I got to get that under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=367.4s	367.4	 Stay. I mean, ideally in the future, you approach an intersection like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=371.4s	371.4	 you have a nice loose leash at all times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=373.8s	373.8	 Oh, we got to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 Hey, Inertia. Oh, gosh. This is...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=378.2s	378.2	 Hi, how are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=379.4s	379.4	 This is a train wreck right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=384.2s	384.2	 Look at me. Okay, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=385.8s	385.8	 I got her attention for a split second there at the end,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=388.4s	388.4	 but she was like smelling and dragging and pulling me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=391.0s	391.0	 I think I need to practice that a little bit more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 It makes perfect sense, too, if you think about it, because it's a crazy environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=397.4s	397.4	 You're walking. There's giant vehicles moving past you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=401.0s	401.0	 They're so loud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=401.8s	401.8	 Why would she want to look at me when there's all of that going around?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=404.6s	404.6	 So here's a bus. They tend to be kind of loud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=406.8s	406.8	 So let's see how she does when this bus starts accelerating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=410.8s	410.8	 What is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=412.4s	412.4	 That's a loud Marta bus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=414.4s	414.4	 But on another note, her sit-stay here at this intersection is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=417.8s	417.8	 Spending a few minutes here can be very valuable for your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=421.2s	421.2	 I mean, surrounded by cars on all sides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=424.2s	424.2	 Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=425.2s	425.2	 Good. Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=427.2s	427.2	 Inertia. Come on. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=428.4s	428.4	 Let's go. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=430.4s	430.4	 And stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=433.0s	433.0	 I'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=434.0s	434.0	 I think for her first time for this kind of training session, she did really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=437.4s	437.4	 I'm not going to push her much further.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=438.8s	438.8	 Now, let's see if we can make it to the outdoor mall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=440.6s	440.6	 and see how she does in a crowded parking lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=442.8s	442.8	 I don't want her pulling me, but I'm going to be a little relaxed here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=446.0s	446.0	 on what I ask of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=447.2s	447.2	 Right off the bat here, people are making a left in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=449.6s	449.6	 I've got my dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=457.6s	457.6	 Stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=463.0s	463.0	 Yes. Let's jog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=465.2s	465.2	 There's a nice little jog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=466.4s	466.4	 I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=467.4s	467.4	 I want to make sure that she can generally pay attention to me here in the parking lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=470.8s	470.8	 This is the least congested part of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=473.4s	473.4	 Easy. There's debris all over the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=475.6s	475.6	 This way. Come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=480.4s	480.4	 I'm not even asking for a heel and she's like, I'll do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=483.0s	483.0	 I can readily get her attention right here in this part of the parking lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=486.4s	486.4	 I'm ready to move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=487.4s	487.4	 There's a store in the mall here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=488.6s	488.6	 They're pretty dog friendly in this part of town.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=490.6s	490.6	 I'd like to see how she does in a store if she continues to be this cooperative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=494.4s	494.4	 But going downhill is going to be extra tough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=496.4s	496.4	 Yes. I'm going to really acknowledge that I like that she's showing restraint downhill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=500.4s	500.4	 because it's so easy for a dog to pull when you're walking downhill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=503.6s	503.6	 She's a little riled up right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=505.4s	505.4	 Not easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=506.2s	506.2	 See that really insistent pulling is where I'm going to stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=509.2s	509.2	 Easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=510.6s	510.6	 And here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=512.2s	512.2	 Okay, let's go in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=513.2s	513.2	 So we're here at Ansley Wine Merchants right now and they're super dog friendly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=516.8s	516.8	 So it's a great way to train in a new indoor environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=519.8s	519.8	 You can see she's like really interested in everything right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=524.0s	524.0	 Little anxious. Hear the whining.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=525.4s	525.4	 Right now I just want her to explore and hopefully not knock over bottles of wine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=529.8s	529.8	 Now that she's adjusted a bit, let me see if I can get her attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=533.2s	533.2	 Here. Stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=534.8s	534.8	 Look at me. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=536.8s	536.8	 Yes. Look at that. That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=539.8s	539.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=541.2s	541.2	 Back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=542.6s	542.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=543.0s	543.0	 And after like 30 seconds of being in here, I was able to get her to readily pay attention to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=547.4s	547.4	 in a place that she's not very familiar with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=549.0s	549.0	 Remember, a way to measure your dog's compliance is will they do a variety of the tricks or skills that they know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=554.2s	554.2	 when you ask them to in different environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=556.8s	556.8	 Hug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=557.6s	557.6	 Oh, look at that. First attempt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=559.8s	559.8	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=561.2s	561.2	 We're going to get us a bottle of champagne here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=563.6s	563.6	 You can't drink. You're not 21 yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=566.0s	566.0	 Let's go this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=568.0s	568.0	 Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=570.2s	570.2	 Come on. Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=572.6s	572.6	 Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=573.4s	573.4	 Remember, Inersha still gets excited when meeting new people and this can catch even me off guard sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=579.0s	579.0	 Boy. Okay. It's all, it's a complete disaster now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=585.2s	585.2	 Easy. Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=586.8s	586.8	 Oh, goodness gracious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=588.8s	588.8	 She was doing so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=590.0s	590.0	 Obviously we have work to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=591.6s	591.6	 Can you be more exciting again like you just did and I want to see if I can have her stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=595.2s	595.2	 I want Inersha to stay when she's asked to even when she's invited to jump by strangers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=600.4s	600.4	 And this person is willing to help me out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=602.4s	602.4	 So I'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=603.2s	603.2	 Very good. Much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=604.6s	604.6	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=606.0s	606.0	 So yeah, it took a little bit of work and that's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=608.0s	608.0	 Ultimately, you know, you want your dog listening to you, not not whatever's going on in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=612.8s	612.8	 When we first came up here, she was pretty yamped up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=614.8s	614.8	 But after she got satisfied here and adapted, she tended to settle down naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=619.0s	619.0	 I think we're headed in the right direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=620.4s	620.4	 That was Inersha's most serious city training session yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=624.0s	624.0	 I think she really did an awesome job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=626.0s	626.0	 Give her a thumbs up if you thought so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=627.6s	627.6	 In the next episode, we're going to continue to work with Inersha in busy distracting settings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=631.8s	631.8	 and take her to an even busier city setting here in New Orleans for her biggest test yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=636.4s	636.4	 Get $10 off your first three automatic shipments from PepFlo by entering discount code ZAK30.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OI7o9pnj_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=644.8s	644.8	 follow us on Instagram and TikTok where everything is updated in real time.
