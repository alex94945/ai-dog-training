https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I think the dogs should have personhood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=2.0s	2.0	 They are people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=2.9s	2.9	 Say what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=3.7s	3.7	 People are going to jump on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=5.1s	5.1	 I bet people stitch this on TikTok or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=7.7s	7.7	 Personhood is a legal term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 I don't mean I think dogs are humans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=10.3s	10.3	 Right, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=11.2s	11.2	 They feel, clearly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 They're sentient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=13.6s	13.6	 They can learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=14.6s	14.6	 They can use intelligent disobedience, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 is not listening to you because it's in their best interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 not to listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 Maybe if you call them in a car, it's coming,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 and they see that and they disobey, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 That would be intelligent disobedience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=25.6s	25.6	 That's a complex animal right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=27.2s	27.2	 that has been really highly tuned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=29.1s	29.1	 through selective breeding for thousands of years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=31.5s	31.5	 to communicate with people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 That's a pretty amazing thing right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=35.4s	35.4	 And we should be very careful and deliberate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 in how we interact with them and be very thoughtful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 and not passive about doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 It's a serious responsibility when you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 training another animal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=46.4s	46.4	 And it's only in everyone's best interest to do so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=48.6s	48.6	 So if we train them with care, we're going to be happier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=50.8s	50.8	 It's really the bottom line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=52.3s	52.3	 I mean, we can do it because it's nice, cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 I would like to think we would all do that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEFnlqRFUY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=27&pp=iAQB&t=56.2s	56.2	 but it will probably make your life a lot better.
