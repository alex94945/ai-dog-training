https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 We all want our puppies to be trained, but if they won't stay when we ask them to in an uncontrolled environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=6.2s	6.2	 well, what good is our training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=7.6s	7.6	 And so my job as a trainer is to get this mammal who's been on this planet for just a few weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 to listen to me while outside. I mean after all that is why you guys are subscribed to my channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=18.1s	18.1	 Okay, so you guys know when i'm working with a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=20.1s	20.1	 I like them to be in a good mood because i'm certainly not going to rely on physically correcting them over and over to teach them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 So a dog has to want to do something but that's not just about constantly giving them treats either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 I mean after all i'm not just a treat dispenser. I actually need biscuits to like me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 And that's saying something. But if I can get her having a good time with me, I know i'm off to a good start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=41.5s	41.5	 This really is my secret when I train dogs. When I use toys, they must be very sophisticated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 And the ingenuity of these dog toys never ceases to impress me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=50.8s	50.8	 But there's more to these toys than you think at first. Like for example, that is designed for a good tug of war with a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=56.6s	56.6	 Some dogs really prefer plushy toys like this. This is what you get in your bark box every month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 But other dogs prefer a more durable dog toy. Super chewers for those dogs who are real hard on toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=67.7s	67.7	 For example on this toy, look at all the layers and the thickness of that. That has to be ballistic nylon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=72.9s	72.9	 So lots of dogs prefer these harder more firm toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=75.9s	75.9	 I can't destroy these. And you're going to get treats and chews in every box too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=80.4s	80.4	 They're giving this away when you sign up for a bark box subscription or super chewer box right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=85.3s	85.3	 My dog looks forward to these boxes every month. And Ursa really prefers this type of memory foam bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=91.1s	91.1	 I'll have a link in the description below where you can sign up for a box and get your free bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 Today is the day. Biscuits is going to learn how to stay in public even when she's distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=101.6s	101.6	 Although if i'm being honest, as we're walking to our training spot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=105.1s	105.1	 I'm reminded that her leash skills are not doing the best right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=110.2s	110.2	 Keep moving. Let's go. This leash walking is a disaster right now. Oh, looks like I lost her here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=116.2s	116.2	 All right, so it's clear that Biscuits has some leash walking boot camp in her future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=119.9s	119.9	 I wonder who's going to take that job on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 Now you might remember a couple of videos ago, we were working with Biscuits on going into her crate automatically and staying there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 And that's great at home. She did well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 But i'm hoping to get her to do something similar, albeit not in a crate, but stay in a position out here at a park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 And that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 significantly more difficult because I don't have total control of the environment out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=142.3s	142.3	 So today I'm hoping to build on that success while also teaching her a seemingly unrelated skill to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 Interesting how one thing builds on another when you're training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 The challenge here is teaching her to keep that little puppy body still even when she sees things that interest her outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 This is a training spot we've used several times at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=161.3s	161.3	 And we love it because we have a pedestrian trail right here and then we have a field in the middle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 So there's a lot of opportunities to teach your dog to listen to you in a fairly distracting setting. Biscuits, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=175.7s	175.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 It looks like our strategy of calling her off of minor distractions at least is working well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=181.5s	181.5	 Last time we had some pretty serious real life leave it issues. I'm glad to see that training is sticking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=189.2s	189.2	 Stick. I'm hoping to teach her to stay in a unique and different way today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=194.1s	194.1	 My wife has brought this cutting board out for us out of our actual kitchen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 The idea here is we want to teach her to want to be in that spot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=202.7s	202.7	 and not to move. Yes. Is it just me or is Biscuits becoming telepathic?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=206.7s	206.7	 So the idea for this lesson is to get her to voluntarily stay in one specific spot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=212.5s	212.5	 regardless of where I am. And in the beginning since she's like getting right into this I might even make it easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=219.5s	219.5	 I'm putting some treats on there. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 Now I hear you. How does teaching her how to stay on this piece of plastic have any benefits? Two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=228.1s	228.1	 First it shows me that her general training is improving and she's starting to see the value of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=233.5s	233.5	 listening to me in public and it also gives me the chance to teach her how to stay still while in one spot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=239.7s	239.7	 even in public. And I'm telling you this is such a vital skill that all dogs need to know. For reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=246.1s	246.1	 that should be pretty obvious. And getting her to think throughout this exercise is a wonderful way to kind of see how her overall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=251.9s	251.9	 reasoning ability is doing too. Remember making a dog do something? That's one thing but making a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=257.1s	257.1	 want to do something? That is quite another thing and I think the latter is much more powerful. All of the reinforcement right now in theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=264.6s	264.6	 is going to come only in that area and when she's on the right track. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=269.4s	269.4	 I want to make sure to reward generously especially for duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 And now while we're starting small say one second on the platform we'll gradually increase that time throughout this session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=279.8s	279.8	 And I'm thinking once she's getting it I should be able to get her to stay on there longer by slowing down the rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=285.4s	285.4	 of which I reward her. I mean that assumes that my prior training is going to have some effect here as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=293.4s	293.4	 Always be sensitive to asking too much of your dog in a lesson like this. I should have released her earlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=299.4s	299.4	 but let's see if she figures out what to do. I mean it's better to get a two second success than it is to get a 10 second almost success and then a failure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=311.5s	311.5	 Yes go to your spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=316.9s	316.9	 At this point it looks like she's really getting the point. So let's change a variable. I'm going to walk away and see if I can catch her succeeding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=324.3s	324.3	 at this farther distance. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=326.6s	326.6	 So this is great but stay doesn't mean much unless they'll do it while distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=330.8s	330.8	 So what I like to do is add a minor artificial distraction in order to prepare them for more real distractions later on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=338.0s	338.0	 Ha I bet she didn't see that coming. Yes. That's right master dog trainer at work folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=344.4s	344.4	 And in this case where her feet come off that plastic it can be tempting to correct her. But remember real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=349.9s	349.9	 authentic learning comes down to a dog learning how to anticipate what we want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=354.5s	354.5	 So I do want to avoid telling her literally every step to make and see if she can figure out what I'm asking for here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=360.9s	360.9	 And to nobody's surprise. Yes. She delivers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=367.4s	367.4	 Yes, I want to be able to dance and jog in place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=371.1s	371.1	 I want to be able to move around and know that she's going to have a reliable stay. Okay. Yes. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=376.6s	376.6	 All
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=378.6s	378.6	 but ultimately let's face it biscuits is going to encounter things that are a lot more exciting and distracting than my dance moves and for most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=386.3s	386.3	 puppies other dogs are one of the hardest things of all to resist. Biscuits is no exception
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=391.9s	391.9	 but we've been training for a moment exactly like this and of course my hope here is that she doesn't advance towards this dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=399.4s	399.4	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=400.8s	400.8	 Yes. So I definitely think it's worth giving her a treat right here as if to say hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 thank you for not approaching that dog biscuits. I know you wanted to. I hope we have a significant distraction. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=413.5s	413.5	 Just trying to avoid her getting too fixated on the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=417.4s	417.4	 This is the miraculous power of reinforcement training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=420.5s	420.5	 Here we are in a public space with a dog who's only existed on earth for just a few months at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=426.1s	426.1	 And over a relatively short period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=428.2s	428.2	 we've been able to not only communicate that we'd like her to go to a spot and stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=432.7s	432.7	 but we've done that in a way that's powerful enough that she's actually starting to choose to do what we want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=439.7s	439.7	 Even in the case where she encounters some really tempting alternatives like other dogs in public. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=446.9s	446.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=448.1s	448.1	 Now I know that I just said resisting other dogs is one of the hardest things you deal with when training a puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=453.4s	453.4	 but I may have spoken too soon because it's time now to see if biscuits is permanently emotionally damaged from her last experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=461.8s	461.8	 taking a bath. When Bri attempted to give her a bath not too long ago, it didn't go well ideally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=470.6s	470.6	 The second she felt that trickle of water she was out. Are you gonna be okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=476.2s	476.2	 Was that a little too scary? Will you ever be able to take a bath again?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=479.9s	479.9	 Now ideally it's great if you can teach your dog to voluntarily go into the tub or the sink
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=484.5s	484.5	 but in this case biscuits is having no part of that. So I'm going to provide some assistance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=489.6s	489.6	 So I think I'm really going to the next step. I need to introduce the Fossey here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=493.6s	493.6	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=496.3s	496.3	 I just wanted to see it. This doesn't bend down too far. Here, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=501.6s	501.6	 Did you let her smell it when you did it? No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=504.5s	504.5	 I kind of turned it on while she was far away from it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=507.4s	507.4	 Well, see this supports that hypothesis too that often when you think you've tried everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=512.2s	512.2	 really there are smaller steps that you can break it down into if you run into trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=516.1s	516.1	 So here I'm just trying to let her little drop like one drop got on her right there. Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=520.7s	520.7	 Because of our past training here, she's learning that holding one position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=525.0s	525.0	 works to her advantage. I'm going to move it around. I'm going to touch her with it. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=529.7s	529.7	 See that she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=531.3s	531.3	 reacting really well. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=534.5s	534.5	 I've got the faucet pointed over here just to keep it less daunting to her because my next step is to turn it on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=539.7s	539.7	 I wanted to see it though. I don't want to catch her off guard. Here. See this? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=547.0s	547.0	 I'm going to let her go explore the water now. She's probably going to be like, what is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=551.4s	551.4	 Yeah, I think she's less nervous and more trying to get to the food over here at this moment. Let's see here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=558.2s	558.2	 See, she's still taking treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=560.0s	560.0	 A sign that she's likely not too nervous. Now, of course I am moving extra slowly. You would be right to pick up on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=566.5s	566.5	 Seriously by going extra slow you ensure lightning fast success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=572.2s	572.2	 I mean if you think about it, this has certainly been true with me in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=575.4s	575.4	 Most setbacks when it comes to grooming or baths or nail trimming and things like that happen because we're trying to do it quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=582.0s	582.0	 At least quickly as far as our dog is concerned. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=585.1s	585.1	 Let's see if we keep it streaming like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=588.6s	588.6	 Now she does continue to pursue exiting the sink here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=591.8s	591.8	 But since she is taking treats, I think that she's going to get the message that bath time has the potential to be more enjoyable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=598.6s	598.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=600.6s	600.6	 See, will she cross over near it? Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=604.4s	604.4	 Well done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=605.8s	605.8	 I'm going to turn it off. So that way it's not like an eternal waterfall that happens. It comes on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=610.4s	610.4	 We turn it off. And since she is a little bit nervous,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=612.9s	612.9	 I think it might be a good idea to probably use a washcloth to clean her up a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=616.5s	616.5	 It looks like the running water is a bit much for her right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=619.6s	619.6	 So we're going to take a step back. But I'm having to troubleshoot here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=623.0s	623.0	 Do you think it's because of the damage that I did? No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=626.4s	626.4	 I know when we first met her, she was really gross. So she obviously had a bath between then and now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=631.9s	631.9	 So I don't know how that experience or experiences went. But that's okay. We're going to make it good. Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=641.1s	641.1	 It's okay. Good girl. What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=644.8s	644.8	 See this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=646.6s	646.6	 Good girl. It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=649.0s	649.0	 Look how warm that is. Let me see if she's even taking treats. Here. Do you want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=654.5s	654.5	 She's taking treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=656.7s	656.7	 Good girl. Very good. So this is similar to the peanut butter idea you had. That's my peanut butter technique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=663.1s	663.1	 Peanut butter wall has never failed me before. Looks like she's a little lower stress now. She's still up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=669.0s	669.0	 Well, you thought of a way to not run the water, which for some reason didn't even occur to me. A sponge bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=675.4s	675.4	 So right now I'm just getting her comfortable with being wiped down. She's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=680.4s	680.4	 super happy, but the idea is over time, hopefully she gets enough of these experiences and she realizes, hey, it's not that bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=687.8s	687.8	 Let me get a little shampoo now. Hello. How are you? You doing okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=693.0s	693.0	 Trying to communicate in the best way that I can as a person that I'm calm. Everything's fine. I care about her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=700.2s	700.2	 I'm not really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=702.1s	702.1	 out to get her. She doesn't understand why we're doing this. Yeah, I mean she's being trusting. She's propped up here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=707.2s	707.2	 but she's not totally trying to jump out. She doesn't seem beside herself with fear at the moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=712.7s	712.7	 Okay, so I think we've isolated the running water as the thing that's Biscuit's least favorite part of this experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=719.8s	719.8	 So by minimizing that aspect, the running water, it looks like she's tolerating this bath a lot better now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=725.3s	725.3	 But we've come this far, so we still have to get this shampoo off of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=729.4s	729.4	 So if I could just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=731.2s	731.2	 rinse her now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=733.7s	733.7	 with this, that might be nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=737.2s	737.2	 Yeah, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=739.4s	739.4	 I think that's enough water so I can sponge rinse her now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=742.6s	742.6	 And you can see that she's definitely feeling a little bit more stress and she doesn't want treats anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=747.4s	747.4	 And we know that generally, at least in this situation, that if a dog stops taking treats where they were previously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=752.5s	752.5	 interested, that that is a sign that they're getting a little bit too uncomfortable to make meaningful progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=757.6s	757.6	 So in this case, I'm doing my best to finish this bath as quickly and painlessly as possible for Biscuit's. Hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=763.9s	763.9	 We're almost done. Okay. I know this is the worst thing ever, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=768.4s	768.4	 You're being so good. I know this is hard. I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=773.0s	773.0	 You're gonna get really good at these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=775.0s	775.0	 But she is calming down now that the water's been turned off. Look how brave she is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=780.0s	780.0	 After she eats, her tummy gets so plump. She kind of feels like a tiny honey baked ham. All done. You did great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=788.0s	788.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=790.2s	790.2	 Let's get you dry. Thanks, Zach. You really pulled through on that one. I mean, I see what you're talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=795.4s	795.4	 Yeah, it wasn't really the smoothest bath, but we got through it and, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=800.2s	800.2	 it's just the kind of thing you have to be sensitive to. Things we could have done better looking back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=804.1s	804.1	 We could have turned this on while I was doing training in the background or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=808.5s	808.5	 You know, like show it to her, give her some treats. Now let's go play some fetch, you know, outside of bath time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=813.4s	813.4	 rather than trying to introduce all of this to her at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=816.9s	816.9	 You know, this is reality that is often the position we find ourselves in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=821.2s	821.2	 I think it's a scientific fact that baths trigger zoomies in about 80% of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=826.5s	826.5	 Legit. Show me your sources. Sounds like fake news to me. It is fake news. I made it up. Here we go. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=833.1s	833.1	 Shake off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=838.3s	838.3	 Oh, actually, I should probably reinforce that, shouldn't I?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=842.8s	842.8	 Yeah, there's the post bath energy we're looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=846.2s	846.2	 It's worth mentioning if Biscuitz was feeling overwhelmed, she does go under the couch, remember?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=854.4s	854.4	 That's what I like to see. Look at that. Ultimate trust behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=862.3s	862.3	 That was even Biscuitz saying, okay, I'm done. I'm gonna take a break and Inertia took the hit really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=867.0s	867.0	 I mean, that's good. Dog to dog communication. Measured, healthy, self-regulating. I like it when that happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=873.0s	873.0	 Sometimes though, we do find ourselves when we're training a puppy having to move more quickly than we would like. Take trimming a puppy's nails, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=880.7s	880.7	 That's something that you ideally would like to do in a single sitting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=883.8s	883.8	 But it has the potential to go way wrong if you move too quickly and potentially set you back years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=890.1s	890.1	 So Biscuitz nails are getting pretty long. They need to be cut. It's towards the end of the day for her right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=895.4s	895.4	 So she's had plenty of exercise, mental stimulation, and hopefully she's going to be in a more relaxed mindset to be tolerant here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=902.6s	902.6	 Should I just kind of go fast? No. We don't want to just go fast. Okay. Let her smell it. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=908.9s	908.9	 Yes, so I'm just letting her nibble on a soft treat that I have here. So we're doing two things with these treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=913.7s	913.7	 We're distracting her and also conditioning her. Like getting her nails clipped means you get the treat. Let her smell it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=919.7s	919.7	 Okay, let her interact with it a little bit. It's clippers. Yes. Good. They're gonna go like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=925.4s	925.4	 Now go ahead and touch her foot. Okay. Good. Yeah, just go ahead and do everything but cut her nails right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=932.0s	932.0	 And then let go before you get resistance from her. But the point is to like it don't just jump into it all at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=937.6s	937.6	 Biscuitz seems pretty unbothered. She's really into the treats too. So that's a good sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=942.3s	942.3	 So I think we're good to try the very first nail clip. I'm gonna do the first one. Just do one and back off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=947.0s	947.0	 Don't try and do two. I'll give you a three, two, one. Uh oh. Did you notice anything there? Biscuitz pulled her paw away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=952.1s	952.1	 So that probably means we're going a little bit too fast. Oh, the squeezy of her paw is throwing her off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=957.3s	957.3	 Oh, good idea. Yeah. Great realization by Brie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=960.2s	960.2	 If you can resist the temptation to just power through when a situation like that arises, in the end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=965.2s	965.2	 you're going to almost certainly have better and faster progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=968.9s	968.9	 It's always nice when you have an extra person to do this with. We always want to show you different ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=972.6s	972.6	 This is pretty smooth. Biscuitz is fine with getting her paw squeezed now. See that didn't take long. Let's go for the clip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=978.3s	978.3	 Three, two, one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=980.2s	980.2	 Good girl. How about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=982.2s	982.2	 Now look at that. Biscuitz doesn't react at all to her very first nail trim, but there are still 19 toes to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=989.8s	989.8	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=991.3s	991.3	 See, so you can see that if you like went in and just jumped into it, some dogs would be like, oh my god, what's happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=996.9s	996.9	 I have done that, honestly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=998.5s	998.5	 I mean, you can only imagine how different this would go if we just focused on restraining her and getting it done super quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1004.4s	1004.4	 But she's really tolerating this like a champ. If you just focus on clipping just a tiny edge tip of their nail,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1010.5s	1010.5	 it's likely to be a lot less stressful for both you and your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1014.2s	1014.2	 And our main goal here is to keep this experience as enjoyable as possible for Biscuitz.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1019.3s	1019.3	 Because now she's going to have that association of having a good time while getting her nails trimmed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1023.2s	1023.2	 She gets a great treat. And hopefully that will be the case in future nail trimming sessions if we keep this up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1028.2s	1028.2	 You have four feet, really? Some feet are more sensitive than others. Some toes are more sensitive than others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1033.0s	1033.0	 We've been through this. But we do have one more curve ball here that throws a lot of dogs off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1038.5s	1038.5	 Oh, the back legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1040.2s	1040.2	 Biscuitz doesn't mind being held on her back and cradled like a baby. Yeah, we'll see how much. Square one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1044.9s	1044.9	 Oh, this isn't so bad. She's pretty into that treat right now. All right, ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1049.2s	1049.2	 One, two, three. Getting her to comply like that took less than one treat throughout that entire session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1055.8s	1055.8	 There we go. Good girl. She did it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1058.1s	1058.1	 This was the size of the treat I was using and this is how much of it is left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1062.6s	1062.6	 So good bit of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1063.7s	1063.7	 She's so into these treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1065.2s	1065.2	 And I think that's going to go a long way towards helping her look forward to getting her nails trimmed in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1069.5s	1069.5	 And when you sign up for a bark box or a super chewer box, you're going to get a free very high quality memory foam dog bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1076.1s	1076.1	 Not to mention the coolest toys and treats every month, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pn-_ag3vE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1078.6s	1078.6	 Subscribe to my channel for more videos like this. Get a copy of both of my books and follow us on Instagram and TikTok, too.
