https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 Tell me in the comments below if you need help with that topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 That's why I'm here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 So make sure you're subscribed and click thumbs up to dogs and cats living in perfect harmony.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 I had the pleasure recently to meet up with the very playful and curious Sadie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Now Sadie's human parents, Arden and Catherine, would like Sadie to show some restraint with the family cat Chloe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 Why do dogs chase cats?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 Because dogs like to chase small furry animals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 She's really interested in that cat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 Whenever I'm asked about problem behaviors that are a result of an outburst of energy, in this case a dog chasing a cat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 the first thing I like to do is try and get the dog exercise to get that energy out of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Let go. Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 See how running from them makes them bring it back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 Oh, come on. What's up? Go get it. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 Ha! Got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Good old fashioned game of keep away, get some into it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 A prerequisite to teaching your dog to leave a cat alone is that A, they know stay, and B, they know stay with mild distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 Check the description for those videos if you need help with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 Do not feel like you need to rush this process at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 It's okay if this takes weeks, even months, but since Sadie's already been through some of this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 it's time to address her direct desire to chase Chloe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 I asked Catherine to put Chloe down to see if Sadie would pursue her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 An overall theme of our training should be encouraging our dogs to look to us for direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 Anytime she starts focusing on Chloe, we want to get her attention over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Look at me initially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 The domestic dog exists because they are so good at taking direction from people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 I find using a really calm voice when introducing a dog to a cat is an important thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 Very good. Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 Right there. Why did I click? Did you catch that? That was a quick moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 I took your attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 Yeah, since I like what Sadie is doing, I will click with my clicker and follow it up with a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 The highest quality and most efficient way to bring about desirable behavior from within your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 is to use a clicker to get the attention of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 The best way to bring about desirable behavior from within your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 is to teach them to do it of their own accord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 But we should resist the urge to touch our dogs, unless we absolutely have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 This is a great example of communicating with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 and bringing about desirable behavior from the inside out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Look at me. Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 Right here, I'm avoiding touching her because I want her to think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 Look at me. You're doing very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Come on. Sadie, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 Sit. No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 And here I'll block her because she's trying to get to the cat. Good. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 Come here. Sit. Uh-uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 Sadie, sit. We're going to be sweet. We're going to be gentle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 Lie down. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Right there. Looking at the cat. Looking at me. I love it when they do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 That's a cat over there and you're staying.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 We just used that food and that clicker on the initial stages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 It was time to see if Arden could do this and get the same results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 Stay here. Here. Here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHrHBZIA5h4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=623&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 Yes. Good girl.
