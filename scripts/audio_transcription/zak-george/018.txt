https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Here's another example of where inertia used to have a hard time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=3.0s	3.0	 This is another barking dog that catches inertia's attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=7.2s	7.2	 When inertia sees a dog actually trying to engage her and bark at her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=10.5s	10.5	 she gets very curious by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=12.1s	12.1	 And in the past, she would bark very heavily in return.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=15.3s	15.3	 But one of the many things that's been very helpful is to acknowledge her good behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=18.8s	18.8	 before one of those events takes place where she starts barking uncontrollably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 Even if she's looking at the dog and that might seem counterintuitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=27.4s	27.4	 But in reality, we're saying, I don't mind you looking at the dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=30.8s	30.8	 but I like the fact that you didn't go over threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=34.4s	34.4	 Yes. Again, marking the fact that she's remaining and keeping herself under threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 That's what the point of that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 I still continue to reinforce her when she behaves well, and I continue to test her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 No tension was needed on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 I think that's worth mentioning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=47.6s	47.6	 It really is just like teaching a child, honestly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqQuLWI4k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 There are more similarities than there are not, at least as it relates to teaching and learning.
