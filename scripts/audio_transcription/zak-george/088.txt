https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 There are a few things that I can teach our new puppy Veronica to make her leash walking easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 Like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=6.5s	6.5	 If you notice with inertia, it's really convenient to have them scoot around and parallel park next to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=12.9s	12.9	 You can more precisely place them, which is great, especially when you're in more urban settings or if you have a reactive dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 We're training our dogs and we're showing you how we do it all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 Subscribe to learn how to train your dog too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 With this, it's a good idea to use a toy or a treat to lure them into an approximation of the position you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=30.2s	30.2	 See, she's still turning in front of me, not at my side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 Yes, fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=36.2s	36.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=36.9s	36.9	 And that actually is more kind of the movement I'm looking for anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 But as we've seen time and time again, when you're training in public, you're bound to come across some unexpected distractions too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 We know that she is sensitive to noises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 We have a transcontinental railroad right here at this wildlife preserve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 Let's see if she'll pay attention to me in the presence of that loud sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 Spoke too soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=58.7s	58.7	 So what does a pro trainer do when they encounter adversity?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 There are several ways to look at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 You can say, screw it and just give up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=66.8s	66.8	 Or you can shift gears and take advantage of the opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=70.4s	70.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 Just see that glance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 Why don't I reward her for small bits of calmness and quiet between these outbursts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 It looks like that train is a bit much for Veronica to take, but she isn't trying to run away and she doesn't seem too overwhelmed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 So that's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=90.4s	90.4	 I'm just going to let her get out of her system and we'll try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=98.4s	98.4	 Can you sit, please?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=99.4s	99.4	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Very nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 OK, let's go this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 Yes, I'm just trying to kind of get her mind off of it before she continues to escalate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 I want to de-escalate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Here, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=118.1s	118.1	 Did you see the look in her eye there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=119.6s	119.6	 I was trying to preempt the bark with, OK, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=122.2s	122.2	 Let's practice this instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=123.6s	123.6	 It's getting real challenging right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=125.8s	125.8	 Let me see if I can get her to do something easier for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=127.9s	127.9	 Like, OK, I don't know, come when called.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 To keep this training session from getting too off the rails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=132.9s	132.9	 OK, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=133.7s	133.7	 She's paying attention to me now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 And now that I have some traction, I want to see if I can make any progress on having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=139.5s	139.5	 her spin into that heel position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 It's a pretty tricky maneuver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=143.4s	143.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 Sorry, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 Calm down, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 The purpose here is to help her get comfortable with the motion and get the muscle memory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 intact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 I think she's getting the hang of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=153.5s	153.5	 She's at this intermediate stage where she'll have an outburst, but you can reason with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 And that train passing was a really good example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=160.4s	160.4	 Because we had taken the time to establish some basic communication,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=163.7s	163.7	 I was able to reason with her a little more effectively, even when she was really thrown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 off by that really unusual thing from her perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 Look at how she's noticing the train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=173.5s	173.5	 And that, to me, is really significant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 When you can get them to intentionally, without any force or anything, pay attention to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=179.9s	179.9	 you're really starting to be able to communicate really effectively with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=183.8s	183.8	 But as you will see with Brie later, dog training can be straight up frustrating at times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 I feel like I'm doing a lot wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=190.1s	190.1	 But I'll show you exactly how we get through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=192.5s	192.5	 Many dog trainers have a saying, and that is, train the dog in front of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=196.5s	196.5	 And that's because each dog is different and requires a tailored approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 But it's not just training that requires a case-by-case approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 We've seen a lot of innovation in different types of dog food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 And Bark Food has one of the best solutions available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 Bark will send you customized, high-quality kibble, supplements, and products based on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=213.7s	213.7	 your dog's specific breed or breed mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 For example, let's just say that you happen to have a Labrador.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=220.5s	220.5	 A lot of Labs I know eat pretty fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=223.1s	223.1	 These are so great for dogs that scarf down their food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=225.9s	225.9	 You can see how this causes them to eat slower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=228.4s	228.4	 They're less likely to upset their stomach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=230.3s	230.3	 And if you've got an active Lab, you definitely want to prevent things like joint issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 Bark Food will recommend a top-notch hip supplement for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=236.8s	236.8	 I love that Bark actually knows what my dogs need before I know it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 What if you've got a different kind of dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=242.5s	242.5	 I don't know, a pit or a pit mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=244.6s	244.6	 Look at this, a Yeti Bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=246.5s	246.5	 They deserve a durable, heavy, high-quality bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=249.7s	249.7	 This might be the highest quality dog food bowl I have ever held in my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=253.6s	253.6	 And a lot of them are prone to skin issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 So Bark recommends these as an add-on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=258.3s	258.3	 Did you say they never go up on the price for the entire lifetime of your dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 No matter what kind of dog you have, they'll help you find the absolute best option they can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 They back that up with a 100% happiness guarantee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=270.5s	270.5	 Use my code ZACHGEORGE30 and you'll get 30% off your first order of Bark Food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=274.9s	274.9	 I'll have details in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=276.7s	276.7	 We are in the Yukon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 It's northwest Canada and it seems like the midnight sun might keep Veronica up all night tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=283.4s	283.4	 I really want to go to sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=284.9s	284.9	 What time is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=285.9s	285.9	 It's light and it's night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=288.9s	288.9	 You guys all are being too loud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=290.7s	290.7	 So I gave her this, but she's still being crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=295.1s	295.1	 So then I gave her this Darth Vader toy and she completely lost her mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=298.3s	298.3	 Well, so much for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=299.6s	299.6	 Oh my god.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=300.4s	300.4	 Can you please go to bed?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=302.7s	302.7	 Why are you like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=304.1s	304.1	 I just took you outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=306.5s	306.5	 Inertia, do you want to come play with the puppy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=308.2s	308.2	 Guys, I'm so tired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=309.2s	309.2	 I don't even feel like I have the mental capacity to calm Veronica down right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=312.9s	312.9	 Hopefully Inertia can help me puppy sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 She's usually really good at getting puppies calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=316.9s	316.9	 Thank you, Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=318.5s	318.5	 Your dog's the best, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=320.1s	320.1	 Thanks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=320.8s	320.8	 I'm really testing the hypothesis that changing our environment often will inspire me to become better at training dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=326.9s	326.9	 And we've stumbled on one of the most secluded, beautiful spots on our entire trip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=332.8s	332.8	 Just look at this glacial river and these gorgeous mountains that we can immerse ourselves in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 Remember when we taught Veronica go to your mark?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=341.5s	341.5	 Well, we, Zach, taught her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=343.1s	343.1	 Honestly, I have not worked on it since.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=346.1s	346.1	 Go to your mark is supposed to be good so I can easily direct Veronica and show her where I actually want her to go in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=353.4s	353.4	 I've been told that if I can get her to understand this one simple thing, it's going to open up a whole new world of communication with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=360.2s	360.2	 Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 I'm going to go take a bath in the river.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=362.1s	362.1	 You look like you're going to go take a bath in the river.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=365.2s	365.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=365.9s	365.9	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=366.5s	366.5	 Oh, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=367.5s	367.5	 I'm using the clicker to mark the exact moment she does something I like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=371.4s	371.4	 Every time I click, I'll give her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=372.9s	372.9	 Zach often says yes instead of clicking, and that works really well, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=375.9s	375.9	 She's a bit distracted by Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=380.8s	380.8	 I wonder what he's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 I think he's singing colors of the wind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 Clearly, Zach is in his own world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=392.8s	392.8	 I guess he's not going to be much help to me right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=395.1s	395.1	 What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=397.7s	397.7	 I'm trying to train my dog, and my husband is really distracting her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=403.4s	403.4	 I know Veronica picked up on this concept before, but I'm having a hard time getting her to figure out what I want here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=408.9s	408.9	 Let me show her as clearly as I can that I want her to put her feet on this little black mat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=415.1s	415.1	 Maybe if I just give her a minute to think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=418.4s	418.4	 OK, that's not working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=419.9s	419.9	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=420.4s	420.4	 Maybe if I move the mark to help bring her attention to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=423.8s	423.8	 I was hoping she'd run right over there after it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=426.7s	426.7	 She is making her way over there very slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=432.1s	432.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=432.5s	432.5	 OK, she touched it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=433.8s	433.8	 Not convinced it was on purpose, but I don't really care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=436.5s	436.5	 Can you remember?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=437.1s	437.1	 Go to your mark, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=439.4s	439.4	 What do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=440.5s	440.5	 Oh, you stood on it accidentally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=442.6s	442.6	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=443.3s	443.3	 I have some thoughts about why this is not working that well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=446.3s	446.3	 Number one, I need practice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=448.2s	448.2	 Number two, I keep moving the mark around, thinking it'll get her attention, but I wonder if maybe I'm confusing her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=454.9s	454.9	 I have a feeling Zach can accelerate this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=456.4s	456.4	 So I got Zach out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=457.9s	457.9	 It seems like there were a number of problems with what I was just doing, and I totally thought I was doing OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=462.9s	462.9	 And it sounds like the first one was I just wasn't giving her enough time to adjust because I wanted to jump right into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=467.9s	467.9	 What did I tell you right before you came out here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=469.8s	469.8	 Give her enough time to adjust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=471.3s	471.3	 He did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=472.4s	472.4	 This is such a hard environment for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=474.6s	474.6	 Whereas before, we taught this on a picnic table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=476.7s	476.7	 Right there, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=477.6s	477.6	 And see how she's frozen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=479.0s	479.0	 Because she really gets this nice sterile surface here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=481.9s	481.9	 There's lots of stuff to investigate on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=484.2s	484.2	 She loves to snuffle around in this campfire stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=487.4s	487.4	 Oh, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=487.9s	487.9	 I'm using the clicker for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=489.7s	489.7	 Remember, click means good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=491.0s	491.0	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=491.7s	491.7	 Here you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=492.2s	492.2	 Sometimes mixing things up and coming at a training session from a different perspective can really help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=497.5s	497.5	 Just clicking for the icon, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=499.1s	499.1	 If I weren't here, Brie could just as easily take a break and try again and have better results on her own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=504.5s	504.5	 But let me see if I can help her accelerate this a bit right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=509.1s	509.1	 After all, I am Zach George, the dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=512.6s	512.6	 Any time she's generally complying with my request or brainstorming in an area that I would like her to be brainstorming in, I'm going to click her and give her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=521.7s	521.7	 I'm just going to move that mark over there because she's making the connection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=524.5s	524.5	 So I'm going to try and up the ante, make it a little more challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=527.4s	527.4	 Waiting for her to get one or two feet on that mat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=530.9s	530.9	 This is so much better than I did and faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=533.5s	533.5	 I feel like I loosen the jar for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=534.9s	534.9	 Just saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=535.6s	535.6	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=535.9s	535.9	 I was first introduced to this skill when I was doing stage work, but you can also use it practically as a way to go to your bed or go to a designated spot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=544.8s	544.8	 There's a million ways you can use this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=546.5s	546.5	 It's a good way to teach them a point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=547.9s	547.9	 I've moved the mark a little bit, so it's in a different place than it was a second ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=552.1s	552.1	 She's like, where did it go?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=553.5s	553.5	 Look how she's thrown off that we moved it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=555.4s	555.4	 She's like, wait a minute, do I still do the same thing even though it's over there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=559.1s	559.1	 How about this? This works sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=561.0s	561.0	 You know that feeling when you walk into the kitchen and you can't remember why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=564.8s	564.8	 So then you make a snack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=566.5s	566.5	 I feel like that's what she just did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=568.6s	568.6	 Because she's a little confused right now, I think I'm going to make it a little easier for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=572.1s	572.1	 I'm trying to really clean up the communication here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=575.1s	575.1	 OK, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=576.4s	576.4	 And I'm doing that by getting as many successful repetitions as I can rather than trying to get Veronica to do a more difficult version right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=583.9s	583.9	 Does she go there on her own to anticipate now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=586.1s	586.1	 That's the moment I'm waiting for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=591.6s	591.6	 There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=592.6s	592.6	 And I want to reward her on the mat in this case to really help spell out to her that this is where I want her attention to be focused right here on that mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=601.3s	601.3	 Where's your mark?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=603.1s	603.1	 This is such a great exercise to do in order to just grow a dog's brain and ability to reason and use logic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=612.3s	612.3	 And it's a great exercise for people, too, because it can really help you tighten up your communication with your dog overall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=618.1s	618.1	 I like that she's staying put here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=620.1s	620.1	 I'm going to capture this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=623.0s	623.0	 I'm going to click and reward encouraging her to hold position because go to your mark often is coupled with staying at the mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=631.8s	631.8	 OK, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=634.5s	634.5	 I think Veronica is starting to get this now, but I can't be sure unless she actually goes to the mark when I ask her to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=643.2s	643.2	 Beautiful example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=644.6s	644.6	 Did you see it was just a hand signal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=646.4s	646.4	 She's responding to the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=647.9s	647.9	 OK, I also like how she's by default holding that position at the mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=653.2s	653.2	 Beautiful example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=654.4s	654.4	 All right, Zach bailed me out on that one, but having to call him in for help has brought up some serious holes in my training with Veronica so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=662.1s	662.1	 I have a shame to admit she's been with us for many weeks now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=666.9s	666.9	 I have not practiced enough and Zach has totally called me out and he's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=671.3s	671.3	 But it's overwhelming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=672.7s	672.7	 I don't even know where to start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=673.8s	673.8	 You have so much to still learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=676.0s	676.0	 I just keep doing the things that I have to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=679.0s	679.0	 Potty training. Check.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=680.5s	680.5	 Did great on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=681.7s	681.7	 The barking. It wakes me up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=683.1s	683.1	 So, oh, check.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=684.3s	684.3	 Oh, no, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=685.1s	685.1	 Oh, my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=686.0s	686.0	 She just tried to eat a bunch of moose poop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=688.5s	688.5	 Gross.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=689.3s	689.3	 But things that aren't mandatory for my sanity are not getting done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=693.7s	693.7	 And that includes things that are mandatory for her safety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=696.7s	696.7	 I'm the one she's tied to every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=698.7s	698.7	 I feel like this is relatable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=699.8s	699.8	 I wanted to vlog it and see what you guys thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=702.6s	702.6	 In addition to calling me out, which needed to be done, Zach has given me a recipe for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=707.3s	707.3	 He said all you have to do is one meal a day, five days a week, always for training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=711.7s	711.7	 Wish me luck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=713.0s	713.0	 There is no magic answer for having a trained dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=715.9s	715.9	 But making sure you practice just a little bit every day is the closest thing I have found to guaranteed success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=722.6s	722.6	 But in the end, the most important thing we can do to improve our dog's training is to bond with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=727.9s	727.9	 Seriously, if Bree just takes a little bit of time to play with Veronica,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=731.5s	731.5	 I suspect she'll start to see the progress she's looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=735.3s	735.3	 There is one other thing I have been working on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=738.6s	738.6	 Frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=739.3s	739.3	 This one's small, but it fits in my pocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=741.5s	741.5	 I wonder if Veronica is going to be more inspired to work with me now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=744.9s	744.9	 I want to try to do spin into heel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=749.9s	749.9	 Trying to just lure her with the frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=753.0s	753.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=754.7s	754.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=755.0s	755.0	 I'm really trying to get her into this position like this on my side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=759.9s	759.9	 Let's try one more all the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=763.1s	763.1	 I don't know if I'm doing that right either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=765.3s	765.3	 I feel like I'm doing a lot wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=766.4s	766.4	 But she lights up for this frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=768.7s	768.7	 When you feel like you aren't connecting with your dog as well as you could,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=771.6s	771.6	 the best thing you can do is try to relax and just play with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=775.6s	775.6	 You might be shocked at how quickly this can actually improve your dog's training overall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=780.2s	780.2	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=780.9s	780.9	 Can you sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=783.2s	783.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=785.0s	785.0	 Give me that frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=786.1s	786.1	 I am sensing a momentum shift.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=788.3s	788.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=788.6s	788.6	 Veronica is getting into that frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=790.3s	790.3	 I do not want to be the reason that this dog doesn't get trained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=792.8s	792.8	 because she has so much potential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=795.3s	795.3	 Ah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=796.3s	796.3	 I still have no idea what I'm doing, but I at least know that she likes it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=800.0s	800.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=800.3s	800.3	 Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=800.7s	800.7	 And a catch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=801.9s	801.9	 Yeah, and she caught it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=803.3s	803.3	 And she caught it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=804.5s	804.5	 Oh my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=805.5s	805.5	 That's a great step forward for Bree and Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=807.9s	807.9	 We've been working on that frisbee catch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=810.2s	810.2	 And even more importantly, look how much fun they're having right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=813.2s	813.2	 I went into this training session expecting to accomplish one thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=817.1s	817.1	 like work on something from start to finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=819.1s	819.1	 But now I'm really feeling like just working with her with this thing that she loves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=822.6s	822.6	 on a bunch of different things without really worrying about specifically accomplishing one right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=827.3s	827.3	 It's the first time that I've actually felt a communication happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=830.7s	830.7	 So that's kind of funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=831.7s	831.7	 Just had to stop and play with her for a little while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=834.3s	834.3	 It's a place to start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=835.3s	835.3	 I just have to figure out how to bridge this into actual training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=839.7s	839.7	 Once you start having genuine fun with your dog like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=842.7s	842.7	 the training often comes really naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=845.0s	845.0	 That's the beauty of play like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=846.3s	846.3	 You can sprinkle all sorts of the training you've been working on into a play session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=850.3s	850.3	 And so your dog is learning and they're having fun at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=853.4s	853.4	 And you can see how this formula will really translate into success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=858.0s	858.0	 I feel like we made some kind of progress here, although I can't say exactly what.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=861.2s	861.2	 A trained dog is the best and it's not that hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=863.5s	863.5	 I've watched Zach do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=864.7s	864.7	 You guys are all here to hold me accountable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=866.6s	866.6	 We'll see what she learns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=868.8s	868.8	 Got his teapot full of glacier water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0fbMF3Yxs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=871.5s	871.5	 Sometimes husbands and wives disagree.
