https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQGChJ_L3zo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=105&pp=iAQB&t=3.7s	3.7	 so I want to give her another chance to play with Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQGChJ_L3zo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=105&pp=iAQB&t=17.3s	17.3	 Seems like Inertia's ready to do whatever it takes to get Veronica to play, though.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQGChJ_L3zo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=105&pp=iAQB&t=29.2s	29.2	 It looks like Inertia had the right idea sharing her toy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQGChJ_L3zo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=105&pp=iAQB&t=36.6s	36.6	 Uh-oh. Maybe a little too brave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQGChJ_L3zo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=105&pp=iAQB&t=38.7s	38.7	 Huh? I've seen this before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQGChJ_L3zo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=105&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 Good girl, Inertia. Don't worry, we'll teach her how to share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQGChJ_L3zo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=105&pp=iAQB&t=43.3s	43.3	 Well, it looks like Veronica is really coming out of her shell now.
