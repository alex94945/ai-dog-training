https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=2.3s	2.3	 In this episode, I'm going to show you how to teach your dog to enjoy things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=6.1s	6.1	 that they probably naturally won't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 Click thumbs up for Sky Blue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=9.9s	9.9	 Make sure you're subscribed to my channel and pick up a copy of my book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=12.9s	12.9	 so that you can show your dog how to become a success in life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=16.5s	16.5	 For things like cleaning your dog's ears or brushing your dog's teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=19.7s	19.7	 Don't wait until it's time to get the job done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=22.3s	22.3	 Instead, commit to several training sessions to get them comfortable with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 That way, when the time does come, both you and your dog will be prepared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 I know you hunt ducks, but you can't bite me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=32.8s	32.8	 I'm not a duck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 Savage dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=34.9s	34.9	 You're on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=35.8s	35.8	 Thousands of people are watching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=37.5s	37.5	 Our challenge today will be to see how far we can get with getting Sky Blue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=40.5s	40.5	 comfortable with having your ears cleaned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=42.1s	42.1	 It is so super common for dogs to get things like ear infections or hematomas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 And the best way to guard against that is to keep their ears clean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 So if you just rush into cleaning your dog's ears,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=52.1s	52.1	 it's probably not going to go that well, and it's going to make things difficult
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=55.3s	55.3	 in the future because dogs remember experiences like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 These dog ear wipes and dog ear cleaner from Pet Post are really fantastic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=62.9s	62.9	 because they don't have so many of those harsh ingredients
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 that you see in other products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 And they're alcohol free, which means they're not going to burn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 or dry out your dog's ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 In fact, there's only seven ingredients in the entire product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=73.2s	73.2	 Things like coconut oil and aloe, which will keep microbes and bacteria at bay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 That's always good news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 Pet Post has tons of great products for cats and dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=81.3s	81.3	 Enter code Zach George when you check out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=83.2s	83.2	 And they're going to give you 15 percent off of your entire purchase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 Not just these ear cleaners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=88.4s	88.4	 I'm going to have the link and the details in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=91.1s	91.1	 The first thing I want to do is make sure that Sky Blue is comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=94.4s	94.4	 with having her ears touched.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 I'm going to flip your ear flap up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 I'm going to touch it like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=99.2s	99.2	 I can touch the inside of her ears here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=101.9s	101.9	 Can even touch them over here a little bit more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 I mean, a little firm here just to make sure that she's not super sensitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=108.6s	108.6	 I want to touch her from behind the ears, make sure she's super comfortable there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=112.1s	112.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 If your dog wasn't quite this tolerant, that would be your cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 to take a step back and get them used to being touched firmly over the next few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=119.8s	119.8	 weeks or so. This is a great start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 I'm going to start with the ear wipes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 See how she's smelling them? I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=125.1s	125.1	 I'm going to go ahead and treat her for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=126.7s	126.7	 The reason I'm doing that is I want to do everything I can to have her associate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=132.4s	132.4	 getting her ears clean with getting great treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 I want her to think of them as one in the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=137.3s	137.3	 So rather than just take an ear wipe out and start cleaning her ear,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=140.5s	140.5	 I'm just going to open the cap and then I'm going to set it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 I'm just going to give her a treat just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 If you've ever opened a bag of treats for your dog, you'll know how they react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=149.6s	149.6	 They get excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=150.3s	150.3	 They associate that plastic sound of the treats opening with getting treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 I'm trying to accomplish a similar thing with these ear wipes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 So open it. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=159.2s	159.2	 And treats. See that she looked at the ear wipes and then she looked at the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 Let her smell it. These have a really pleasant smell to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=166.7s	166.7	 Just like with people, we often tend to associate certain smells with certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 experiences. Now I'm going to take an ear wipe out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=173.7s	173.7	 They're super saturated with ear cleaner. What if these work on people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=177.3s	177.3	 That is pleasure. I can hear everything so much better now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 Go get your own ear cleaner. I'm not just going to go straight into her ear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 Number one, she can't really see over there and that's very likely to throw her off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 So I'm going to touch her paw and look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 you saw how she pulled away just when I touched her paw with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=192.1s	192.1	 So I want to make sure that I let her know it's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 You can nibble a little bit of that turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=196.4s	196.4	 I'm going to come underneath her chin here a little bit. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=199.5s	199.5	 Just to touch her with it. Most dogs are comfortable being touched under their chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=203.3s	203.3	 So that allows her to really see what's going on. It's okay. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=207.8s	207.8	 Nice work. Come on. Come here. Sit. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 Touch her. Yeah. Touch her head and see while I'm going to let her nibble on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 here while I just touch her all over with it. Just let her know, Hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=221.4s	221.4	 when you get touched with this, it means you're getting turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=226.6s	226.6	 See how that works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=227.7s	227.7	 Now let me see if I can touch the outside of her ear before touching the inside of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 her ear. Cause that's less sensitive. See that while I've got some good momentum,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 I'm going to try and get inside the flap of her ear on the outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=238.6s	238.6	 Look at her twitch in there. Oh, you're being so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=241.8s	241.8	 I'm not really trying to thoroughly clean her ears right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=244.4s	244.4	 as much as I am trying to get her comfortable with having these wipes touching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=247.8s	247.8	 her ears. Using great treats when doing this is pretty essential cause look how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=252.4s	252.4	 cooperative she's being. She's noticing it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=254.9s	254.9	 but she's not so stressed out that she's like, Oh no, I can't tolerate this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=259.5s	259.5	 What are you doing? I'm actually able to kind of get in there. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 If you find it too awkward to kind of touch your dog's ears and give them treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=266.4s	266.4	 at the same time, you could always enlist the help of a friend or a partner too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=270.3s	270.3	 These ear wipes are particularly good for small dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=272.9s	272.9	 but if you have a bigger dog, you might need to use a little bit more solution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 This would be a really good place to stop for your first training session,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=278.9s	278.9	 but sky blue is doing a pretty good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=280.8s	280.8	 I think it's time to give the liquid ear cleaner a shot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=283.3s	283.3	 which is going to be a little more challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=285.3s	285.3	 The best way to use this cleaner is to get this liquid inside their ear. Now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=289.4s	289.4	 obviously that can be a little unsettling for many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=292.3s	292.3	 So rather than just squirting this in her ear,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=294.6s	294.6	 I'm going to saturate this cotton ball and then get it in her ears by squeezing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=298.2s	298.2	 the cotton ball. And since I've changed it up a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=300.3s	300.3	 I'm going to touch her a little bit here. I'm going to touch her right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 I'm going to touch her there. Good girl. By the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=305.9s	305.9	 there is an art here to letting your dog nibble the turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=309.1s	309.1	 If you have a big old chunk of turkey like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=311.3s	311.3	 you can just kind of feed it through little by little and just let them get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=314.1s	314.1	 tiny amounts. I'm squirting it in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=316.8s	316.8	 Now I'm going to massage it a little bit over here. Oh, you're so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 I think she likes it. She's having a great time. And again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 letting her nibble turkey the entire time. Now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=325.9s	325.9	 I suspect she's probably going to shake off here in a second. There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 It gets in there, it does its job. And then a lot of that stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=332.9s	332.9	 yucky stuff gets dislodged when they shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=335.2s	335.2	 So it's super important to get in there and dry your dog's ears out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=338.2s	338.2	 As long as your dog is taking treats while you do this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=340.9s	340.9	 that's a sign that they're not too overly stressed.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 Now what we want to do is see if we can get her comfortable. When we squirt it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=348.4s	348.4	 this nozzle here is optimized to really be able to get into your dog's ear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=352.2s	352.2	 That's going to be the most efficient way to get her ears clean in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDLcgzFXios&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=355.4s	355.4	 Another variable change here. So I'm going to, she's like, Hey,
