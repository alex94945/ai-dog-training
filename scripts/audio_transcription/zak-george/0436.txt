https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 Celebrity dog trainer and America's Got Talent sensation, Sarah Carson, is here with her dog Marvel today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 Today we're going to show you the main steps you need to take to make your dog a frisbee superstar,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=19.5s	19.5	 Click thumbs up for Sarah Carson and her dog Marvel, subscribe to my channel, and pick up a copy of my book

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 There's no need to inconvenience yourself if you don't have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=30.5s	30.5	 Simplify your life and get your dog's food automatically shipped to you from Pet Flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=34.4s	34.4	 You can have your dog's food automatically shipped to you in any time interval you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=38.3s	38.3	 You just choose your dog's favorite brand of food, decide how often you want it to be delivered,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 and enter code ZACH30 when you check out, and you'll get $10 off your first three orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 I'm going to have a link and the details in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 Sarah Marvel is an incredible trick dog, but she does other things too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=52.8s	52.8	 Yes, her favorite activity is playing frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 Was Marvel always interested in toys or did you really have to spark her interest in it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 Marvel actually surprisingly would not even interact with a frisbee when I got her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 but she quickly grew to love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 Show us how you got her interested in the frisbee because that can be the toughest part sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 Totally. I like to start with two frisbees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=71.5s	71.5	 So when she does have one, I can trick her with the other one to try and get her to come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=75.9s	75.9	 You ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=76.4s	76.4	 We get her interested by just dragging it on the floor, get her going to chase it around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=80.1s	80.1	 hopefully grabbing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=81.3s	81.3	 And so what should people do when their dog grabs onto the frisbee?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 You want to tug with it to make it really fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=87.5s	87.5	 A tug for so many dogs is so gratifying. It keeps the game so exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=91.8s	91.8	 And so if you can really get a good game of tug going with the frisbee, that's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 And then get her to drop it by showing you the other one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=96.6s	96.6	 Yeah, nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 But you got to watch your hands too, but her aim's pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=100.5s	100.5	 And in general, it's not usually a good idea to use food when you're teaching something like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 frisbee because most dogs are not going to be quite as amped up or as excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 You really want your dog enthusiastic and excited about the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 So really getting them into that tug mode is a good idea for the vast majority of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 Don't be discouraged if you're working with your dog at home and they're just like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 meh, I'm not that into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=120.7s	120.7	 It's normal for it to take weeks, sometimes months with some dogs to get them interested in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 So once your dog's gotten interested in the frisbee, you got to teach them how to grab it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 Again, we're going to use two. We're going to do something called takes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 You want them to just take it without you having to move it around and make it all animated and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=134.8s	134.8	 just get them to grab it while it's completely still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=138.9s	138.9	 Yes. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=140.8s	140.8	 Man, you're nuts, Marvel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 Now is the pivotal moment where you actually attempt to get your dog to catch the frisbee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=147.8s	147.8	 But you know, a lot of people, they'll just go and throw the frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=150.6s	150.6	 Explain what's wrong with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=151.6s	151.6	 Your dog has no idea what they're doing yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=153.4s	153.4	 I mean, how are they supposed to know to chase it, hunt it down, grab it out of the air before it drops?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 Yeah. You really want to work up to it until your dog's catching it at one foot, two feet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 three feet, and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 So you go from the takes to just hovering it in the same place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 So your dog actually is still doing a take, but you're not holding it anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 And the hover throw is a little tricky sometimes if you're not used to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 So it takes a little bit of practice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=173.5s	173.5	 Don't be discouraged if you can't hover it in place like that at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=177.1s	177.1	 And now the idea basically is to get them to do a take while you're not holding it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=181.6s	181.6	 They almost accidentally catch it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=182.9s	182.9	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=183.4s	183.4	 Your dog just goes for the disc in any way you celebrate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 So they've just made the greatest catch of all time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 It's all about their effort, not whether or not they catch it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 So we've gone over how to get your dog interested in the frisbee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=194.5s	194.5	 how to get them to take the frisbee, and now they're catching it in the air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=197.4s	197.4	 This next part is something that most people don't think to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=199.7s	199.7	 Yeah, the next step would be to teach my dog to go around me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 Okay, and explain what's so important about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=204.5s	204.5	 You're setting your dog up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=205.6s	205.6	 So when the dog runs around, they'll see the frisbee out here and they'll run and look at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 Yeah, so that they'll be encouraged to go in that straight line when you do want to launch it 50 yards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=213.4s	213.4	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=214.2s	214.2	 Meters, as you say in Canada.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 So if your dog's facing you, as most dogs do, and you go to throw a par,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=220.3s	220.3	 they do a quick awkward turn that could be troublesome to many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 So it's good to just set them up straight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 I taught it by just luring my dog with the frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=227.5s	227.5	 And I would reward them when they come around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=228.9s	228.9	 So good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=230.4s	230.4	 So I like how you took a step back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=232.1s	232.1	 You're not throwing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 You're saying come around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=233.9s	233.9	 This is a new element.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=235.1s	235.1	 Now take it because that's really easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=237.4s	237.4	 Now that she's mastered, come around and take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=239.6s	239.6	 The idea is to see if she can catch it in the air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=242.6s	242.6	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=243.4s	243.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 And of course, if your dog's doing this for the first time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=246.5s	246.5	 you're just going crazy if your dog's catching a frisbee like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=249.7s	249.7	 There's so many awesome tricks that you can teach with frisbee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 like a multiple segment, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 That's where you rapid fire frisbees one after the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=256.9s	256.9	 The first time I saw a dog do a multiple segment like that, I was hooked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=260.4s	260.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=260.8s	260.8	 That is the coolest thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 But then I saw a foot stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPGkH3Dm7Yo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=437&pp=iAQB&t=263.8s	263.8	 Yeah.
