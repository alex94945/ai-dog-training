https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=223.2s	223.2	 our instinct as people very often

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 and say, hey, pay attention to me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 to be a pretty clumsy process with a brand new puppy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=286.6s	286.6	 Yes, good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=299.8s	299.8	 That's where it starts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=300.9s	300.9	 This is called redirecting your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=303.0s	303.0	 And it's something you have to get really good at,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=304.8s	304.8	 especially with a puppy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=308.7s	308.7	 And again, hey, Tiberius.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=319.3s	319.3	 like that and you don't want him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 I mean, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=321.4s	321.4	 He's just ready to get me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=323.3s	323.3	 So, all right, so he's biting on my arm right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 Let me get his attention on this toy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEw1h1nr-E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=425&pp=iAQB&t=345.1s	345.1	 if they're barking at something outside
