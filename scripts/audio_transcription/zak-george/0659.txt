https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF1Wb_94_ec&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=660&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 There are a few ways to teach this. One of the ways that I like teaching this is first teach back up, then teach spin, and then focus on combining those two tricks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF1Wb_94_ec&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=660&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 So it's back up, back up, back up. Good. Obviously rewarding her with her currency. The frisbee. Good. Let go. Good. Back up, back up. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF1Wb_94_ec&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=660&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 Good. Now, taking advantage of that focus. Come here. Stay. This way. Good. So I kind of combine those. It's kind of like spin back up. You see?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF1Wb_94_ec&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=660&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Another way that you might want to try this is just luring your dog through your legs initially just to teach them the concept of going between your legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF1Wb_94_ec&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=660&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 So in conclusion, it's spin, spin. Then it's spin back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF1Wb_94_ec&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=660&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 It could take anywhere between a few days and a few weeks to teach this to your dog depending on your current level of communication with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF1Wb_94_ec&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=660&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 But as long as you keep it fun for them and you really cater to what their desire is, then you should teach this sooner rather than later.
