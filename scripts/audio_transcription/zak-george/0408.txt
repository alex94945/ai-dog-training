https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=2.7s	2.7	 Click thumbs up for chestnut and make sure you're subscribed to my channel too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=6.4s	6.4	 One of the reasons we love dogs so much is because they enrich our lives so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=10.8s	10.8	 But when we have to go to work or leave them alone, what can we do to keep them from getting bored?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=15.7s	15.7	 In order for dogs to feel content, they need to be engaged often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=18.7s	18.7	 You can do that through general training, exercise, by giving them great chew toys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=22.5s	22.5	 but dogs do best when they interact with people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=24.9s	24.9	 Bang!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 Oh dramatic play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=29.1s	29.1	 That was really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=30.1s	30.1	 But when you have to be away from the house, this can be difficult to accomplish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=33.2s	33.2	 You might be the smartest American Cocker Spaniel I've ever met.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=35.7s	35.7	 One of my favorite new things that can help make life easier is the Furbo Dog Camera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=39.6s	39.6	 It's a treat tossing camera designed exclusively for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=43.5s	43.5	 It's got to be the coolest high tech dog invention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 We have so much fun with this around here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=48.1s	48.1	 The Furbo Dog Camera makes it so easy to not only keep an eye on your dog whenever you need to check in on them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 but to also interact with them in an amazing way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 From your phone, you can see your dog in HD and you can hear them too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=58.9s	58.9	 And if you tap this button right here, you can actually toss a treat to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=62.8s	62.8	 Since Furbo makes sounds, I want to get Chestnut really comfortable with those sounds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=66.8s	66.8	 and I also want him to equate that sound with getting a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=70.6s	70.6	 It's empty at the moment because I want to toss the treats to really ease him into the whole concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 Right there, there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=78.4s	78.4	 I'm going to do this maybe 10 times or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 If your dog actually starts sitting when they hear Furbo,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=82.7s	82.7	 that's a good sign that they're really making the connection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=85.4s	85.4	 Because, you know, dogs have been taught for the most part how to sit for a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=88.4s	88.4	 It looks like Chestnut's really making the connection here that that sound means he's getting a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=92.7s	92.7	 So I think we're ready to move on to the next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=94.5s	94.5	 Now it's time to actually toss a treat out of Furbo and see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 Oh, he loved it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 Let's try and do that a couple of times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=102.1s	102.1	 Furbo worked closely with vets and trainers to really optimize Furbo Dog Camera just for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 So, for example, this high pitched sound that you hear the Furbo make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=110.6s	110.6	 That's going to get a lot of dog's attention, as you can clearly see with Chestnut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 But maybe your dog responds even better to your own voice or some crazy voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 You can record any sound you like to let your dog know a treat is coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 This is a fun feature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 Let's see how it sounds now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 Hey, Furbo, come get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=125.2s	125.2	 Furbo, come get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 As a trainer, this opens up so many different possibilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 I wonder what will happen if we use the squeak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 Let's see if the Furbo gets his attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 Let's see if the Furbo gets his attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=142.1s	142.1	 That's good. I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 And the treats don't just drop out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 I mean, they're tossed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 Things with motion are much more likely to capture a dog's attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=149.1s	149.1	 This is a fantastic way to keep a dog mentally stimulated when they're at home alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 While you're at work, you can check on them to see what they're up to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 and you can really engage with them, almost as if you were there with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 By the way, did I mention you can actually talk to your dog through Furbo too?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=162.2s	162.2	 Good boy, Seth Nutt. Good job, buddy. You're doing so great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 One major side effect of boredom is excessive barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 This has got to be my favorite smart feature of Furbo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=172.4s	172.4	 Furbo can detect barking and alert you so that you can quickly check in on your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 and see what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 Let's see it in action. Speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 Yeah, I just got a notification.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 You're not going to find that everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 So say, for example, your dog was barking while you were away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 The Furbo is fantastic for you to get their attention on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=188.4s	188.4	 You can talk to them through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 And then if they're quiet for just a moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 you can reinforce that good, quiet behavior with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=195.8s	195.8	 Unlike other home monitors that send general motion and sound alerts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 Furbo smart alerts only notify users of dog related events.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 So Furbo will send an alert when it identifies continuous activities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 like a dog pacing back and forth, licking feet or moving around the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 In addition to letting you know when your dog is active,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=211.6s	211.6	 it's a really good way to identify boredom and characteristics of separation anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=215.8s	215.8	 For example, when your dog wakes up from a nap and starts moving around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=218.8s	218.8	 you'll get a notification and you can decide at that time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 whether or not you want to reward your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=222.8s	222.8	 And this is a way to discourage excessive napping during the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=225.7s	225.7	 so that your dog is more likely to stay on a reliable sleep schedule at night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=229.7s	229.7	 One of the magical features about Furbo is that if you have an Alexa,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 you can schedule it to toss treats at any given time interval,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=236.3s	236.3	 say every two hours, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 Furbo is an awesome way to make the day much more enriching and exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=241.6s	241.6	 for your dog while they spend a few hours alone to guard against boredom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=244.5s	244.5	 and even help prevent mild separation anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 Furbo dog camera is an incredible, innovative device
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 that helps improve your dog's quality of life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 while allowing you to be with them even when you can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=254.8s	254.8	 If you know anyone with a dog and you need a gift for them, Furbo is it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 I'm going to have a link to Furbo dog camera in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=260.8s	260.8	 Just enter code FurboZack when you check out for $25 off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9P95frZF4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=409&pp=iAQB&t=264.7s	264.7	 Chestnut, you did a good job today.
