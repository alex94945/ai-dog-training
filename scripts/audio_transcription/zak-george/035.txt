https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I must weigh in on this debate that's going around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=3.2s	3.2	 So the latest version of the don't exercise your dog too much or they will become too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=8.2s	8.2	 athletic and you won't be able to keep up with their needs and desires.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=11.9s	11.9	 Thing is back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=14.2s	14.2	 I train dogs like and follow for more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 It seems that many dog training professionals are of the mind that exercising a dog frequently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 is just going to encourage them to have more and more stamina and that this ultimately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 just keeps going and it's unsustainable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=28.9s	28.9	 So if you're an average person, you're making your job more difficult by creating an in-shape
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=34.4s	34.4	 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=35.4s	35.4	 How do you guys feel about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=36.4s	36.4	 I think everyone has a measure of what a trained dog is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=39.7s	39.7	 Some people are going to prioritize a dog's obedience and physical response over the dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 feelings and mental well-being.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 And I think that's kind of what's always rubbed me a little bit wrong about this type of advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 in that it favors the human sometimes to an unreasonable degree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=56.6s	56.6	 If we're viewing training our dogs as a true partnership, we have to consider those needs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 Now I'm not saying our dog shouldn't know how to settle down and chill out and relax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 on request, but it's really just this underlying way of looking at this issue that really deserves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 consideration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Let's do a thought experiment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 Let's say we've got a moderately active, pretty energetic dog and let's say we only exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 them twice a week when four might be better suited for this dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=81.5s	81.5	 You really have two major options and obviously there's a spectrum between those two options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=85.9s	85.9	 On one end you could focus on suppressing that energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=88.7s	88.7	 On the other end you could focus on giving your dog a natural and acceptable way to dispense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=94.7s	94.7	 of that energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 You see, exercise is not just about tiring dogs out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=100.1s	100.1	 Humans can relate with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 The endorphins that are released during exercise can be very beneficial in many ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=105.9s	105.9	 Serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin all are very beneficial for both learning and bonding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=111.3s	111.3	 So if our dogs are happy and they're calmer post exercise, that means A, you've satisfied
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 them and B, you have set them up for the most productive training session of their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=123.6s	123.6	 A freshly exercised dog is a way that I try to make dog training easier for myself when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=129.1s	129.1	 I have a hyperactive dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 An exercised dog is less likely to be destructive or bored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=134.1s	134.1	 One of the benefits I've enjoyed of exercise is you get increased socialization opportunities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=138.8s	138.8	 So when you're playing fetch in new places, your dog gets to experience new places when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=143.4s	143.4	 in that pleasant state of mind and even post exercise in that calm state of mind, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=149.2s	149.2	 allows them to absorb new environments a lot more efficiently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=153.8s	153.8	 Sometimes people are skeptical that positive dog trainers don't work with high drive dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 when really high drive dogs are a dream for positive reinforcement trainers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 Why do you think so many people get high drive dogs for dog sports?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 Because they're the easiest to train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=168.5s	168.5	 Which makes it an extra red flag if people need to use aversive dog training techniques
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=173.6s	173.6	 with those highly motivated dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=175.8s	175.8	 I'm not saying that we all need to be perfect when it comes to making sure that our dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=179.6s	179.6	 get that regular physical activity, but we should always keep in mind the optimal route.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 I think virtually everyone with a dog is willing to strive and give their dog some time and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 attention to optimize that dog's life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=190.8s	190.8	 And so the message of 2023 in dog training so far has been, are we considering the dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=196.1s	196.1	 emotional state enough when we're setting them up to learn new things?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 But all dogs, regardless of their condition, after significant physical activity, require
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=203.7s	203.7	 recovery time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=205.2s	205.2	 So every day isn't usually necessary even for high drive dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=209.3s	209.3	 So what I'm saying is an hour of exercise four days a week is probably going to be good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=214.9s	214.9	 for a whole lot of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 There will be some that require a little more than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 And some don't require anywhere near that much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=221.7s	221.7	 And it's definitely possible to over exercise a dog and cause issues later in their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=226.3s	226.3	 So it is important for us to be somewhat conservative and take precautions when we're exercising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=231.5s	231.5	 But if you strike that optimal amount of activity, there's a lot of benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 Your dog's probably going to have a healthy weight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=237.1s	237.1	 They're probably going to have healthy muscles and bones and joints.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 A dog who's in shape, just like people, are less likely to have long-term health problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=244.6s	244.6	 And I think these are pretty significant issues to consider before we advise that people not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=250.2s	250.2	 exercise an energetic dog anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 My advice would just be to exercise your dogs in proportion to their needs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 A lot of dogs are content with a 15 minute walk or less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=260.5s	260.5	 So on the spectrum, where do you guys fall on this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=262.9s	262.9	 Do you go out of your way to try and provide adequate exercise for your dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=267.1s	267.1	 One of the best ways to make sure you're getting the most out of your dog's exercise and their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=270.7s	270.7	 training is to make sure you're giving them a really good food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 Completely frozen.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 So you put them in your freezer and Nom Nom makes this fresh food that's optimized specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=280.4s	280.4	 It's all pre-portioned and ready to go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5YX8BjzUvE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=36&pp=iAQB&t=285.5s	285.5	 dog's regular diet so that they get some fresh food.
