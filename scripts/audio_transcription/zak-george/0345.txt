https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 I'm gonna show you some of the steps you need to take to get your dog to listen to you everywhere without a leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 This is a long lead. This is imperative to off leash training now notice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=81.2s	81.2	 This is not a retractable lead at all. You might also notice too. I'm using a harness out here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 That's gonna be really important because if your dog gets to the end of the lead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 You don't want them having that pressure around their neck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=91.5s	91.5	 See the beauty of a lead like this lies in its simplicity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 You can let your dog drag it behind them and it makes them much easier to get to when you're doing training at a distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=100.2s	100.2	 Or in an outdoor less or uncontrolled environment like this. It's windy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=104.4s	104.4	 I can hear a lawn equipment in the background very distracting unsecure place to train a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 That's why you'll need to make sure you have total control of the environment now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=112.3s	112.3	 Of course if you ever hope to have a dog that listens to you off leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=115.2s	115.2	 They'll need to come to you off leash and a lead like this really empowers you to do that type of training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=121.4s	121.4	 I'm just really playing with her to really keep her into me right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 And since she's so willing to play tug-of-war we're gonna do it because she's paying attention to me and not everything else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 That's going on around us. I love that in a young dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=132.5s	132.5	 You'll need to teach your dog how to come to you no matter where you are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 And that's an essential part of off leash training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 But it's kind of hard to practice if you just let your dog off leash and hope they come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=142.2s	142.2	 That's the worst way to train this to your dog Athena come good. All right. She only came to me for a few inches away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=147.9s	147.9	 I'll take that I'm using some good treats today Athena come good job. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=153.2s	153.2	 Good work. All right, come on back here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 Good and sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=158.4s	158.4	 Athena come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=159.8s	159.8	 Good nice job. Good girl. So when you're teaching your dog to come to you, it's important to use an enthusiastic inviting happy voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 Athena's doing really well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=168.9s	168.9	 I'm really tolerating her jumping on me and all that right now because the fact that she's coming to me outweighs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=174.2s	174.2	 The fact that she's jumping on me. See she's got a little crazy biting at the lead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=177.8s	177.8	 That is one of the side effects here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=179.2s	179.2	 So I'm just gonna distract her have her go into a sit make her hold that for a moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 And so right there she was just wandering around she came to me automatically so I went ahead and rewarded her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 That's really important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=188.9s	188.9	 Even if you don't ask your dog to come to you if they come to you outside like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 Always reward them in the early stages because right now I may as well not even have her on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=197.4s	197.4	 She doesn't even know there's a leash attached
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 But that's no reason to skip it because you never know when something is gonna throw your dog off now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=203.7s	203.7	 I'm gonna start introducing distractions artificially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=206.4s	206.4	 You don't want to wait for a natural distraction to emerge during your training to then just hope it goes well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=211.8s	211.8	 So you got to prepare your dog see what happens here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=214.8s	214.8	 Athena come Athena come here. I want her to abandon this and not pursue it at all when I throw it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=220.4s	220.4	 So let's try it again. Let's see if we can work through this this time. I'm not just gonna throw it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 Ah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 Athena
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=233.4s	233.4	 Leave it alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=236.4s	236.4	 Look at this yes slow. I'm going to lure her away up over here come on sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=242.2s	242.2	 Yes, good. Did you see how we broke that down into a really easy version for her?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 So it wasn't so overwhelming we didn't just throw it and say come on forget about that distraction. We're walking her through the steps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=253.2s	253.2	 She's really curious about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=255.3s	255.3	 Athena come here sit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=260.8s	260.8	 Come

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=269.9s	269.9	 Movement that time she's looking at me. I'm gonna go ahead and reward her just cuz she checked in with me come on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 Yes, good work. I'm gonna bring more movement to the toy the more movement there is the more distracting it is leave it alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 Oh

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=290.1s	290.1	 Come good. Oh that was wonderful. You could see a reach really deep and self-correct there that was perfect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 So I'm gonna go ahead and give her a jackpot reward which means lots of real small pieces of great tasting treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 This is just after a few attempts. She's really starting to make progress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=305.1s	305.1	 Come here. Nope. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=308.0s	308.0	 Perfect that was really good right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 She's really starting to get it right now and because we have her on lead we're able to do a lot of this with peace of mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=316.4s	316.4	 While keeping her safe and preventing all those bad habits like running away from us even getting started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=321.9s	321.9	 Athena come nope

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=330.7s	330.7	 Athena come yes, good girl. Now you're getting it aren't you and so before I was struggling with throwing it that way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=336.3s	336.3	 So, let me see if we can get that now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 Athena come no when I threw it that way. She's like, oh the rules don't apply when you throw the toy that way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=343.5s	343.5	 That's why you have to practice this in so many different ways and in different circumstances
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=349.7s	349.7	 Athena come

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=352.8s	352.8	 Athena come on. Yes. Good job. So you saw there?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=362.2s	362.2	 Way also getting low to the ground like that really helps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=365.2s	365.2	 I've been working with Athena on stay for a period of time and when I'm really up close to her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=369.6s	369.6	 But I'd like to see if we can do a bit better on stay with distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=372.4s	372.4	 If I tell her to stay right now and I walk away watch what happens stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=376.4s	376.4	 See she immediately starts to follow me. Let's make that easier for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 I'll take one step back at a time and acknowledge when she succeeded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=383.8s	383.8	 So I'm gonna come back to her and reward her when she stays while I walk away stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnCXS_zP5k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=346&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 Back here so right there she didn't do what I wanted. That's my fault for pushing her too quickly stay
