https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 She's very intrigued by those horses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=2.2s	2.2	 Whoa, whoa, what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=4.2s	4.2	 Have you been wondering how Inersha is doing around other dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Me too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=8.2s	8.2	 In this episode, we'll check on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 We'll also check on her awesome trick training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 and see how she continues to do around extreme distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=15.8s	15.8	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 I train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=18.1s	18.1	 This is my new dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=22.1s	22.1	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 You can start from the beginning or you can pick up anywhere.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=36.7s	36.7	 This is Inersha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=38.4s	38.4	 Welcome to the Dog Training Experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 If you've been watching the series, you guys probably know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=44.5s	44.5	 that I always say it takes lots of practice to have a super trained dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 But did you know that it only takes about 30 days

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 in order to be able to teach your dog anything you want?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=55.7s	55.7	 I have a completely 100% free digital dog training class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=59.6s	59.6	 that will make it super easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=61.1s	61.1	 Yes, it's actually free, the entire thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=64.3s	64.3	 30 Day Perfect Pup is an online course and an app

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=75.5s	75.5	 a downloadable guide and access to an exclusive private Facebook community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 There's even an app called the Pupford app that goes along with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 So you can have all of the lessons wherever you go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 I'm going to have links to join the course and download the Pupford app below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=90.6s	90.6	 I'm really anxious to show you guys how Inersha has been doing around other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 But I also want to check in on some of the other skills that she's been working on too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 You might recall we've been working on sit pretty lately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=101.4s	101.4	 And I want to show you where she is on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=103.1s	103.1	 We've really been focusing on getting her to hold the position for a lot longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=107.3s	107.3	 And sit pretty, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 OK, good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 So, you know, pretty solid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=115.9s	115.9	 She's able to hold the position there for a few seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=118.8s	118.8	 I'm really proud of that one. That's a money trick right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 She's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 Let's check out how her form is doing on crawl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 You might remember we ran into a stumbling block with crawl because when she would do it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=128.6s	128.6	 she was dragging her hips and only moving her front feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 So I really want her using all four legs when she crawls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 Crawl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 And I'm just having her go just a couple of inches at a time right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 Like, I'm not really pushing her on that because it's more important for her to have the right form
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=143.3s	143.3	 than it is for her to do some impressive long crawl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 It's really important when you start to see a trick or behavior go in the wrong direction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=150.8s	150.8	 that you stop and not try to push them through that and instead really focus on the right form
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 or whatever issue it is that you're working on with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 It's much better to take a step back and repair than it is to try and fix it later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=162.8s	162.8	 Look at that. Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=164.7s	164.7	 Oh, wow. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=166.9s	166.9	 So her crawl has dramatically improved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 It's also worth mentioning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=170.3s	170.3	 The reason we teach things like this are to keep our dog's brain stimulated, to keep them active.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 I mean, sit, stay, down and come only goes so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=177.9s	177.9	 And those things tend to get kind of monotonous and boring to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 So if you've got a bright dog, you want to continually teach them new little things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=184.8s	184.8	 Get creative with it. For example, let me show you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 I've got this chair right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=188.9s	188.9	 So you might recall she knows paws up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=190.8s	190.8	 I'm really focused on improving her balance as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=193.9s	193.9	 My goal here is to see if I can get all fours up on the chair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=196.4s	196.4	 OK, come on, get down and come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 Can you get up here? Almost. That's all right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=200.5s	200.5	 Let's try it from over here, maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=203.1s	203.1	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=204.1s	204.1	 Almost here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=205.5s	205.5	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=206.4s	206.4	 Yes. Good. There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=207.9s	207.9	 So just kind of coaxing her and getting her to brainstorm there was really beneficial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=213.5s	213.5	 So we're teaching her how to stand on the chair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=215.5s	215.5	 Let's see if we can move it around a little bit, make sure she's extra comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=219.4s	219.4	 Oh, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 OK, good job. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=224.6s	224.6	 This is all fine, but I think we can do better than this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 So here we have something a little bit taller and a little bit more narrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 I've also modified this stool a little bit with some grippy material
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=236.4s	236.4	 so that if we can get her to jump up here, she'll be a little bit more secure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 Inertia, can you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=242.2s	242.2	 Very good. Yes. So she went right up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=244.8s	244.8	 I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=245.6s	245.6	 She seems to be really comfortable putting her paws up on things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 This is going to be a lot more daunting to jump up on than the chair was because it's a smaller surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=253.6s	253.6	 Let's see if we can motivate her to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=255.7s	255.7	 Want to come up here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=256.5s	256.5	 Oh, whoa, what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=259.5s	259.5	 OK, I'd say she's getting the point up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 Now, one of the reasons I like to train a stall like this on a stool is because, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=266.8s	266.8	 I like to have her stand on my back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 Sometimes that's kind of shaky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=269.9s	269.9	 This is a really good way to help her work on balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 I mean, look at those toes and feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=273.7s	273.7	 Look how they're really holding position as I move the stool around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=277.4s	277.4	 Look at that. Shake, shake, shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=278.6s	278.6	 Stay. Good work. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 So, look, we can even go as far here as putting it on two legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 Look at that. And you can see,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 I mean, she's really having to think there and keep her balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=289.6s	289.6	 And I think this is just a really good miscellaneous skill for her to have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=292.8s	292.8	 You know, for pictures, maybe you want your dog to jump on something and pose when you're at the park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=296.8s	296.8	 You never know. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=299.2s	299.2	 Good job. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=300.4s	300.4	 You might recall one of Inersha's biggest struggles lately is paying attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=304.6s	304.6	 in the presence of other dogs while in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=307.3s	307.3	 So let's check on Inersha's progress and see how she's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=310.8s	310.8	 A few months ago, I took Inersha out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=313.4s	313.4	 I gave her an introduction to the perimeter of this dog park,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=316.4s	316.4	 and she found it pretty overwhelming at the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=318.9s	318.9	 So I thought we would do a checkup, see how she's doing around the dog park
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=322.1s	322.1	 and all of the other distractions that the world has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=324.7s	324.7	 So right now, I've got Inersha positioned around some birds over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=328.4s	328.4	 We've got the dog park over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=329.9s	329.9	 There's steady flow of traffic and people and stuff walking by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=333.5s	333.5	 So I'm trying to reduce the use of treats for training sessions like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=337.3s	337.3	 I'm not asking a lot of her other than just basic, calm, everyday behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=341.4s	341.4	 I think a better reinforcer is probably just, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=344.2s	344.2	 general access to the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=345.8s	345.8	 Dogs really enjoy sniffing around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=348.2s	348.2	 They enjoy being outdoors, checking things out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=351.0s	351.0	 So being able to keep the experience moving and check out new things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=354.4s	354.4	 is often motivating enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=355.8s	355.8	 We've been here less than five minutes, and Inersha is already able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=358.7s	358.7	 to look at other people and dogs while staying calmly with a loose leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=362.1s	362.1	 This is a dramatic difference in how she would have acted in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=365.2s	365.2	 So rather than going right up to the dog park, I've been walking across the street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=369.2s	369.2	 I've been, you know, walking maybe 20, sometimes 30 minutes with her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=372.4s	372.4	 and then I'll just gradually give her more exposure to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=374.9s	374.9	 And the reason I'm doing this is that I want to keep her from stressing out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=379.4s	379.4	 or reacting when she sees the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=381.3s	381.3	 So I'm just going to kind of approach the dog park with caution right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=384.6s	384.6	 I'm not going to run right up to it because right now she's being great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=387.1s	387.1	 And I just want her to normalize this, which is another reason I'm not using treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=391.4s	391.4	 I want her to just take it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=392.8s	392.8	 I'm going to let her do a sit stay now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=394.5s	394.5	 If she checks out other dogs that are walking past us on this path over here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 there are distractions from all sides right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=401.0s	401.0	 You know, this is obviously something she's been prepared for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=403.2s	403.2	 We've worked up to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=404.4s	404.4	 So now that we've been up here for a little bit, I'm going to see if I can get her attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=407.6s	407.6	 on me voluntarily and escort her back to the path over here just to get her accustomed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=412.2s	412.2	 to seeing exciting dogs and then paying attention to me and moving on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=416.7s	416.7	 Look at me. OK, let's go. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=419.6s	419.6	 So we have another screensaver over here that we've moved closer to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=422.9s	422.9	 which has its healthy share of pedestrians and getting her to feel calm and relaxed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=426.9s	426.9	 around people and dogs and everything else is so important to me right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=430.5s	430.5	 So if she's feeling up for it, I'd like to see if I can get her walking around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=434.1s	434.1	 the perimeter of the dog park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=435.2s	435.2	 So in other words, getting her to pay attention to me and not fixate on the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 It's a double edged sword because it's a wonderful place to train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=442.4s	442.4	 and give your dog lots of distractions in order to prove a lot of their behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=446.4s	446.4	 But it's also a pretty hard environment to train in, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=449.2s	449.2	 But I just keep telling myself that if she can do really well out here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=452.8s	452.8	 then she can probably do really well in just about any park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=455.4s	455.4	 And so this is an exercise that's been really valuable for inertia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=458.9s	458.9	 being able to walk outside the perimeter of a dog park right up on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=462.6s	462.6	 Dogs come by, they notice her. She's at close range with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=465.6s	465.6	 You're going to stay right there, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=468.8s	468.8	 Good girl. OK, come on. It's cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=472.6s	472.6	 And so there are times when there is some minor tension on the leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=475.6s	475.6	 where I'm encouraging her to keep moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=477.5s	477.5	 But keep in mind, I do this very sparingly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=480.4s	480.4	 To me, it's the equivalent of taking a toddler by the hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=483.2s	483.2	 and encouraging them to stay with you at a shopping mall, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=486.0s	486.0	 But if it were ever perceived as something painful or intimidating to your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=490.1s	490.1	 you would want to avoid doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=492.6s	492.6	 Stay. Good girl. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=496.0s	496.0	 All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=498.3s	498.3	 So you're starting to see a theme here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=500.0s	500.0	 It's totally acceptable for inertia to notice things that arouse her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=504.6s	504.6	 Teaching her how to conduct herself is my main priority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=507.4s	507.4	 And she's really doing well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 Of course, she's not perfect yet, but I don't know that any dog ever is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=512.7s	512.7	 OK, now that inertia has adjusted to this crazy environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=515.7s	515.7	 let's see if she can do any of her other tricks here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=517.8s	517.8	 Remember, it takes practice to get your dog to be able to perform in a place like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=522.0s	522.0	 It's much more challenging than doing the same stuff in your living room, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=526.3s	526.3	 Look at me. Can you switch?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=529.1s	529.1	 Good job. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=530.6s	530.6	 So her switch is coming along nicely, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=532.5s	532.5	 I'm able to get it with a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=534.0s	534.0	 Can you lie down and play dead?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=538.0s	538.0	 I'll take that. That was a good one. Come alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=540.8s	540.8	 Look at me. Can you sit? Sit pretty?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=544.4s	544.4	 Yeah. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=546.9s	546.9	 Lie down. Lie down is a really good way for me to kind of encourage her to really stay still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=552.3s	552.3	 This is what you want. You get dogs speeding past and she's accustomed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=555.9s	555.9	 to holding her position and not lunging and barking, saying, I want to play, I want to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=560.5s	560.5	 All right. So it's been a minute since we've done the somersault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=562.9s	562.9	 I don't know that she's ever done a somersault outdoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=566.1s	566.1	 What's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=567.9s	567.9	 What? What is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=570.6s	570.6	 That's not a somersault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=572.4s	572.4	 I think she got like heel and a somersault confused there and tried to do them both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=576.1s	576.1	 Wait, what's this? Where you go?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=578.7s	578.7	 What's that? There we go. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=581.6s	581.6	 These are tricks that we started training inside and then in the neighborhood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=585.8s	585.8	 and then at the local park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=587.2s	587.2	 And now we're doing them right next to a bunch of dogs at a dog park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=590.4s	590.4	 So getting your dog to do a lot of the skills that they know in a variety of places is really what makes it so fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=596.2s	596.2	 Is really what makes a dog trained, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=599.3s	599.3	 OK, there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=601.0s	601.0	 Good job, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=602.3s	602.3	 This is why I like doing flashcards, because, OK, pause up on something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=605.8s	605.8	 The only thing I see around here really is this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=609.0s	609.0	 So I wonder if I can get her to just kind of put her paws up on this frisbee golf thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=614.1s	614.1	 Paws up. Yes, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=616.3s	616.3	 Now, that's fascinating. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=619.2s	619.2	 Look at me. OK, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=622.3s	622.3	 That was great. I mean, that excites me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=623.8s	623.8	 I know it might not look like much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=625.1s	625.1	 That was her first attempt at this and she just didn't hesitate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=628.3s	628.3	 So she's starting to generalize, putting her paws up on things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=631.7s	631.7	 So to a dog trainer, that's exciting stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=633.6s	633.6	 All in all, very successful day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=635.2s	635.2	 I mean, doing exercises like this and getting your dog out into the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=639.0s	639.0	 and practicing around things that challenge them is really essential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=643.4s	643.4	 But finding ways to do it in small doses over time and working your way up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=647.8s	647.8	 That's really the key, I think, to lessons like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=650.7s	650.7	 OK, let's up the difficulty now and take her to a park where there are even more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=654.5s	654.5	 distractions and there is an offense between her and the other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=658.1s	658.1	 Upon our arrival, there just happened to be a herd of horses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=661.6s	661.6	 She's shown great improvement in listening to me around giant mammals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=665.2s	665.2	 but I'm still not confident that she'll tune them out completely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=668.2s	668.2	 So it's on us to introduce those things to our dogs in a safe way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=671.6s	671.6	 that allows them to take it in and then train them how to behave over time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=674.8s	674.8	 around those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=676.0s	676.0	 Can you look at me? Let's go this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=678.4s	678.4	 So in this case, I'm happy that I can ultimately get her attention on me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=681.4s	681.4	 voluntarily and get her to walk away from the horses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=684.1s	684.1	 When we were in the French Quarter that time and she was barking at those mules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=687.6s	687.6	 This is definitely an improvement from that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=689.6s	689.6	 Practicing around distractions requires you to consistently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=692.9s	692.9	 get your dog's attention on you, even in short bursts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=696.3s	696.3	 In other words, you'll have to get them to walk back and forth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=698.6s	698.6	 a few feet like this while paying attention to you before you can expect them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=702.5s	702.5	 to give you sustained attention on a long, proper walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=705.9s	705.9	 OK, here comes a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=707.0s	707.0	 Let me practice on getting her attention on me in the presence of this dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=710.6s	710.6	 Stay and notice how we're off the walking path here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=713.5s	713.5	 in order to make it easier for inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=715.7s	715.7	 My goal is to prevent an outburst towards another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=718.9s	718.9	 And practicing farther away like this makes success more likely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=723.3s	723.3	 Switch. That's right. That's right. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=727.3s	727.3	 It's really important for her to get used to saxophone living in New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=731.0s	731.0	 I think she likes it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=732.6s	732.6	 The horses are back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=733.8s	733.8	 We're at a greater distance than we were last time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=736.6s	736.6	 Once again, protocol here, I'm just going to let her check them out at a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=739.7s	739.7	 If she's reacting like this well, then I'm going to get her attention on me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=743.0s	743.0	 and ask her to do something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=744.8s	744.8	 Look at me just to prove the fact that I can get her listening to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=748.3s	748.3	 when she's distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=749.6s	749.6	 Let me see if I can get enough focus out of inertia to do a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=752.6s	752.6	 of frisbee training with me in this brand new place with heavy distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=757.2s	757.2	 Go. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=763.3s	763.3	 Inertia. At first, inertia gets a little distracted here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=767.7s	767.7	 but I'm going to try to keep her engaged with this game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=771.4s	771.4	 Good girl. Yes, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=775.4s	775.4	 There you go. That's the one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=777.8s	777.8	 Stay skateboard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=780.1s	780.1	 When I'm in public places like this, I'm always looking out for intense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=783.1s	783.1	 distractions, which is why I'm using this long lead as a safety net. Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=790.9s	790.9	 Inertia, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=795.4s	795.4	 Hey, come here. Weave, weave, weave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=799.4s	799.4	 Good. Stay stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=801.4s	801.4	 Stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=809.6s	809.6	 I'm thrilled with this frisbee session in a distracting park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=812.9s	812.9	 In the next episode, I'll teach inertia about boundaries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RWTNBAoO40&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=815.9s	815.9	 so that she can start to learn where she can and can't go.
