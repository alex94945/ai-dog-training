https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 Chloe's a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 She still developed a counter surfing issue that we're going to go try and help them with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 Counter surfing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 That's where they jump up on the counter and eat food when you're not looking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 I'm just answering questions on Facebook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 And I'll tell you something.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 Like 80% of the questions on Facebook can be answered by simply controlling our dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 environment and our surroundings and then take the time to teach them in that environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 At least to deal with most problems like unwanted behaviors and...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 Which are most of the questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 I hope so, if the weather's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 When you're getting helicopter shots, you have to make sure the weather is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 It is 11 o'clock.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 filming for TV and filming for YouTube like we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Kind of apples and oranges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 It's much more gratifying to me to do YouTube videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 You know, I've had two national TV shows in two countries now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 And I really enjoy doing television a lot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 to as many people as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 There are a lot of things you can do to make a video more awesome and there are a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 things you can do to be awesome working with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 And I think that you have a really unique perspective of being able to combine those two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 My favorite people when working on a TV show are the crew, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 I really enjoy talking and learning from the sound guys, the directors, photography,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 And I always took the opportunity to learn from them wherever I could over the years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 I think it's important to know how to do every job in a particular field if that's what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 going to want to get good at.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 behaviors and stuff like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 See, we have at least one, two, three, four, five puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 Oh, boy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 So dogs are one of the only animals in the world that will look to a human being in the eye for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyflH0UE4w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=594&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 guidance and direction.
