https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Alpha Centauri, my dog, he's chilling with us today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=2.9s	2.9	 I'm dedicating some time to answering some Patreon questions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 and I just came across a really good one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=7.1s	7.1	 It's a good example of a tough question,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=10.2s	10.2	 and I thought it would be really helpful to a lot of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 Your feet are so big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 This is Clarissa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=16.2s	16.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 She says, I'm a new Patreon member.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=19.5s	19.5	 This is my monthly question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=20.8s	20.8	 I got a rescue dog a month ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=22.5s	22.5	 My dog is resource guarding me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=24.8s	24.8	 Call it guarding behavior, call it jealousy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=27.1s	27.1	 call it whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=28.3s	28.3	 She sometimes gets really aggressive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=30.1s	30.1	 if people or dogs approach,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=31.6s	31.6	 and she goes nuts if I interact with other people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=34.3s	34.3	 or dogs for too long, or, and this is why I'm writing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=38.4s	38.4	 if I get within five feet of my roommate's dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=41.2s	41.2	 If I leave the house, the two seem to avoid each other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=43.6s	43.6	 or otherwise manage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=45.2s	45.2	 The house is safe, and the dogs are in one piece
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 when I get home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=48.4s	48.4	 But when I get through the front door, they go crazy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 and when they go crazy near the door,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 my dog starts to attack my roommate's dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=55.4s	55.4	 and they won't stop until I physically drag my dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 to another room and close the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=59.5s	59.5	 I'm at my wit's end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=60.7s	60.7	 She can't keep attacking my roommate's dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 It's becoming a daily thing where they fight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 with no blood drawn yet, thankfully, and fight and fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 My roommate's dog is afraid all the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=70.6s	70.6	 and tries to hide in corners, but my dog won't let up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 Yelling at her mid-fight in a loud, deep voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=75.8s	75.8	 will make her run to me and look really sorry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=78.4s	78.4	 but I really, really, really don't like doing that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=81.4s	81.4	 and after about five seconds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 my dog will be ready to fight again unless I distract her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=85.7s	85.7	 and manage to bring the energy way down quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 I feel awful when I yell,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=90.2s	90.2	 but I can't have her hurting other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 It's the only way I've found to break them apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 Affirm, ah, when it looks like she's going in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=97.4s	97.4	 for a squabble works sometimes, but not always.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 I've tried praising her for staying calm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 when the other dog is potentially visible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=104.5s	104.5	 but thus far, this does not appear to have any effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 The opportunity to praise her is also a slim, slim window.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 That's why praise and petting a dog as a reward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 or as a currency isn't usually as effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 It's not a good enough reward for a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=119.8s	119.8	 It's important to have the proper perspective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=121.7s	121.7	 on something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=122.5s	122.5	 It can take a lot of time to resolve these issues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=125.7s	125.7	 so you need to keep your expectations realistic there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=128.1s	128.1	 but there are some encouraging things here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 that I'll talk about in a moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 but number one, you have to take a step back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=133.7s	133.7	 on your training, and you need to do that primarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 in one huge way, which is by regaining control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=139.6s	139.6	 of the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=140.7s	140.7	 So your new dog hasn't yet earned the right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=144.3s	144.3	 to have access to the other dog and to the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=147.7s	147.7	 They need to be very reliable on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 before you can expect your dog to be reliable off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 This is gonna take a lot of work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=153.8s	153.8	 There's a lot of management that you're going to have to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=156.2s	156.2	 so I'd recommend that you have your dog attached to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 when you are in a position to directly supervise your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=161.5s	161.5	 because number one, we have to prevent the outburst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 from occurring, and that's how we do that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=165.7s	165.7	 by controlling the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 It requires significant effort sometimes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 when you have another dog, but I like that you have a crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 so if you have a crate in the main area, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=175.4s	175.4	 you can put your dog in the crate for short periods of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=178.2s	178.2	 when you're not in a position to really focus on training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=181.5s	181.5	 Perhaps secure a bedroom or a bathroom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=183.4s	183.4	 where you can easily keep them separate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 when you're not in a position to really focus on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=187.5s	187.5	 That's number one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=188.4s	188.4	 Take a step back, control the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 Next, you need to focus on doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=192.4s	192.4	 some counter conditioning exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=194.7s	194.7	 Now this is really simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=196.3s	196.3	 You want to start to create positive associations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=199.7s	199.7	 around the other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=202.7s	202.7	 For example, when he's behaving well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=204.4s	204.4	 in the presence of the other dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=205.8s	205.8	 simple praise probably isn't good enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=208.1s	208.1	 You need to have tiny bits of chicken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 so you can just reward two and three times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 wait a second, you're being a good dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=215.6s	215.6	 Look at me, yes, stay good, oh, you're doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 Really interacting with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=223.2s	223.2	 in the presence of your other dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=224.9s	224.9	 and creating that real pleasurable association
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=227.2s	227.2	 with being around the other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=228.8s	228.8	 One or two sessions of this, not gonna work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=231.5s	231.5	 You have to really focus on doing this over the next,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 I'd say weeks to months, could even be longer in some cases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=237.5s	237.5	 depending how severe it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 But I don't think your case is that severe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=240.7s	240.7	 because what's really encouraging to me Clarissa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=243.9s	243.9	 is you said once they start fighting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=245.4s	245.4	 you can interrupt with a verbal correction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=247.8s	247.8	 and your dog will come back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 And I like that you don't like doing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 because you're right, once it gets to that point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=253.4s	253.4	 it's really too late to have any meaningful training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=255.9s	255.9	 Our goal is to prevent the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=257.5s	257.5	 from arising in the first place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=258.8s	258.8	 since we know the triggers, you identified them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=262.1s	262.1	 You have a pretty good idea of when your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=263.5s	263.5	 is likely to act out unfavorably in this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=266.6s	266.6	 The fact that you're able to get verbal control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=268.8s	268.8	 of your dog once they're in a fight says that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=271.5s	271.5	 it's the level of the squabble probably isn't too intense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=276.1s	276.1	 The other example you mentioned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=277.3s	277.3	 when they're both at the door and then they tend to go at it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=279.6s	279.6	 really does sound kind of like amygdala hijack,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 you know, and when that's where a dog is in a state of mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=285.2s	285.2	 where they're just in a rage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 and they're not gonna listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=288.5s	288.5	 This happens with people too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=289.6s	289.6	 if you've ever lost your temper before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=291.5s	291.5	 or if you've ever seen someone with road rage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=293.4s	293.4	 you can probably bet that they're not really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=294.9s	294.9	 in a good state of mind to be communicated with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=297.1s	297.1	 at that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 You sound extremely dedicated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=299.7s	299.7	 and you just have to put in the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=300.9s	300.9	 and do the right things with your time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=302.6s	302.6	 And of course, exercise early in the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=305.3s	305.3	 is likely to make this training go much easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=307.9s	307.9	 as when dogs get that energy out there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=310.5s	310.5	 so much better behaved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=That4EH3sMM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=442&pp=iAQB&t=312.2s	312.2	 Excellent question, thank you, Kodasa.
