https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=3.9s	3.9	 And this is our dog, Indy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 Rule number one of training, always use amazing treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 Average treats won't cut it if you're at all serious about training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=12.3s	12.3	 That's why you want major attention getters like these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 Pupford has two incredible treats to choose from, which are way different than anything

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=20.1s	20.1	 When dogs eat better, they feel better and act better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=23.1s	23.1	 These new freeze-dried sweet potato treats literally have one ingredient in them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 They're ultra healthy and they'll get your dog listening to you quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=30.2s	30.2	 They're made from 100% sweet potatoes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=32.7s	32.7	 These are perfect to keep your dog's protein consumption down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 Plus everyone knows sweet potatoes are a super food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 I've been using these freeze-dried beef liver treats, also from Pupford, for the last many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=41.9s	41.9	 months and every single dog I've offered these to has just loved them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=45.5s	45.5	 They're freeze-dried, which means they get rid of all the moisture, but the nutrients
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 and the flavor remains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 Try mixing both kinds of treats into your treat bag because keeping your rewards extra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=54.2s	54.2	 random and using a variety makes training more exciting and multi-dimensional for your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=59.5s	59.5	 Having the best treats available at your fingertips will put you in a better position to establish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 phenomenal communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=65.4s	65.4	 Pupford treats are great for dogs of all ages and you can get them now at the link in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=69.5s	69.5	 description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=70.5s	70.5	 And when you subscribe for auto shipments, you'll get an additional discount and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 can lock in that price for all of your future shipments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=76.4s	76.4	 Click thumbs up for Orion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 He's back for part two of our training lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 In our last lesson, we worked on fetch and getting them to pay attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=83.4s	83.4	 So now I'd like to focus on giving him some basic skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 Remember, he is a homeless dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=87.6s	87.6	 He's looking for a home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 And one of the issues with so many dogs in shelters and rescue groups is that they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 walk well on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=94.4s	94.4	 They pull, they jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=95.7s	95.7	 So getting a dog to have those basic manners makes them way more adoptable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 And that's my goal with Orion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 We want to see if we can find him a new loving home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=103.5s	103.5	 But first we got to get him trained a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 Leash walking is an essential skill for a dog to have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=108.7s	108.7	 I mean, if they're going to be living in a normal environment like this, they've got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=111.9s	111.9	 to be able to walk nicely on leash without jumping and pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 Our first order of business before doing a proper leash training session with an energetic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 dog like Orion is to get all of that energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=121.1s	121.1	 In our last lesson, we did an introductory fetch session with Orion, and I think he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 got enormous potential to be a frisbee dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=127.1s	127.1	 So I'd like to see how he does on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=128.8s	128.8	 First thing we're going to do is put a lead on him so we have complete control of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=132.4s	132.4	 Oh, wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 I love this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 Look how he's immediately getting into the frisbee by playing tug with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=137.2s	137.2	 That's usually half the battle because it's a hard substance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 Like a rope toy is something that dogs prefer to play tug with as a general rule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=143.9s	143.9	 But if you can get a dog playing tug with a frisbee this quickly, that's a good sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 We worked on let go last time a little bit, so he's still a little rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=150.4s	150.4	 Now when he lets go, I'm going to roll it like that to encourage him to chase it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=154.5s	154.5	 Look at him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 He picked up the frisbee and brought it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=156.8s	156.8	 Oh man, that's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 Look how he's trying to play keep away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=159.3s	159.3	 This is why you have your dog on lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 I'm going to let him know by letting go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 He'll get what he wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 And the reason I'm rolling it like that is to encourage him to go for the rim.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 See how he's losing interest periodically in the frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=171.1s	171.1	 I'm going to reignite his interest by playing tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=174.4s	174.4	 And you see just by doing that, he got a lot more interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 I'll tell you what.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=177.2s	177.2	 Let's see what happens if we throw it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=178.3s	178.3	 I'm just going to hover it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=179.7s	179.7	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 What is happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=181.7s	181.7	 First attempt, he caught it out of the air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=183.5s	183.5	 I'm speechless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=184.6s	184.6	 You never see that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 I need to reward him by playing some tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=187.2s	187.2	 It was incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 See if it happens again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=189.2s	189.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=190.2s	190.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 For a first frisbee lesson, that was pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 He caught it out of the air when I hovered it in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 He's chasing rollers, grabbing them by the rim, playing lots of vigorous tug with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=199.3s	199.3	 That's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=200.3s	200.3	 We don't have a top notch frisbee dog just yet that's going to take more training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=203.6s	203.6	 We got that energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=204.8s	204.8	 So that puts us in an ideal position now to do a leash training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 My last lesson with Orion, we worked on look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=210.9s	210.9	 Let's see how he's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=211.9s	211.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=213.9s	213.9	 Getting your dog to look at you when you ask will be an essential part of teaching them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=216.6s	216.6	 to walk on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 We've got a giant lawnmower going on over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=220.3s	220.3	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=221.3s	221.3	 He's acknowledging it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=222.3s	222.3	 I actually like how he's behaving right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 So I'd rather him not react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=224.8s	224.8	 I'm going to go ahead and see if he'll take a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=227.1s	227.1	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=228.7s	228.7	 He's got a teachable mindset if he'll accept a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=230.7s	230.7	 Sometimes when dogs are really distracted, they won't accept a treat at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 Little more reaction there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=234.8s	234.8	 Little tension on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=236.2s	236.2	 Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=237.2s	237.2	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=238.2s	238.2	 Yeah, that was a good one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 I was able to get his eyes on me in the face of that somewhat significant distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=243.5s	243.5	 Not every day you see that, huh, Orion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=245.4s	245.4	 So I can get him to look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 Now let's see if I can get him to look at me while moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 It might be easy to assume that just because your dog will look at you right here that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=252.5s	252.5	 they'll do it while walking on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 Not necessarily the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=256.1s	256.1	 Anytime you change a variable, you have to be prepared to really methodically work with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=260.4s	260.4	 your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=261.4s	261.4	 In other words, this is a completely new skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=263.1s	263.1	 So getting your dog to look at you while walking is the trick here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=266.2s	266.2	 So now I'm going to go back this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=267.6s	267.6	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 Nope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 See, don't have eyes on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=270.6s	270.6	 So I'm going to stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=271.6s	271.6	 Hey, Orion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 Right there was a perfect example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 I got his eyes on me while he was in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=276.8s	276.8	 Notice I kind of have to hunch down a little bit to really get on his level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=280.4s	280.4	 You might notice this is looking pretty easy right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=282.8s	282.8	 And it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=283.8s	283.8	 The reason is, is that we've put in the prerequisite work here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=286.4s	286.4	 We've exercised him and we've taught him how to do a basic look at me when we hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 the treat up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 So we're in good shape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 Hey, look who's back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=293.0s	293.0	 The lawnmower guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 Only now he's even closer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 So I like to see if I can get a look at me in the face of any distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=298.2s	298.2	 Right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=299.2s	299.2	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=300.2s	300.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=302.2s	302.2	 Oh, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 See, he's much closer now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=304.2s	304.2	 But did you see how when that lawnmower got really close to us, he wouldn't take the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=308.4s	308.4	 at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=309.4s	309.4	 And then as the lawnmower retreated, he was like, okay, I'll pay attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=312.4s	312.4	 That illustrates the point that closer your dog is to a distraction, the less likely they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=316.6s	316.6	 are to listen to you in the face of that distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=318.8s	318.8	 So remember, when you're in those situations, especially with a dog new to training and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=322.1s	322.1	 you can't get their attention, protocol is to create distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=325.2s	325.2	 Get away from that distraction if possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 In this case, the lawnmower got away from us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=328.8s	328.8	 By training in public like this, you just never know what distractions you're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=331.8s	331.8	 to get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=332.8s	332.8	 So let's resume our lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=333.8s	333.8	 So come on over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=334.8s	334.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 I'm going to let him walk and I'm going to turn around this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=338.2s	338.2	 I'm going to keep him off to one side like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=340.4s	340.4	 I prefer my left in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=342.3s	342.3	 Look how calmly he's walking right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=344.5s	344.5	 That tongue is hanging out of his mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=346.1s	346.1	 He's panting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=347.1s	347.1	 That's a good thing in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=348.3s	348.3	 That's why we exercise them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=349.6s	349.6	 It's a lot easier for him to focus when you get their energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=352.5s	352.5	 And the reason we walk back and forth like this on a preliminary leash training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=356.7s	356.7	 is because this is familiar territory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=358.8s	358.8	 So he's like, all right, I've seen this territory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=360.6s	360.6	 I'm a lot more likely to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=362.2s	362.2	 We want to teach the fundamentals very methodically and slowly, just like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=366.5s	366.5	 And do you see how we're able to teach this without force and we're able to get him to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=370.4s	370.4	 think rather than making him walk slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=372.7s	372.7	 We're teaching him how to walk slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=374.7s	374.7	 This is why you want to avoid using gimmicky collars like choke chains, electric collars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=378.3s	378.3	 or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=379.3s	379.3	 You want to teach your dog how to think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=380.5s	380.5	 And I'm being quite liberal with my rewards at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 He's never had a leash training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=384.6s	384.6	 So this is his very first one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=386.1s	386.1	 The shelter workers were telling me about this, that he tends to get really distracted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=389.5s	389.5	 by ground sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=390.5s	390.5	 Remember, dogs really take in the world so differently than we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=394.0s	394.0	 So it's important to work with them and understand how distracting that really is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=397.4s	397.4	 That was an example of redirecting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=399.2s	399.2	 That's how we redirect a dog when they're distracted by something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=402.1s	402.1	 In this case, a ground scent on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=404.2s	404.2	 Did you catch how I didn't reward one time, but I rewarded the other?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=407.3s	407.3	 He's behaving so reliably in this specific context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=410.4s	410.4	 So I'm going to kind of vary the rate at which I reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=413.2s	413.2	 In this case, I can lower the rate at which I reward because he's proving that he's performing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=417.7s	417.7	 very reliable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=418.7s	418.7	 Now, if a dog walks by, I'm going to up that rate of reinforcement or if the lawnmower
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=422.9s	422.9	 comes back again, then I'm really going to be sure to reward super liberally in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=426.7s	426.7	 case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=427.7s	427.7	 So that's what I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=428.7s	428.7	 You're going to get a rate of reinforcement when you're training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=430.7s	430.7	 Again, look at that loose leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4hCAeKfaU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=340&pp=iAQB&t=432.1s	432.1	 He's doing really good.
