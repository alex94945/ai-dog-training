https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=12.1s	12.1	 But how do you get your dog to listen to you in real life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=14.5s	14.5	 when you're distracted by everyday things like cleaning the house,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=37.5s	37.5	 If I were to put a plate of food in front of Flurry, he would scramble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 I do give him treats during the day, and he is absolutely obnoxious.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=52.9s	52.9	 when I can't completely focus on him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=55.2s	55.2	 When you're teaching your dog something brand new,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 But just because you've taught your dog something like Leave It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 when you're focused on them doesn't mean that they'll do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 when your attention is divided.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 My hope is today we're going to make some progress on that with Flurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=69.5s	69.5	 Wherever possible, include your dog with you in day-to-day activities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 and have them tied to you with a leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=74.9s	74.9	 especially during that first year of training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 so that you can more easily get to them to show them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=82.2s	82.2	 This should be interesting for a variety of reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=85.2s	85.2	 We're going to see if we can get Flurry to listen to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 while I attempt to cook this meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 I'm actually a new customer of Blue Apron.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 Flurry, you can't have my Blue Apron meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=99.5s	99.5	 Don't worry, though.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 Looks like garlic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=121.1s	121.1	 Some good chicken.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 In the past, when I would go to find things like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 I would have a really hard time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=156.8s	156.8	 Yakaniku sauce?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=163.3s	163.3	 So I love that about Blue Apron, that they have exactly what you need

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 Clearly, Flurry is not understanding that I don't want him to keep jumping on the counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=172.7s	172.7	 here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=176.3s	176.3	 let me lure him off the counter like this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=191.4s	191.4	 We can do this, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=192.7s	192.7	 It looks like the first step is to prepare the ingredients.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=205.9s	205.9	 I don't need any help.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=246.1s	246.1	 Now it is time to cook and glaze the chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=248.9s	248.9	 Maybe a little more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 It's so great because you know exactly what's going into your food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=254.7s	254.7	 And dare I say it, I'm actually learning how to cook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 And that is awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=259.6s	259.6	 That's what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=260.4s	260.4	 The only way your dog is going to learn how to naturally settle down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=263.8s	263.8	 in day-to-day situations like this is if you give them the opportunity to do it naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=268.9s	268.9	 The more your dog is used to something happening,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=271.2s	271.2	 like you cooking dinner, talking on the phone, or having guests over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 the more likely it is that they'll behave as you want them to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=277.5s	277.5	 because it's not such a special occasion to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=279.8s	279.8	 Let's work on some real life leave it training with Flurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=282.6s	282.6	 I mean, sometimes when you're cooking, you might drop food on the floor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=285.7s	285.7	 but that doesn't mean it's a free for all for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=288.2s	288.2	 I've already worked with Flurry on a basic leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=290.2s	290.2	 So let's see what happens if I drop this piece of chicken right in front of him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 and tell him to leave it when I'm not really paying so much attention to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=297.8s	297.8	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=300.5s	300.5	 Okay, not so good, because he's not used to me dropping chicken in front of him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=304.9s	304.9	 or experiencing it in a non-training setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 This is why you have to go out of your way to really work with your dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=310.9s	310.9	 organically in natural day-to-day situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=313.5s	313.5	 I'm going to take a step back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=314.7s	314.7	 I'm going to get down on the ground like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=316.6s	316.6	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=318.2s	318.2	 Hey, not bad. That was a good step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 I'm trying to work up to being able to just throw treats in front of them while I cook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=329.4s	329.4	 That was great. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=331.8s	331.8	 And leave this carrot alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=335.0s	335.0	 Yeah, nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=336.5s	336.5	 Good job. You can have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=337.9s	337.9	 Now I think we're at the point where if I drop it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=340.4s	340.4	 he'll probably leave it alone if I tell him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=342.6s	342.6	 Good. Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=344.0s	344.0	 Yeah, that was a good one, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=345.8s	345.8	 You're not going to get as far in your training as really just going out of your way to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=349.1s	349.1	 yes, I like that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=351.3s	351.3	 I like that you're being calm. I like that you're being good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=354.1s	354.1	 That's what gets you rapid results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=356.2s	356.2	 It's not as intuitive to a lot of people, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=357.8s	357.8	 I can understand why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=358.9s	358.9	 You think, well, how do I keep my dog from doing something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 by acknowledging the things you like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=363.5s	363.5	 That's how.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=364.2s	364.2	 If you could smell it in here, you would know that's majorly distracting for a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=368.5s	368.5	 And you've got to do this now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=370.1s	370.1	 You've got to be able to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=371.3s	371.3	 It's majorly distracting for a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=372.9s	372.9	 And you've got to do this not just one time, not just twice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=375.6s	375.6	 but make your dog part of your life as much as possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=378.9s	378.9	 so that you can really teach them effectively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=381.8s	381.8	 It is time to cook the bok choy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=383.7s	383.7	 We're going to use some of the extra marinade from the carrots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=386.7s	386.7	 I would never know to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=388.1s	388.1	 Signing up for Blue Apron only took me two minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=390.2s	390.2	 Just choose your diet preferences and whether you want the two person or the family plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=393.8s	393.8	 The first 50 viewers to sign up using the link in the description will get three free meals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=398.1s	398.1	 And remember, there's no commitment and you can skip or cancel at any time for any reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=403.2s	403.2	 Shipping is always free and Blue Apron ships to most of the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 This looks a lot like the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=409.3s	409.3	 Let's see if our training has stuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=411.7s	411.7	 And let me see if I can get Flurry to leave this whole plate alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=415.7s	415.7	 when I put it in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=417.5s	417.5	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=418.4s	418.4	 That's pretty amazing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5LMKpYXuK0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=421.1s	421.1	 Make sure you subscribe to my channel.
