https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=232.5s	232.5	 Yeah, well, it's easier to work with okay, so back on dog training though. Oh, no actually okay, so your dog start dog star
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=239.3s	239.3	 Oh my god. What's it's a dog start daily comm that's it dog start daily comm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 That's your that's your main website
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 What your only website really it's very successful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 We have a number of websites, but this is the one we care about Kelly and Jamie and myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 Yeah, it's like a little family affair and what what is the average person that goes there like what are they who is drawn to that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=259.2s	259.2	 Website I have a couple of types of people you know dog trainer and dog owner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 And I guess where we are a little unique we get a lot of people who come back over and over again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=270.7s	270.7	 You know unlike some websites that will get loads and loads of you know users
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=275.1s	275.1	 And they're all between 12 and 13
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=277.3s	277.3	 We get people who find it and they keep coming back because the website is very deep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=281.4s	281.4	 There's a lot of video a lot of audio a lot of written material then it's all free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=285.7s	285.7	 Yeah, and that's the way to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=287.2s	287.2	 I think really so make information should be free that doesn't mean you can't make money doing other things and then find way to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 That that's kind of the the way I've looked at it too. I mean the crazy thing is you know we give away these two books for free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=299.9s	299.9	 But now a book sales have gone up right those two books
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=304.7s	304.7	 That's interesting it is it I mean I think it's one of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=307.2s	307.2	 But I think it's because of the extra exposure because we give them away for free we get more people come and look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=312.9s	312.9	 So proportionally we get more people that are buying even though that they could just download them for free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=318.3s	318.3	 Yeah, and you know I think and I haven't I haven't asked him about this yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=322.9s	322.9	 I'm gonna ask him about it because I've always told you guys that I think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=328.4s	328.4	 That dog training is most over complicated thing in the culture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=331.6s	331.6	 Today and that it's really quite easy if you just take the time to connect and understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=337.3s	337.3	 Your dog, but would you say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=339.9s	339.9	 That there is a lack of emphasis on the relationship aspect of dog training with our dogs today in this country as it relates to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=348.1s	348.1	 Mainstream dog training. Oh, yeah, and the way it's going. I mean I think so many trainers now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 Are trying to emulate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=356.0s	356.0	 The learning theory that was created by computers training animals in cages
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=361.3s	361.3	 I would know options you know we're not computers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=364.5s	364.5	 We don't computers well, and we're not consistent, but the feedback that we give to animals now has become quantum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=371.3s	371.3	 I mean people are trying to talk to their animals in clicks and treats and buzzes and shocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=376.8s	376.8	 I like talking to a dog with my voice because I think it is much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=381.2s	381.2	 It's richer the feedback I can give is not just you get it right or you get it wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=386.1s	386.1	 But it's like how right you get it good dog good dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=388.9s	388.9	 There's a good dog or you can communicate how serious not complying is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=395.4s	395.4	 and so I'm really into getting people to use their voices only and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=400.3s	400.3	 To develop the relationship and to get a dog that is reliable off leash, so he has a better quality of life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=407.5s	407.5	 So it really is interesting how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=411.3s	411.3	 So many present-day trainers have become technicians and this like quantum language. You know the clicks in the shocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=419.3s	419.3	 It's not the way. I want to talk to a dog now having said that you know no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=424.3s	424.3	 I think something like clicker training has great uses in particular situations if you want to teach a dog something really precise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=431.5s	431.5	 but for pet dog training by and large I wouldn't use it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=435.5s	435.5	 Giving feedback with shocks I would never use a tool right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=440.7s	440.7	 Yeah, I mean really it's about making it. It's people very you'll you'll get this a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=445.1s	445.1	 How do I make my dog do X and it's not about making our dogs do anything?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=449.5s	449.5	 It's about making them want to do it and and you make them want to do it by increasing that relationship and quality of life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=454.9s	454.9	 That you're talking about I think well

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=462.1s	462.1	 And that's a very specific exercise which to me is 90% of training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=466.4s	466.4	 First we want to teach the dog what we want it to do because it doesn't speak English
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=469.8s	469.8	 It's no good saying to the dog you know late a child peasy peasy doesn't speak Swahili
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=475.5s	475.5	 But I'm still working on mine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=479.7s	479.7	 Lovely by the way gorgeous

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=489.8s	489.8	 Instructions, so they know what we want to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=492.1s	492.1	 But then the bonker training and to me the fun of training is to motivate the dog to want to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=498.3s	498.3	 This is where the relationship comes in, but I am specifically trying to motivate the dog so he wants to comply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=505.1s	505.1	 So when it gets to telling him on occasions very rarely you have to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=510.9s	510.9	 We don't really have a problem just by and large he wants to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=515.0s	515.0	 Right I think that's it's a huge

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=522.3s	522.3	 I state that many of my colleagues disagree with and it's okay if you do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=526.9s	526.9	 But I'm curious to get your thoughts on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=529.7s	529.7	 right I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=536.8s	536.8	 Understanding the English language in simple sentence form when one takes the time to teach it to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=541.7s	541.7	 Are dogs complex enough and capable enough to understand simple sentences. Oh, it's no question about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=546.9s	546.9	 I mean I one sentence I used to say to my Malamute Phoenix was Phoenix come here

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=575.8s	575.8	 When people ask me what is training I say well on the one hand you could say is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=580.7s	580.7	 Changing the frequency of behaviors and putting some of them on the queue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=584.6s	584.6	 But to do that the first stage if you like in training is teaching dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=589.1s	589.1	 ESL teaching dogs English as a second language or Spanish as a second language or jibdada

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=600.6s	600.6	 You know it's no good back to the example the Swahili example again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=603.9s	603.9	 It's no good saying late a child peasy peasy, and then you don't respond so I say late a child peasy peasy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=610.6s	610.6	 Which we do when someone doesn't understand we speak louder, and then with dogs we get frustrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=616.8s	616.8	 And we assume the dog should come with a installed software
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=622.0s	622.0	 Where he knows how to come sit lie down roll over you know fetch the paper read the paper wash the dishes or whatever

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=634.6s	634.6	 People are always looking for a magic answer in dog training. They're always looking for well. What is it that I should do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=639.3s	639.3	 What am I doing wrong? I mean really the answer is obviously time patience consistency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=643.0s	643.0	 I think of the you know among the three most important things that you have to be prepared to be you know and to put in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=649.3s	649.3	 That time and everything, but what is your general advice when you have ten seconds to advise someone on dog training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=654.8s	654.8	 I like the word magic. I think that the owner is coming to me, and they say right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=659.5s	659.5	 I want to train my dog. I want to do it really quickly. I'm with him right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=663.2s	663.2	 I'm a very lazy person, and so I'm always searching for what is the quickest easiest way to train the dog and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=670.5s	670.5	 The crazy out of control adolescent dog within minutes. I want to bring it in control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=675.9s	675.9	 So he's sitting and looking at the owner so the owner realizes wow look at the change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=680.6s	680.6	 I've had in behavior in this short time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=683.0s	683.0	 So I'm actually totally with owners when they say they want magic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=687.7s	687.7	 I have to tell them I cannot put my hand on your dog's head and would you he is trained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=693.1s	693.1	 I can't do that for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=694.8s	694.8	 But I can come up with techniques which take little effort and they're very very effective and they're quick and easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=702.1s	702.1	 So for me that is I mean I talked about the six ease and dog training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=706.1s	706.1	 You know dog training is going to be easy and efficient press the owner won't do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=709.4s	709.4	 It's going to be effective for us a waste of time. It's going to be enjoyable. Why not? I like having a good time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=714.5s	714.5	 It's got to be efficacious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=717.1s	717.1	 You don't want to create a problem. You don't want to say right. I can stop the dog jumping up boom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=721.5s	721.5	 Look, he never jumps up again. Yeah, but he hates you so we don't want side effects, but most importantly the training has to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=728.4s	728.4	 Expedient in that it's suitable for the family mom dad and children many of my clients of children
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=736.9s	736.9	 Rather than putting label on it like don't try this at home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=740.4s	740.4	 Or you couldn't do this because this has taken me years of experience to learn this technique
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=744.8s	744.8	 Well, it's not expedient. So I'm into quick and easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=748.6s	748.6	 And in the notion of quick and easy. I also want to be giggling and have a good time doing it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=755.0s	755.0	 Yeah, exactly, you know and I the philosophy that I live by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=759.6s	759.6	 I'm gonna finish my soup it's getting cold. Oh keep going

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=764.4s	764.4	 I think that's very consistent with what dr. Dunbar is saying here as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=768.2s	768.2	 That having a highly trained dog is nothing more than a side effect of having an exceptional relationship with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=775.0s	775.0	 You can't I just can't beat that into people's heads enough put the relationship first and the training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=781.5s	781.5	 Though maybe not quite as simple as I make it out to be takes care of itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=785.1s	785.1	 It's true to a degree it is when you really take the time to bond and your dog sees that you care and that you're putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=791.0s	791.0	 That time in with them. Well, I mean you're going to get better results with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=794.2s	794.2	 but when you're trying to program them like like dr. Dunbar was saying you're you're not gonna have that result people because you're talking about how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=800.7s	800.7	 people are so focused on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=802.4s	802.4	 The mechanical aspect of it and they're applying a method rather than simply connecting with their dog, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=808.0s	808.0	 Yeah, I think both are important. You know, I think relationship is essential. It's number one. That's why we got a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=813.8s	813.8	 We want companionship we want protection
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=816.9s	816.9	 We want a dog to cuddle with on the couch and if you don't have that, you know, what's the point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=821.5s	821.5	 It's like, you know, why get married if you don't want to hug your spouse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=826.2s	826.2	 But I think science is important to that scientific principles of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=831.9s	831.9	 Quantifying behavior so we prove that it's changing the dog is learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=836.3s	836.3	 But I like and it's kind of like the title of my recent lecture series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=840.7s	840.7	 Science-based dog training with feeling I think so much of the feeling has disappeared from dog training and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=849.0s	849.0	 One of my favorite quotes is is an e Cummings quote give them the scalpel they would dissect a kiss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=855.2s	855.2	 And I think that's what's happened in dog training that people have become technicians. They don't say it's a good boy come here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=861.7s	861.7	 Oh, I'm very pleased with what you've done. They don't get clear instructions directions. They don't give analog feedback
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=868.2s	868.2	 The feedback is quantum. It's artificial. It's a click. It's a shock. It's a jerk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=873.4s	873.4	 It's a treat and I like feedback coming from the heart and I can communicate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=880.2s	880.2	 So much information with my voice. It's like, yes. Thank you. Good boy. Good boy or

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1363.8s	1363.8	 Now I think trainers became technicians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1366.8s	1366.8	 Now and to clarify you should clarify there I think with clicker training versus shot collars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1370.8s	1370.8	 For those that don't know I think most people do know clicker training is a form of positive reinforcement training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1374.8s	1374.8	 And you're not criticizing that aspect of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1376.8s	1376.8	 But what you're saying is you're criticizing the fact that it de-emphasizes the relationship between the two species
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1382.8s	1382.8	 We're not talking to the dog now we're saying yes good boy by going click and giving a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1387.8s	1387.8	 Or we're saying you're getting it wrong by giving a shock in shock training which I personally would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1395.8s	1395.8	 You might you would much rather see someone clicker train than shot collar train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1398.8s	1398.8	 Oh absolutely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1399.8s	1399.8	 But yeah that's neither here nor there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1400.8s	1400.8	 I use clickers myself to teach specific things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1403.8s	1403.8	 But in terms of establishing the relationship of living with your dog at home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1408.8s	1408.8	 Use your words talk to it because it communicates so much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1413.8s	1413.8	 You know than a quantum language
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1415.8s	1415.8	 So for example if a dog's doing the wrong thing he's chewing on the carpet in one word I say chew toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1422.8s	1422.8	 Which means stop chewing on the carpet get me chew toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1424.8s	1424.8	 He's about to jump up I'll say sit so he knows don't jump up sit to say hello
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1429.8s	1429.8	 He's about to peel on the carpet outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1432.8s	1432.8	 So one word communicates two pieces of information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1435.8s	1435.8	 You're getting it wrong and I want you to do this to get it back on track
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1439.8s	1439.8	 So and if the dog is being non-compliant I will then repeat the request if you like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1449.8s	1449.8	 And people like no what do you mean you said sit and the dog's not sitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1453.8s	1453.8	 Well this happened just the other night just yesterday driving in Atlanta
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1458.8s	1458.8	 And I said to the person driving stop and she didn't stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1461.8s	1461.8	 So I went stop she didn't stop I went stop and then she stopped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1465.8s	1465.8	 Well she's not being dominant or dissing me she just missed the first command
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1471.8s	1471.8	 And I think dogs are the same you say sit and the dog doesn't hear the word
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1475.8s	1475.8	 Because he's sniffing another dog's rear end
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1477.8s	1477.8	 So I repeat it and I repeat it and eventually now I end up with a dog that sits following a single request
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1484.8s	1484.8	 So we try this out and it works it's easier for a dog under duress for the corrections to be instructive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1493.8s	1493.8	 Let me give you an example a great example I look on dog training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1497.8s	1497.8	 Thank you I look on dog training is that takeaway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1500.8s	1500.8	 Pad Thai, soy, no egg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1504.8s	1504.8	 I look on dog training a very good analogy is learning tango
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1509.8s	1509.8	 So Kelly and I were learning tango
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1511.8s	1511.8	 Our teacher probably punished me 15 times a minute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1515.8s	1515.8	 Just keep making mistakes the punishment went like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1519.8s	1519.8	 No your left foot Ian your other left foot good that's fine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1523.8s	1523.8	 Well that's a punishment because it reduces the unwanted behavior in the technical sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1529.8s	1529.8	 But it wasn't nasty we actually giggled over it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1532.8s	1532.8	 I like to train the dogs this way if I say sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1535.8s	1535.8	 Negative punishment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1536.8s	1536.8	 If I say it's instructive I wouldn't say negative punishment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1540.8s	1540.8	 So you don't use the term negative punishment as opposed to positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1544.8s	1544.8	 I don't like using the term because people don't understand it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1547.8s	1547.8	 Right it sounds like a bad thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1548.8s	1548.8	 And I don't like using the technique because it's very ineffective it's hard to implement accurately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1555.8s	1555.8	 So it means you end a good time to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1558.8s	1558.8	 And positive punishment would be where you actually apply some type of force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1562.8s	1562.8	 I just don't want to get into that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1564.8s	1564.8	 I agree with you I completely agree with you on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1567.8s	1567.8	 Let alone dog trainers out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1569.8s	1569.8	 And that gets back to your point because that's where the current dog training discussion is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1573.8s	1573.8	 When it should be about connecting and understanding your dog and just living life together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1578.8s	1578.8	 Rather than focusing on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1579.8s	1579.8	 Well I think it should also be about connecting and understanding your client
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1583.8s	1583.8	 Who are mom dad and a five year old child
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1586.8s	1586.8	 So I'm not going to use a word like negative punishment, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, positive reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1590.8s	1590.8	 On and on and on iatrogenic aggression, idiopathic aggression
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1594.8s	1594.8	 I'm not going to use these terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1596.8s	1596.8	 I want to communicate to people in simple sentences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1599.8s	1599.8	 To teach them how to communicate to the dog in simple verbal commands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1604.8s	1604.8	 And motivate the dog to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1606.8s	1606.8	 So it is the big thing is the disappearance of language from animal training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1611.8s	1611.8	 We are humans we have the great advantage that we have language
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1616.8s	1616.8	 Let's use it to communicate to each other and dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1619.8s	1619.8	 And I actually said in my lecture today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1621.8s	1621.8	 I mean if we think it's bizarre that we don't use words when communicating with animals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1625.8s	1625.8	 What's more bizarre is the way we would communicate to spouses and children
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1630.8s	1630.8	 Like whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1632.8s	1632.8	 It's not a communication it's a cut off to stop communication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1636.8s	1636.8	 And if we actually talk and explain what we want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1640.8s	1640.8	 And why it's important that we want that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1642.8s	1642.8	 Strange enough we usually get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1644.8s	1644.8	 And then you know relationships are much easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1647.8s	1647.8	 So I look the big thing about this for me is that this dog training staff is a really safe forum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1653.8s	1653.8	 To look at communication and relationships between people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1657.8s	1657.8	 People are becoming technical and sterile and quantum in their communication with animals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1664.8s	1664.8	 And they're becoming more so when they teach the people in their classes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1668.8s	1668.8	 They're using acronyms, big long technical terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1672.8s	1672.8	 And I always talk to people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1674.8s	1674.8	 Today I had dog owners in my seminar for dog trainers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1678.8s	1678.8	 And I asked them, I said, is everything okay today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1680.8s	1680.8	 They said, we understood everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1682.8s	1682.8	 Because I always pitch the lecture at an eight year old girl sitting there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1686.8s	1686.8	 That's what it's pitched at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1688.8s	1688.8	 Because if I use terminology people won't understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1691.8s	1691.8	 Because I can not only use a learning theory terminology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1694.8s	1694.8	 I could use Latin based terms for medicine, psychological terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1699.8s	1699.8	 So you communicate nothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1701.8s	1701.8	 Right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1702.8s	1702.8	 You can't just say, oh I would classically condition the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1705.8s	1705.8	 What I would say is when someone comes to your house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1710.8s	1710.8	 Get them all to give the dog a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1712.8s	1712.8	 If they're men they give a tastier treat

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1719.8s	1719.8	 So the dog says, I love visitors, I really like men
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1723.8s	1723.8	 And bring on the children
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1725.8s	1725.8	 I wouldn't say classically condition the dog, you see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1729.8s	1729.8	 So I like talking in normal sentences to the people and to the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1734.8s	1734.8	 And so that's the message we need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1736.8s	1736.8	 And I try and do that too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1738.8s	1738.8	 To get out there is that it's just about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1741.8s	1741.8	 It's about that just authentic genuine communication with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1745.8s	1745.8	 That's what it all comes back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1747.8s	1747.8	 Many conventional dog trainers want to prove their worth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1750.8s	1750.8	 And how much they know and how many books they've read
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1752.8s	1752.8	 By doing what you're talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1754.8s	1754.8	 Rather than just say, take the time to understand your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1757.8s	1757.8	 Let them know when they're doing the right thing in a big way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1760.8s	1760.8	 Let them know when they're doing the wrong thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1762.8s	1762.8	 But really let them know when they're doing the right thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1764.8s	1764.8	 At least that's me, I'm not going to talk for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1766.8s	1766.8	 I want to interrupt right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1768.8s	1768.8	 That's all I tell them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1770.8s	1770.8	 I said dog training is really quite simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1772.8s	1772.8	 And changing the behavior of children and spouses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1776.8s	1776.8	 Catch them in the act doing something right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1778.8s	1778.8	 And say thank you, pure and simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1780.8s	1780.8	 Now the good behaviors will increase in frequency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1783.8s	1783.8	 And they squeeze out the bad behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1786.8s	1786.8	 With the best example of course being house training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1789.8s	1789.8	 If you praise a dog for peeing in the right place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1791.8s	1791.8	 Two things happen, he learns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1793.8s	1793.8	 Wow man, I love peeing in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1795.8s	1795.8	 Because I can cash in my urine for food treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1798.8s	1798.8	 But the second thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1800.8s	1800.8	 There's no more urine left to pee anywhere else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1803.8s	1803.8	 That's the way I look on behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1805.8s	1805.8	 If you're praising a dog for sitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1807.8s	1807.8	 He's spending a lot of time sitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1809.8s	1809.8	 So there's less time left for running around chasing a tail and jumping up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1812.8s	1812.8	 And occasionally let the dog know when it's doing it wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1815.8s	1815.8	 But use your voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1817.8s	1817.8	 And at the same time as telling him it's a boo boo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1819.8s	1819.8	 Outside, outside, outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1821.8s	1821.8	 Communicate what you want to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1823.8s	1823.8	 And that's it, there's your binary feedback
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1826.8s	1826.8	 Praise them when they get it right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1828.8s	1828.8	 Let them know when they're getting it wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1830.8s	1830.8	 And re-let them know what you want them to do to get it right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1833.8s	1833.8	 And then throw in some feeling and emotion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1835.8s	1835.8	 And you get a highly trained dog and notes on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1837.8s	1837.8	 Laughter, a few giggles, jolly routine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1839.8s	1839.8	 Waggy tail, a wee woo a bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq27e5hp4_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=658&pp=iAQB&t=1841.8s	1841.8	 And that's it, that's how you do it when you're running
