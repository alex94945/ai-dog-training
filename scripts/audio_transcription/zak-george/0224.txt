https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=19.4s	19.4	 I know, it's so good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=24.8s	24.8	 It tastes pretty good to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 And since dogs can smell and taste better than we can, they must find it absolutely

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 But I can assure you, if you get these points that we're going to cover, you're going to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=96.3s	96.3	 Heck, even I struggle with this sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=98.2s	98.2	 I mean, it can be hard to have an instant connection with a dog, especially when they're

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 Well, one place to start is by playing together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=126.4s	126.4	 There are two natural games that many dogs love to play straight away, and those are

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=135.8s	135.8	 lead to being able to teach them our language and customs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 See, by starting with play, you're communicating to your dog that you have a genuine interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=144.3s	144.3	 in doing something with your dog that comes naturally to them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=188.3s	188.3	 dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=230.8s	230.8	 for in virtually all dogs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=268.4s	268.4	 with a dog, like harsh training collars, for example.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 like a treat at first.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=282.4s	282.4	 trying to get into.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=287.9s	287.9	 in a much deeper way that's likely to stick and be generalized to other areas of your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 yes and no.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 But here's a huge tip that can skyrocket your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jH7--ovgNM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=225&pp=iAQB&t=312.4s	312.4	 Let the emphasis of your training be on yes instead of no.
