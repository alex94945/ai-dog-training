https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 And so when you're conditioning your dog like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 the idea is to just keep their mood pretty mellow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 and tolerant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 Mainly I'm just focusing on preventing fear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 or minimizing fear here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=214.7s	214.7	 That went pretty smooth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=215.6s	215.6	 So it's a good idea with a young dog like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 particularly during that fear period of eight to 11 weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=219.8s	219.8	 that you're really proactive about just letting them know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=222.5s	222.5	 hey, everything's cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=223.6s	223.6	 I'm gonna work on some general training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=225.5s	225.5	 We've done a little bit of lower training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 but not too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=227.9s	227.9	 So let's see how that goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=229.9s	229.9	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=230.9s	230.9	 Her sit's really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=232.2s	232.2	 Here the clicking sound means,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 great job, you've earned a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 I don't even have to really lure her much into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=237.8s	237.8	 She kind of just does it by default,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=239.5s	239.5	 but let's check and see how her down is doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 Down, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=246.3s	246.3	 And let's see if we can get her into an up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=249.5s	249.5	 Just gonna hold the piece of meat right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 I should mention too, I'm using a variety of treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=257.6s	257.6	 I'm using a combination of freeze dried meat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=259.9s	259.9	 freeze dried sweet potatoes, turkey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=262.5s	262.5	 sometimes a little bit of hot dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=264.2s	264.2	 So it really just depends on what she's in the mood for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=267.4s	267.4	 at any given moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 So we have our sit, our down, and up needs a little work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 That was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 Oh, look at her coming to life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 Our lower training is a little clunky right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=278.2s	278.2	 You can see she's being less than cooperative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=280.1s	280.1	 We're in that communication building phase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 We have not yet gotten very much traction on training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=284.3s	284.3	 which is expected at this age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 And this is, I think, why so many people get frustrated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=288.4s	288.4	 because it's like, yeah, I'm trying to give you real meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=290.8s	290.8	 I'm trying to teach you something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=291.6s	291.6	 But they're like, I don't want to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=292.4s	292.4	 I want to do this instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=293.7s	293.7	 We're gonna continue to work on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 over the next few months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 Come, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=298.3s	298.3	 Give her a big reward there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=300.0s	300.0	 I'm making it an early habit to give her some type of treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=302.6s	302.6	 or play virtually every time she comes to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=305.5s	305.5	 If you're the type of person who likes to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=307.2s	307.2	 a written guide to the things I've been showing you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=309.1s	309.1	 both of my books can help you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 They're also available in audio form too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 I'll have links below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=313.8s	313.8	 This is inertia's first introduction into our studio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 Very different smells in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=318.9s	318.9	 So we'll let her explore that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=320.7s	320.7	 Anytime you let your dog in a new place,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 it's important to let them acclimate, get comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=325.6s	325.6	 Don't push them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=326.5s	326.5	 Don't immediately start asking them to do things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 There's a toy on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=330.8s	330.8	 You can see she's interested in that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=332.9s	332.9	 Hey, what are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=334.2s	334.2	 You know, I think you're the first dog ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=336.3s	336.3	 who's tried to eat one of our prop plants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=338.4s	338.4	 So here's a good opportunity to redirect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=340.5s	340.5	 I'm gonna do one of those secondary training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=342.7s	342.7	 that I didn't plan and lure her away with a hot dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=345.8s	345.8	 get her into a sit and give her a reward there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=348.1s	348.1	 for doing so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=349.9s	349.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=350.7s	350.7	 I'm gonna go ahead and keep them coming just to let her know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=352.7s	352.7	 I like that she's holding that sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=354.3s	354.3	 And now I'll say, okay, good, all done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=356.6s	356.6	 I love that you're going for that ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 Now that she's comfortable with the studio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=359.9s	359.9	 or at least seems to be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=361.2s	361.2	 I really want to get her loving this place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=364.1s	364.1	 And there's no better way to get a dog loving anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=367.1s	367.1	 than to get them playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=368.3s	368.3	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=372.7s	372.7	 I'm whistling here because I'm not yet confident
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 that she'll respond to inertia come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 And I certainly don't want to condition her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=378.8s	378.8	 to ignore that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=379.8s	379.8	 Let's see what she does with rollover here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=381.8s	381.8	 Roll over, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=383.4s	383.4	 And now back the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=385.2s	385.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 Let's try play dead real quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=387.2s	387.2	 Let's set the tone for play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 It would be cool to get her on her back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=390.4s	390.4	 I don't know if she's gonna struggle with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=391.7s	391.7	 Like just hold her on her back like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=393.3s	393.3	 with her feet sticking up in the air maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=395.2s	395.2	 Stay, yes, there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=397.8s	397.8	 And that's why clicker training can be really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=399.6s	399.6	 because you can get those precise marking moments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=402.1s	402.1	 right there with her feet sticking straight up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=403.9s	403.9	 I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=405.5s	405.5	 Now she's using my hands to kind of brace on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=407.2s	407.2	 to like stay in that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=408.6s	408.6	 The stillness is what I've got to mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=410.4s	410.4	 and that is your weak point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=412.3s	412.3	 You don't know how to be still at all in her, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=415.8s	415.8	 Wanna try one more time since we got some momentum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=417.7s	417.7	 I'm waiting for her to just kind of pause
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=419.0s	419.0	 and look up rather than moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=421.4s	421.4	 Yes, did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=422.7s	422.7	 Ever so subtle, it was less than a quarter second of a pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=426.6s	426.6	 Very good, all right, so we're on our way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=428.3s	428.3	 I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=429.2s	429.2	 We'll continue to work on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=430.4s	430.4	 Oh, hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=431.5s	431.5	 And we'll see how she continues to do on that over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=434.4s	434.4	 That's one of those things that takes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=435.7s	435.7	 a lot of refining over weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=437.9s	437.9	 Right now I'm not really focusing on formally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=439.6s	439.6	 trying to train her a trick as much as I am
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=441.7s	441.7	 to just get her going into various positions with a lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=444.8s	444.8	 Her spin has been amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=446.7s	446.7	 That's one of her standout tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=448.1s	448.1	 The closest thing to a proper trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=449.8s	449.8	 that I've taught her so far,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=451.3s	451.3	 because this is like what, day four,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=452.8s	452.8	 I've really been focusing on letting her adjust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=454.7s	454.7	 and bonding with her and playing a lot with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=456.3s	456.3	 I'm always talking about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=457.5s	457.5	 You have to get traction on your communication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=459.4s	459.4	 because they're in and out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=460.5s	460.5	 That takes a bit of time to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=462.1s	462.1	 but that's probably the funnest part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=463.7s	463.7	 You can see her eye color is changing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=465.4s	465.4	 It's got kind of a greenish hue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=466.8s	466.8	 They started off a bit blue, now they're a bit green.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=469.4s	469.4	 Maybe they'll end up brown or something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 We'll see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=472.8s	472.8	 So she's found a shoelace to chew on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=474.6s	474.6	 Let's practice our redirecting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=476.3s	476.3	 This time I'm gonna see, rather than luring her away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=478.3s	478.3	 I'm gonna see if I can get her to come to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=480.3s	480.3	 because that's gonna be really handy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=481.8s	481.8	 And I'm just gonna make a high-pitched sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=483.9s	483.9	 Hey!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=485.7s	485.7	 Okay, that didn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=486.8s	486.8	 Brrrr!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=489.2s	489.2	 Be animated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=490.1s	490.1	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=490.9s	490.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=491.7s	491.7	 Getting playful really worked with her in that instance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=493.7s	493.7	 I could have gone up and lured her away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=495.4s	495.4	 and that's one way to get her to voluntarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=497.1s	497.1	 get off something, whether it be a shoe, her bed, a couch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=499.9s	499.9	 whatever it is that you're trying to keep them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=501.4s	501.4	 from chewing on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=502.3s	502.3	 But if I could get her to come to me with distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=504.9s	504.9	 and abandon the thing that she's so interested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=507.0s	507.0	 in chewing on, that's preferable to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 Now I suppose I could also pull her away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=511.2s	511.2	 but remember, that's not gonna teach her anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=513.2s	513.2	 She must voluntarily go through the motions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=515.3s	515.3	 of leaving the shoelace alone in order to even begin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=517.9s	517.9	 to understand this concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=519.4s	519.4	 Here we go again on the carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=520.7s	520.7	 You see how constant it is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=522.2s	522.2	 Brrrr!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=523.4s	523.4	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=524.3s	524.3	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=525.1s	525.1	 That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=525.9s	525.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=526.8s	526.8	 Leash biting is inevitable with most puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=528.8s	528.8	 They're gonna do it to some degree,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=530.0s	530.0	 but I want to discourage this from as early as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=533.4s	533.4	 I mean, she's teething, so we need to be aware of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=535.9s	535.9	 That's how she's engaging the world with her mouth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=538.2s	538.2	 but I have to show her there are better ways to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=540.1s	540.1	 But let's see if we can discourage that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=541.8s	541.8	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=543.2s	543.2	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=544.0s	544.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=544.8s	544.8	 Got it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=545.7s	545.7	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=546.5s	546.5	 Just to be clear, the strategy is interrupt your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=549.1s	549.1	 in a positive way, get them to respond to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=551.6s	551.6	 and reinforce with either food or play or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=554.2s	554.2	 that they really like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=555.6s	555.6	 That's the key with preventing habits like chewing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=557.9s	557.9	 and biting and all of these unwanted puppy behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=561.7s	561.7	 I'm gonna let a nurse to just chill out for a little bit now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=564.2s	564.2	 and that's kind of the pattern we've been falling into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=566.3s	566.3	 It's like five, 10, 12 minutes of play,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=568.7s	568.7	 and then she sleeps for like an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=570.3s	570.3	 Really common with puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=571.5s	571.5	 We're spending a lot of time in the studio today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=573.3s	573.3	 doing some work and everything,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=575.2s	575.2	 and the nurse is passed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=576.4s	576.4	 So this is something I really want to continue to emphasize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=579.5s	579.5	 throughout her puppyhood is the importance of handling them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=582.5s	582.5	 when they're in a very relaxed state of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=584.8s	584.8	 It's common for puppies to engage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=586.4s	586.4	 in frequent deep sleeping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=588.3s	588.3	 So this is a really good time to touch her nails
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=590.8s	590.8	 in between the webbing of her feet here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=592.9s	592.9	 because I really want her to be well adjusted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=595.0s	595.0	 Now let's see if we can do her teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=596.4s	596.4	 Here, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=597.2s	597.2	 You know, wouldn't it be great to get her to a point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=598.7s	598.7	 where you can just brush her teeth and her sleep?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=600.5s	600.5	 She's taking it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=601.3s	601.3	 I'm trying to imprint pretty hard here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=602.9s	602.9	 If she's not waking up to that, that's a good thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=604.9s	604.9	 I'm being pretty thorough here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=606.4s	606.4	 because if she's asleep, it can't be too irritating to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=609.2s	609.2	 Use discretion if you happen to have a real bitey puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=611.5s	611.5	 in this situation, don't insist on this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=613.3s	613.3	 but I'm getting to know her and I feel pretty safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=615.7s	615.7	 Let's try her tail for a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=617.2s	617.2	 I'm squeezing it, pinching that skin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=619.6s	619.6	 that tail in there a little bit, really massaging her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=622.9s	622.9	 And if your puppy is really irritable when you do this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=625.2s	625.2	 then be a bit more gentle when you interact with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=628.4s	628.4	 I've got a wet tissue here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=629.9s	629.9	 so it's a nice time to start prepping her for ear cleaning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=633.9s	633.9	 I think I poked her brain and triggered a dream.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=635.7s	635.7	 I wonder what she's dreaming about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=636.5s	636.5	 That's gotta be an awkward dream.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=637.4s	637.4	 Nice, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=638.4s	638.4	 You're so good at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=639.9s	639.9	 Get to the other one as you see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=641.6s	641.6	 Aw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=642.4s	642.4	 There I obviously pushed it a little too far and woke her up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=644.6s	644.6	 So, you know, I find the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=645.9s	645.9	 This is how you learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=646.9s	646.9	 I'll take that as a hint to back off for now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=649.2s	649.2	 and maybe on our next nap, I'll do some more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=651.4s	651.4	 and we'll see if we can make progress there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=653.1s	653.1	 The real time training of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=654.5s	654.5	 is probably about five, six minutes or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=657.2s	657.2	 Inertia, you are one good puppy so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=659.2s	659.2	 Inertia has just woken up from a nap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=661.1s	661.1	 So we're gonna take her on a potty break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=662.7s	662.7	 Seriously, her potty training is going so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=666.2s	666.2	 It's coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=667.1s	667.1	 There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=667.9s	667.9	 You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=669.9s	669.9	 Yes, very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=673.2s	673.2	 That air conditioning just kicked on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=675.1s	675.1	 and she reacted really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=677.0s	677.0	 So it can't hurt to follow up an event like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=679.8s	679.8	 with a couple of really tiny treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=681.7s	681.7	 Again, just solidifying that association with loud sounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=685.6s	685.6	 I get something cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=686.7s	686.7	 Everything's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=687.7s	687.7	 Especially during this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=688.9s	688.9	 Eight to nine weeks is a really important time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=690.9s	690.9	 to be very sensitive to your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=693.3s	693.3	 If they get nervous or thrown off by things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=694.6s	694.6	 because they're likely to experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=696.1s	696.1	 an increased rate of anxiety or fear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=698.5s	698.5	 during new things that they experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=700.3s	700.3	 or even things that they've already experienced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=702.4s	702.4	 This is not the time to really push heavy, heavy exposure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=705.5s	705.5	 to things in their face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=706.7s	706.7	 But if you have a good sense that your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=708.4s	708.4	 is likely to react well to new things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=710.2s	710.2	 that's a good thing to do too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=711.4s	711.4	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=712.4s	712.4	 This is a good time to work on our lure training outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=715.5s	715.5	 since we're here and she offered me that sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=717.7s	717.7	 She doesn't go into the down as readily out here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=719.6s	719.6	 because she's not as used to this texture here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=721.6s	721.6	 I mean, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=722.5s	722.5	 This is that New Orleans thick, firm grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=724.8s	724.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=725.6s	725.6	 We got a leaf over here in her mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=727.6s	727.6	 I wanted to let go of that leaf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=728.7s	728.7	 If I just pull it out, she's not gonna learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=730.9s	730.9	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=731.8s	731.8	 Wouldn't you rather have a hot dog than a leaf?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=734.2s	734.2	 When you, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=735.1s	735.1	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=736.9s	736.9	 There you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=737.7s	737.7	 That's much better than a leaf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=738.6s	738.6	 Now she's probably gonna go right back to the leaf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=740.3s	740.3	 So let me see if I can just escort her away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=742.5s	742.5	 before she does that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=744.4s	744.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=745.3s	745.3	 Classic redirect there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=746.9s	746.9	 Now I'm working up to not having to lure her away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=749.8s	749.8	 That was just an in the moment decision,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=751.9s	751.9	 but I'd much rather her come to me when I'm like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=754.1s	754.1	 inertia, come here, but she's still learning her name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=756.4s	756.4	 So I'm making high pitched sounds and being animated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=758.7s	758.7	 to encourage her to come to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=760.0s	760.0	 I'm using a combination of luring her away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=762.4s	762.4	 and being really animated and upbeat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=765.0s	765.0	 to call her away from things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=766.7s	766.7	 But since that was already in her mouth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=768.0s	768.0	 I didn't have much choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=769.1s	769.1	 I haven't done much formal look at me training yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=772.1s	772.1	 I've just kind of been doing it here and there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=773.5s	773.5	 because there's so much on her plate right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=775.9s	775.9	 I mean, adjusting to a new life and all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=777.5s	777.5	 So I'm not really pushing it too hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=780.4s	780.4	 Inertia, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=783.3s	783.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=784.1s	784.1	 Right there, I was excited about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=785.5s	785.5	 That was a real natural look at me when I asked for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=787.7s	787.7	 The way to teach them language, I think anyway,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=789.7s	789.7	 is to be very purposeful about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=791.4s	791.4	 Saying look at me or inertia or inertia, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=794.4s	794.4	 I mean, I want her responsive to a variety of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=796.8s	796.8	 Contextually, she'll learn the difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=798.7s	798.7	 between those nuances over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=800.8s	800.8	 So that's a real good example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfPzowbaL_w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=802.0s	802.0	 We came out here for a potty break.
