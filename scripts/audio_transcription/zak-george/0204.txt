https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=4.1s	4.1	 A dog that would represent many of the same issues that many of you were working on with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=8.7s	8.7	 your own dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=9.7s	9.7	 You're a good dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 Wow, you are good looking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=12.7s	12.7	 Eyes are amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=13.9s	13.9	 On this day, I walked into the shelter and dogs were just barking everywhere and every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=18.8s	18.8	 one of them seemed to be saying, give me a chance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 And there was George looking pretty much like every other dog in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=25.3s	25.3	 And I was in for one of the most challenging and memorable experiences I've ever had training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=30.8s	30.8	 any dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=31.8s	31.8	 I'm Zach George and this is George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=35.1s	35.1	 No relations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=36.3s	36.3	 George has spent the last four months living in an animal shelter with minimal contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=40.6s	40.6	 with other dogs or people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=42.5s	42.5	 This is one of the strongest dogs I have ever worked with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 How would I ever get a frisbee away from a dog that's pulling like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=50.1s	50.1	 Holy cow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 In our part of the world, dogs that look like George have the deck stacked against them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=55.2s	55.2	 from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=56.3s	56.3	 We took George out of the shelter having no idea where he would end up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 He is my responsibility at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=62.3s	62.3	 If he goes back to that shelter, he has almost no hope of standing out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 He's a totally untrained dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=68.3s	68.3	 His drive is really intense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 We have to get this pulling under control with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=72.8s	72.8	 And it's my job to transform him from a wild and crazy dog to an incredible pet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=77.7s	77.7	 Seems straightforward, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 He's calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=80.7s	80.7	 He's calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=81.7s	81.7	 He's calm.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=84.9s	84.9	 He's caught off guard by a stranger in the area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 He has what seems to be a fear response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=90.8s	90.8	 Buddy, it's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=91.8s	91.8	 It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=92.8s	92.8	 Inertia was kind of telling him off a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 Oh, uh-uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=95.9s	95.9	 She's like, yo, I don't play like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 You need to back off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=100.6s	100.6	 He's getting a little impatient here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=102.3s	102.3	 He's refusing sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 He's pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=104.4s	104.4	 He's just not listening at all right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=107.2s	107.2	 People interpret this behavior as being stubborn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=109.5s	109.5	 We're getting ready to go out tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 I'm a little worried about him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 Oh gosh, he's in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=114.1s	114.1	 Unattended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=115.1s	115.1	 George, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=117.1s	117.1	 I never thought the thing that would take me down as a dog trainer would be this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=122.9s	122.9	 Not getting that ball, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 I've never been in this much of a physical gridlock with any dog, ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 Holy cow.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 out their phone and they record this, like, this could look really ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=141.7s	141.7	 And then I look up and I realize my wife is filming this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=144.9s	144.9	 I had an incredible outburst out of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 George just lost it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 How am I ever going to teach him to let go of something when his grip and his strength

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 You know, in this case, I guess they would be right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 George is a dog like I've never known before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 Only a handful of dogs have ever been able to pull off the double disc catch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=183.2s	183.2	 I just keep hoping that it's going to, like, click and he's going to just catch one and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=202.8s	202.8	 I understand the greater calling is to be able to bring a dog into our life, to train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 them and to find them a great home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 I don't know if I can let this dog go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 Let go!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 You can tell that he's really trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=220.3s	220.3	 He's really understanding the concept.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=284.4s	284.4	 The other day we went to our local shelter looking for the ideal candidate for this series,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=289.8s	289.8	 and I think I may have found him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=292.2s	292.2	 Keep in mind, this dog is a homeless dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=294.4s	294.4	 He has no home to go back to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=295.9s	295.9	 All right, well, we've just gotten them all suited up and we're taking them out of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=299.8s	299.8	 shelter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=300.8s	300.8	 He's pretty wired already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 I think the first thing we need to do is go get him a really good walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 He hasn't been in public in months, so this should be interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=308.9s	308.9	 If you guys want to make sure you see every episode, subscribe to my channel and click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=312.8s	312.8	 that bell notification so you get notified.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=315.3s	315.3	 All right, you and me, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=317.4s	317.4	 The first thing I want to do with George is take him to a park, see how he does in public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=321.9s	321.9	 and get an idea of what we really need to work on with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=325.6s	325.6	 So far he's doing well in the crate, so this is good news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=328.6s	328.6	 George was actually found on the streets about three or four months ago, somewhere right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=332.5s	332.5	 around here, and he's not left the shelter once, so this is going to be a pretty big
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=336.3s	336.3	 day for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=337.4s	337.4	 There's a big pit bull in my car right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=339.7s	339.7	 Well, you can tell he's like, where am I?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=342.2s	342.2	 Let me get him secured to me since we're in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=345.3s	345.3	 All right, we're going to go take a walk at the park, see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=349.6s	349.6	 So right off the bat, he's pretty excited to be in public, pretty understandable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=352.8s	352.8	 He's definitely pulling on the leash quite a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=355.2s	355.2	 But my objective right here is number one, give him some leisure time because he's been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=359.5s	359.5	 in such a crazy shelter environment for so long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=362.5s	362.5	 And secondly, just kind of see what I need to work on with him over the next weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=366.6s	366.6	 I'm not going to focus on training during this walk at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=369.6s	369.6	 It's too soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=370.8s	370.8	 I don't know enough about him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 He certainly doesn't have any communication with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 We're just trying to do a science experiment here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=377.6s	377.6	 You might notice I've got a handle here on his leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 I also have a handle here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=382.3s	382.3	 We have a lot of harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=383.3s	383.3	 I really want to make sure I have many options to gain control of him if I need to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=388.6s	388.6	 George does not have a known bite history or anything, so I'm not putting a muzzle on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=392.9s	392.9	 him like we did with Moira when we first took her out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=396.5s	396.5	 Some of the first things that I'm noticing with him, he's very alert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=399.3s	399.3	 He's looking at things all over the place, trying to understand this new place he's in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=403.4s	403.4	 I'm real curious to see how he does when he sees a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=406.4s	406.4	 Like is that an issue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=407.4s	407.4	 Are we going to have to work on reactivity or is it going to be mainly obedience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=410.5s	410.5	 Or is he going to excel?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=411.7s	411.7	 Maybe he's a trick dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=412.7s	412.7	 I have no idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=414.2s	414.2	 Something or everything has his attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=415.7s	415.7	 Just look at his eyes, his ears and his nose as he's trying to explore this environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=419.2s	419.2	 right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=420.2s	420.2	 Here comes a bike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=421.2s	421.2	 I always like to see how dogs do with bikes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=424.4s	424.4	 Noticed it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=425.4s	425.4	 Pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=427.3s	427.3	 Looks like a happy guy so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=428.3s	428.3	 He's pretty goofy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=429.3s	429.3	 All right, let's keep moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=431.7s	431.7	 See how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=432.7s	432.7	 I'm intentionally keeping him off the beaten path right now because I don't want to over-stimulate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=436.6s	436.6	 him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=437.6s	437.6	 I mean, who knows what's going through his mind?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=439.1s	439.1	 Just a few minutes ago, he was in a shelter and was into his routine, whatever that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=443.3s	443.3	 like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=444.3s	444.3	 So this is quite different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=445.3s	445.3	 I literally asked him if he's been outside the shelter and they said, no, he hasn't been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=448.6s	448.6	 out since he came in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=449.6s	449.6	 And that was January 14th, which was several months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=452.7s	452.7	 Hey, George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=453.7s	453.7	 What's up, buddy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=454.7s	454.7	 How are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=456.0s	456.0	 Good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=457.0s	457.0	 Oh, all right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=458.4s	458.4	 So the second you talk to him, he tends to get really excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=461.5s	461.5	 What are you so crazy for?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=463.3s	463.3	 You look like a catfish head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=466.9s	466.9	 If you knew you looked like that, you wouldn't act so crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=469.8s	469.8	 At the shelter, there were some people that were interested in him, but they were really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=474.6s	474.6	 scared off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=475.6s	475.6	 And I can see why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=476.6s	476.6	 Oh, man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=477.6s	477.6	 Oh, boy, those nails are kind of crazy here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=480.9s	480.9	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=481.9s	481.9	 Oh, we've got roller blades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=483.9s	483.9	 Got easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=485.7s	485.7	 Apparently, this is a big part of his problem getting adopted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=488.6s	488.6	 Whoops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=489.6s	489.6	 As he gets a little a little amped up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=493.2s	493.2	 Okay, gets really excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=495.6s	495.6	 Easy, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=496.6s	496.6	 Most claws easy are very okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=499.8s	499.8	 Whoa, chill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=500.8s	500.8	 That's enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=501.9s	501.9	 So jumping something we'll have to work on with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=504.9s	504.9	 He's got really sharp claws, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=507.2s	507.2	 You can see right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=508.4s	508.4	 That's just on my arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=509.7s	509.7	 That's definitely something we're going to have to address.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=512.1s	512.1	 See how he does with birds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=514.1s	514.1	 Wildlife is always a wild card for dogs in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=516.8s	516.8	 Some dogs will really be into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=518.6s	518.6	 Other dogs will be like, I don't care so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=520.5s	520.5	 And many dogs will be somewhere in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=522.3s	522.3	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=523.3s	523.3	 There's a skateboard going by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=524.3s	524.3	 He's noticing them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=525.3s	525.3	 Got roller blades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=526.3s	526.3	 But he doesn't seem too interested, which is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=529.3s	529.3	 But he is very interested in stuff that's on the ground here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=532.8s	532.8	 Wonder if we'll have to work with him on staying off of furniture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=537.1s	537.1	 Huh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=538.1s	538.1	 All right, he sees a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=545.1s	545.1	 Hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=549.1s	549.1	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=551.1s	551.1	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=555.1s	555.1	 Did you guys see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=556.1s	556.1	 That dog was so excited to interact with George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=559.1s	559.1	 And George was like, I'm more interested in other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=561.1s	561.1	 I'll be interested to see if that sticks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=563.1s	563.1	 But I kind of love the fact that he's not lunging after other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=567.1s	567.1	 I'm always talking about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=568.1s	568.1	 Every time we take on one of these dogs, they all have their own set of individual issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=572.1s	572.1	 No two of these series are really going to be alike, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=576.1s	576.1	 Hey, good job, sir.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=577.1s	577.1	 Here's an actual barking dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=579.1s	579.1	 Although he's probably really desensitized to barking dogs having been in the shelter for so long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=584.1s	584.1	 It's hard to tell if he's like this all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=586.1s	586.1	 There are so many variables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=587.1s	587.1	 I mean, his life is changing like crazy right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=590.1s	590.1	 But he is definitely strong and definitely a leash puller.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=594.1s	594.1	 I mean, you can see he's trying to pull me into the water right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=597.1s	597.1	 There's a duck right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=599.1s	599.1	 Right now, George is watching this kid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=602.1s	602.1	 You see the duck?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=605.1s	605.1	 He's very aware.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=606.1s	606.1	 Let's see how he does with this other dog that passes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=608.1s	608.1	 Right now, I've got some tension on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=610.1s	610.1	 He's definitely a little more excited by this dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=612.1s	612.1	 Definitely pulling more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=613.1s	613.1	 You can see the second I give him an inch, he takes a foot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=617.1s	617.1	 So I'm going to keep a good grip on him here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=620.1s	620.1	 Just because he was good as one dog went by doesn't mean he's going to be good when every dog goes by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=626.1s	626.1	 OK, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=627.1s	627.1	 See, now that was interesting before he showed no interest in the duck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=630.1s	630.1	 But I noticed when they started rapidly getting away from him, he charged right at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=635.1s	635.1	 Normal behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=636.1s	636.1	 He probably just wants to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=637.1s	637.1	 But if you're not prepared for that and get you off guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=640.1s	640.1	 So lunches at ducks sometimes noted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=643.1s	643.1	 But George is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=644.1s	644.1	 Oh, jeez.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=647.1s	647.1	 OK, watch out, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=649.1s	649.1	 I see that's if you're not really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=657.1s	657.1	 OK, come on, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=660.1s	660.1	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=662.1s	662.1	 Just got total leash burn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=664.1s	664.1	 So he definitely needs some help with his impulse control, to say the least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=668.1s	668.1	 Wildlife seems to be very tempting for him so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=671.1s	671.1	 OK, so it does look like he likes to scavenge off the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=675.1s	675.1	 Hey, there's all sorts of duck poop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=677.1s	677.1	 No, you can't do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=679.1s	679.1	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=680.1s	680.1	 He doesn't know. Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=681.1s	681.1	 Come on, let's go over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=683.1s	683.1	 I'm going to pull him away from that because I don't know what he's eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=686.1s	686.1	 So we definitely need to train him how to leave stuff alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=689.1s	689.1	 He knows it. Almost every dog you'll ever meet knows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=692.1s	692.1	 Let me see. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=694.1s	694.1	 Good. Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=697.1s	697.1	 Looks like he's trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=698.1s	698.1	 I'm not using any treats or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=700.1s	700.1	 I'm just really trying to see what he knows and what he doesn't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=704.1s	704.1	 Let's do sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=706.1s	706.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=708.1s	708.1	 OK, doesn't seem to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=710.1s	710.1	 Stay. So leash pulling, basic obedience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=712.1s	712.1	 These are things that definitely need some work with them that I'm seeing so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=716.1s	716.1	 And half the time, that's all these dogs really need to make the best homes possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=720.1s	720.1	 But people are very often scared by the reputation of pit bull type dogs or the way they look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=725.1s	725.1	 I mean, they can be very intimidating looking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=727.1s	727.1	 They're very strong dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=728.1s	728.1	 There can be a stigma around pit bull type dogs for a number of valid reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=732.1s	732.1	 And we'll dive deeper into that topic later in the series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=735.1s	735.1	 But in general, they can be some of the best dogs in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=738.1s	738.1	 And that's really what I'm hoping to show throughout this series with a dog like George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=742.1s	742.1	 So I want to make it clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=743.1s	743.1	 He is my responsibility at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=745.1s	745.1	 I mean, he's out of the shelter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=747.1s	747.1	 I'm not taking him back to that shelter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=749.1s	749.1	 But while we're out here, I think I should give him an extended free walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=752.1s	752.1	 See if we can get some of that extra energy out of him before we introduce him to our house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=756.1s	756.1	 Because I have no reason to believe that this dog has ever even been inside of a house before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=761.1s	761.1	 So I want to make my job as easy as possible by getting him satisfied mentally, by checking out the environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=767.1s	767.1	 taking a nice long walk, as well as physically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=770.1s	770.1	 That can be pretty obnoxious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=772.1s	772.1	 So we're getting a little sideways pulling action over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=777.1s	777.1	 So sometimes he does OK on leash, but then sometimes he's like just pulling straight ahead or pulling sideways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=784.1s	784.1	 Not very compliant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=785.1s	785.1	 I think we can make a lot of improvement on this behavior over the next couple of weeks for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=790.1s	790.1	 You know, at no point here in this particular stretch is the leash even close to being loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=795.1s	795.1	 There are a lot of people who are really tool focused when it comes to training dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=799.1s	799.1	 And they think that by having a harness like this on a dog that you're encouraging the goodness gracious that you're encouraging the pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=808.1s	808.1	 Come on now back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=810.1s	810.1	 I just want to brace when he lunges out like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=812.1s	812.1	 There were some ducks over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=814.1s	814.1	 So so far he's lunged at ducks at least three times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=817.1s	817.1	 I use a Y shaped harness like this while I'm teaching dogs not to pull on the leash because it avoids putting pressure on their most sensitive areas,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=824.1s	824.1	 like their throat and their joints.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=826.1s	826.1	 When you're teaching a dog to walk politely, considering what is actually causing them to pull will help you make progress much faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=832.1s	832.1	 So here George pulled because he wanted to lunge at those ducks, not because he's wearing a harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=839.1s	839.1	 Shoot. Whoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=841.1s	841.1	 You can see why birds are so intriguing to dogs, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=844.1s	844.1	 They're flapping their wings, getting off the ground, moving quick and erratically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=848.1s	848.1	 And I don't have any reason to believe you would do anything to a bird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=851.1s	851.1	 He's just very intrigued by them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=853.1s	853.1	 But nonetheless, I can totally derail a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=856.1s	856.1	 You can just hear his breathing as he pulls along here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=861.1s	861.1	 I'm letting him get away with it now because there's still much to teach him before we can expect him to walk nicely on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=866.1s	866.1	 But I can already tell this dog is going to be an amazing pet to somebody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=870.1s	870.1	 George. So you can see, I mean, I call him and he doesn't just immediately turn to me yet, which is to be expected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=877.1s	877.1	 We haven't taught him to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=878.1s	878.1	 But he's very much not focused on me and very focused on his environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=882.1s	882.1	 That is another thing that I think we can improve on as well throughout his time with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=886.1s	886.1	 So we're going to put him back in the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=888.1s	888.1	 We're going to go back home, let him get adjusted there and see what he thinks of everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=893.1s	893.1	 OK, here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=900.1s	900.1	 Interesting. So many things to look at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=903.1s	903.1	 You already smell dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=904.1s	904.1	 First thing I want to do with any dog is show them the place to go and do their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=909.1s	909.1	 We're going to come back here. You have to go potty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=915.1s	915.1	 Good. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=919.1s	919.1	 So we're going to try and keep house training going like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=924.1s	924.1	 That was a good start for house training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=926.1s	926.1	 He peed immediately. As far as I know, he's never been inside a house before, so I'm not going to assume by any stretch that he's house trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=933.1s	933.1	 So we'll be taking him out quite frequently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=935.1s	935.1	 That's great. Let's go inside. Let's go see the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=938.1s	938.1	 I haven't even turned on the lights in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=940.1s	940.1	 Look how we went right in the crate. You got to love that. That's a good start to crate training for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=945.1s	945.1	 You want to see the kitchen? What do you think of the kitchen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=949.1s	949.1	 You can see he's like, whoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=951.1s	951.1	 A little suspect, but still the curiosity gets the best of him and he wants to investigate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=959.1s	959.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=961.1s	961.1	 Hello. Hello. Oh my god.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=964.1s	964.1	 Too much. This is why you're having a hard time. You get too excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=969.1s	969.1	 Too excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=971.1s	971.1	 Here. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=974.1s	974.1	 So that's it. Yes. That's so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=977.1s	977.1	 Looks awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=979.1s	979.1	 I mean, he goes right in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=983.1s	983.1	 Yep. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=985.1s	985.1	 So what if I do this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=991.1s	991.1	 Nice job. These are sweet potato treats I'm using from Pupford and they are doing the trick just fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=997.1s	997.1	 Look at that. Nice work, sir.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1001.1s	1001.1	 Very good. I'm going to go ahead and give him a few in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1004.1s	1004.1	 Since he's doing so well in the crate, I'm going to give him a really good chew just to get him immediately acclimated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1010.1s	1010.1	 Doesn't look like he's showing any signs of stress at all here, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1013.1s	1013.1	 We had Pupford immediately overnight these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1017.1s	1017.1	 So these are specifically for large dogs that like to chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1021.1s	1021.1	 This is a Yak Cheese Dog Chew and our Turbo Tendons have been a hit for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1028.1s	1028.1	 I'm going to give him one of these or should I give him one of these?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1031.1s	1031.1	 I'm going to give him a Yak Cheese Chew. Why not? Let's see how he likes it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1035.1s	1035.1	 And I want to give this to him straight away just so he doesn't have time to think about being in a crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1041.1s	1041.1	 And I'm going to take him out of the crate, but I want us to get settled as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1046.1s	1046.1	 Oh boy, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1049.1s	1049.1	 He loves it instantly. He loves to chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1052.1s	1052.1	 So I'm a little worried about the bed, but we'll see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1055.1s	1055.1	 Apparently those sores on his feet are related to not having a soft surface to lay down on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1061.1s	1061.1	 He seems pretty happy right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1063.1s	1063.1	 That is a perfect chew for him because he's the kind of dog who will devour something very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1068.1s	1068.1	 And you can see on this, he's like really going at it and it is not going anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1072.1s	1072.1	 When you want to set your dog up for success or get them comfortable with crate training, this is one way to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1076.1s	1076.1	 Puppet has lots of options for various types of chews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1080.1s	1080.1	 I use their treats all the time in training as I'm going to be doing later on with George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1085.1s	1085.1	 He's actually done really well in the crate year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1087.1s	1087.1	 I want to put him on the tie out now so he has a little bit more freedom as we get to know him here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1092.1s	1092.1	 Man, he is so strong. You can tell by looking at him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1095.1s	1095.1	 But I feel like he's twice as strong as he looks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1099.1s	1099.1	 Let's go ahead and give him a chew here just to acclimate for a little bit before we jump into doing anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1104.1s	1104.1	 Let's try a turbo tendon. Look at that sit for a treat. I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1108.1s	1108.1	 So he clearly knows sit for a treat, but I'm not convinced he knows much of anything else just yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1113.1s	1113.1	 So we've got to figure out what really motivates George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1116.1s	1116.1	 We have to understand his currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1118.1s	1118.1	 Those come in two major forms, either some type of food or some type of play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1123.1s	1123.1	 For treats, I mean, clearly we can see he likes the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1126.1s	1126.1	 We know that already, right? He'll do a sit. He gobbles a sweet potato treats right up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1131.1s	1131.1	 Here you go. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1133.1s	1133.1	 So a tug toy is a pretty classic toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1135.1s	1135.1	 Let's see if we can get him interested in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1137.1s	1137.1	 And as quickly as I said that, look at him. He's all interested in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1142.1s	1142.1	 I don't know that he's ever played with a tug toy in his life or even knows how to play tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1149.1s	1149.1	 Okay, there he goes. He's getting pretty excited about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1152.1s	1152.1	 Easy. Now he is also getting pretty wound up. Okay, this is crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1156.1s	1156.1	 This is going to be very convincing to a lot of potential families that he might be a good dog. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1163.1s	1163.1	 But I can see that he's really engaged with it and he's very strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1167.1s	1167.1	 So sometimes tug can be a really good way to motivate a dog. Good boy. Good. I love this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1176.1s	1176.1	 Got to be real careful though, because again, I have no idea if he's ever played tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1181.1s	1181.1	 Now, some people look at this and say, man, you're getting that dog really amped up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1184.1s	1184.1	 And it's true. But if you can get them this excited about something, then you can use that to your advantage when training them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1190.1s	1190.1	 Let's see if we can get him to let go. Does he respond to the oak tree method? I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1194.1s	1194.1	 Let's see. I'm just going to wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1197.1s	1197.1	 Oh, he's pretty intense about this toy, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1202.1s	1202.1	 This kind of intensity in a toy is a double edged sword.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1206.1s	1206.1	 On one hand, it's good that you have something they're interested in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1209.1s	1209.1	 On the other hand, it can make them a truly wild, wild animal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1213.1s	1213.1	 But I love training with tug toys like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1219.1s	1219.1	 Easy. Just let's go by accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1222.1s	1222.1	 I can let him know that I like that by bringing the toy back to life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1231.1s	1231.1	 Easy. Let me see something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1234.1s	1234.1	 OK, you got a little distracted and that was enough here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1237.1s	1237.1	 But I know I just got lucky. This dog does not know let go at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1243.1s	1243.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1247.1s	1247.1	 Trying to see how easily I can get him into a groove of tug and let go and then maybe sit for the toy so we can earn it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1253.1s	1253.1	 That way we can start establishing some basic communication of when you do what I want, you get what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1260.1s	1260.1	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1262.1s	1262.1	 Yes, just like that. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1265.1s	1265.1	 Very good. Boy, look at that tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1268.1s	1268.1	 So it's a matter of just polishing this up and teaching him how to appropriately play with a toy like this during training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1274.1s	1274.1	 It's turning into a pretty epic tug of war training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1277.1s	1277.1	 And the other huge benefit to doing tug of war with him is that I'm playing with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1281.1s	1281.1	 You can see how much fun he's having when you get your dog associating that kind of fun with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1286.1s	1286.1	 They're far more easy to train moving forward because they just enjoy working with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1290.1s	1290.1	 It's one of the great things about focusing on keeping training enjoyable and fun for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1295.1s	1295.1	 Yes. Good. Good boy. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1300.1s	1300.1	 But I think I have my answer as to what the currencies are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1304.1s	1304.1	 It looks like I can easily use food and play as a currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1308.1s	1308.1	 And if you watch me for any length of time, you know, I get very excited by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1312.1s	1312.1	 So he likes tug. I wonder if he'll play fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1315.1s	1315.1	 You can see with this kind of energy, it's going to be handy to be able to get that energy released.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1319.1s	1319.1	 So he went right after it. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1321.1s	1321.1	 I'm going to encourage him to come back over here just to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1324.1s	1324.1	 I like to start with fetch as soon as possible because not only does it give a dog an outlet to be able to communicate with a person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1331.1s	1331.1	 in a way that they were bred to do by working with people, but it also gets him tired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1336.1s	1336.1	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1338.1s	1338.1	 The most reliable way I can get a toy back from George at this point is when he naturally gets distracted by something in his environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1344.1s	1344.1	 Good job. Ready? Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1346.1s	1346.1	 George, come on. You got to bring it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1350.1s	1350.1	 Come on. Let's go. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1353.1s	1353.1	 Where's your toy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1355.1s	1355.1	 But toys like this aren't to be chewed on, which is also something that he wants to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1360.1s	1360.1	 I like to keep toys like this special, use them as currencies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1363.1s	1363.1	 Can you sit? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1366.1s	1366.1	 And just like with tug, I'm going to go ahead and give him the toy right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1369.1s	1369.1	 Yeah. I see him kind of pulling away from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1374.1s	1374.1	 That's something I want to nip in the bud if I can, easier said than done, because he wants to keep it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1379.1s	1379.1	 I tried to get him to play tug, then I'm going to immediately throw it right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1383.1s	1383.1	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1385.1s	1385.1	 So he showed some promise with fetch, but he needs some work on being taught how to return it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1390.1s	1390.1	 Pretty interesting first fetch training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1392.1s	1392.1	 See how he puts that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1394.1s	1394.1	 I just want to be extra careful about taking a toy away from him, so I wanted to distract him with that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1398.1s	1398.1	 I think you've had enough. Let's go take a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1400.1s	1400.1	 You want to go take a break? It's getting late.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1402.1s	1402.1	 Okay, we'll take a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1405.1s	1405.1	 George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1407.1s	1407.1	 I think he responded to his name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1409.1s	1409.1	 So it looks like at the shelter, they've at least worked with him on responding to his name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1413.1s	1413.1	 That was pretty good. Sit. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1416.1s	1416.1	 Perfect. I got a pretty good feeling about George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1418.1s	1418.1	 He is off to a lightning quick start here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1421.1s	1421.1	 I mean, I'm thinking this dog is a genius, but we'll find out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1425.1s	1425.1	 We'll find out. One of the very first things that I teach any dog is how to look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1429.1s	1429.1	 Got to be able to get his attention on me when I ask for it, especially when he encounters things like birds or any other distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1437.1s	1437.1	 Anytime he comes to me, by the way, I'm going to give him a treat or something that really makes it worthwhile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1442.1s	1442.1	 George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1448.1s	1448.1	 Yes. Right there. I just made a sound with my mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1451.1s	1451.1	 He looked immediately up to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1453.1s	1453.1	 Any acknowledgement I get from him, I'm going to reward, but I want him to be very specifically looking at my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1458.1s	1458.1	 So yes, I got some accidental eye contact there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1463.1s	1463.1	 I'm using the freeze dried salmon right here from Pupbird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1467.1s	1467.1	 I mean, you can tell it's real salmon dogs love this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1470.1s	1470.1	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1472.1s	1472.1	 Here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1474.1s	1474.1	 I'm just making a motion with my hand, making a sound with my mouth, anything to get him to look up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1480.1s	1480.1	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1483.1s	1483.1	 He's really trying to get those toys. If you're wondering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1485.1s	1485.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1488.1s	1488.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1490.1s	1490.1	 Just rewarding any brief second that he looks at my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1493.1s	1493.1	 I'm also on the ground very intentionally right now just to be easier to to work with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1499.1s	1499.1	 Hey, we'll play with those toys later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1503.1s	1503.1	 If you're wondering, I could use the toys as well, but I'm trying to kind of keep them a little bit calmer for this particular training lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1509.1s	1509.1	 George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1511.1s	1511.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1512.1s	1512.1	 Notice how he's off leash right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1514.1s	1514.1	 He's free to go anywhere, not forcing him to do anything, getting him to comply willingly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1520.1s	1520.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1522.1s	1522.1	 I mean, I had a habit said come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1524.1s	1524.1	 I don't think he knows what that means, but I think the tone was inviting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1533.1s	1533.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1534.1s	1534.1	 Waiting for his eyes to move from my hand to my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1536.1s	1536.1	 You see that you can get creative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1538.1s	1538.1	 You could hold a treat up like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1540.1s	1540.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1542.1s	1542.1	 Put my hands behind my back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1543.1s	1543.1	 I could say, yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1547.1s	1547.1	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1548.1s	1548.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1549.1s	1549.1	 We're not that friendly just yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1551.1s	1551.1	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1553.1s	1553.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1554.1s	1554.1	 Good boy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1557.1s	1557.1	 Let me see if I can put a term to it so that he can start to understand what I'm asking for so I can be a little bit more clear on the future when it's necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1567.1s	1567.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1568.1s	1568.1	 Look at me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1572.1s	1572.1	 Just insisting on some acknowledgement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1576.1s	1576.1	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1581.1s	1581.1	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1583.1s	1583.1	 Look at me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1587.1s	1587.1	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1588.1s	1588.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1589.1s	1589.1	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1590.1s	1590.1	 You're getting it, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1591.1s	1591.1	 You're a smart one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1593.1s	1593.1	 Good job, sir.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1594.1s	1594.1	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1595.1s	1595.1	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1595.1s	1595.1	 Looks really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1596.1s	1596.1	 So you might have noticed throughout all of our training so far here that I've been really teaching him what the word yes means in very specific contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1604.1s	1604.1	 And I've been doing that by giving him a treat or some play every time I say the word yes, as we talked about earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1610.1s	1610.1	 But it's also important for our dogs to understand the word no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1613.1s	1613.1	 Now, I will say that when we teach our dogs the word no, we need to be very sparing about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1618.1s	1618.1	 We don't want to just rely on teaching them no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1622.1s	1622.1	 So the emphasis of our training really needs to be on the word yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1626.1s	1626.1	 Nonetheless, the word no does have some practical application.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1629.1s	1629.1	 So we're going to teach him the difference between yes and no right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1633.1s	1633.1	 I like to do this by teaching a dog how to leave a treat alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1636.1s	1636.1	 So I'm going to you can see if I just put a treat in my hand right there, he goes right for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1640.1s	1640.1	 Why wouldn't he? Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1641.1s	1641.1	 But let's say I don't want him to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1643.1s	1643.1	 I mean, we saw earlier at the park how he was picking things up off the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1646.1s	1646.1	 It would be really nice for him to understand what the term leave it alone means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1650.1s	1650.1	 When he goes for it, I'm going to pull it away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1652.1s	1652.1	 No. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1654.1s	1654.1	 You can see how I said the word no as I pulled the treat away there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1659.1s	1659.1	 No. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1661.1s	1661.1	 So I said no as he went for the treat, pulled it away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1664.1s	1664.1	 So there was a consequence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1668.1s	1668.1	 Yes. But when he showed restraint, I said yes and immediately gave him that treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1677.1s	1677.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1680.1s	1680.1	 I can't believe this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1684.1s	1684.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1685.1s	1685.1	 This dog was living in a shelter moments ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1689.1s	1689.1	 Had never had any serious training and is catching on this quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1695.1s	1695.1	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1696.1s	1696.1	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1701.1s	1701.1	 Yes. It's called leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1703.1s	1703.1	 What happens if I drop it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1706.1s	1706.1	 He goes right for it because it has motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1708.1s	1708.1	 Remember, things that move are more exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1710.1s	1710.1	 This time when I drop it, I'm going to cover it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1712.1s	1712.1	 So he understands just because it drops doesn't mean you get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1715.1s	1715.1	 We're going to wait for him to show some restraint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1717.1s	1717.1	 And in the beginning, even if your dog just gets genuinely distracted or something, that's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1721.1s	1721.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1723.1s	1723.1	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1725.1s	1725.1	 No.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1735.1s	1735.1	 Leave it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1746.1s	1746.1	 A common question I get here is, is it OK to reward them with the same treat that you're asking them to leave alone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1751.1s	1751.1	 You don't have to do it. You could reward them with a separate reward as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1754.1s	1754.1	 But I think that dogs are perfectly capable of understanding context and you're allowed to change the rules anytime you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1761.1s	1761.1	 Sometimes it's OK to pick up a treat when you say it's OK and sometimes it's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1771.1s	1771.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1773.1s	1773.1	 Good. I'm avoiding calling his name too much because I'm not quite sure how well he understands that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1779.1s	1779.1	 I'm also not saying come a lot because we haven't really taught that yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1782.1s	1782.1	 But when he came running to me, I was sure to give him a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1785.1s	1785.1	 All right. So I'm satisfied that he's starting to understand the concept of leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1789.1s	1789.1	 Leave it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1794.1s	1794.1	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1806.1s	1806.1	 Trying to get his eyes on me. So it's leave it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1821.1s	1821.1	 Leave it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1845.1s	1845.1	 So he's learning the concept of yes and no through leave it and look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1850.1s	1850.1	 He's doing really well with fetch tug of war is going really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1853.1s	1853.1	 I mean, we're already starting to put the pieces together that are going to be needed to really get them listening in a variety of contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1860.1s	1860.1	 But he's not yet so good with wildlife and birds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1864.1s	1864.1	 That's OK, though. We have a lot of time to work on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1867.1s	1867.1	 I want to think about introducing George to inertia to see if they might be compatible playmates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1871.1s	1871.1	 And there's no doubt he's a powerful dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1873.1s	1873.1	 So I want to make sure that he's comfortable wearing a muzzle before making any introductions just out of an abundance of caution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1879.1s	1879.1	 After all, I've known George less than a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1881.1s	1881.1	 He's actually doing really well with the muzzle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1883.1s	1883.1	 I'm putting some treats through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1885.1s	1885.1	 That's a great thing about basket muzzles like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1889.1s	1889.1	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1890.1s	1890.1	 Look at him sticking his face in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1892.1s	1892.1	 You can see how he's very willingly being tolerant of the muzzle there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1897.1s	1897.1	 So just by putting treats on the outside of that, that gets him comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1900.1s	1900.1	 I'll take it right off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1901.1s	1901.1	 We'll do that a few times and then I'll secure it on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1905.1s	1905.1	 Yes. Good. Love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1908.1s	1908.1	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1912.1s	1912.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1916.1s	1916.1	 How smart are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1919.1s	1919.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1923.1s	1923.1	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1924.1s	1924.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1926.1s	1926.1	 Excellent job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1927.1s	1927.1	 So really, really smart fellow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1929.1s	1929.1	 Let's see if we can secure this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1935.1s	1935.1	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1936.1s	1936.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1937.1s	1937.1	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1938.1s	1938.1	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1940.1s	1940.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1942.1s	1942.1	 And it's worth mentioning with basket muzzles, I have to mention this every time I use them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1946.1s	1946.1	 There's a stigma behind these, but these are among the most humane muzzles that you can use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1951.1s	1951.1	 This is a nice big one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1952.1s	1952.1	 You can see how he can bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1953.1s	1953.1	 He can breathe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1954.1s	1954.1	 He can pant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1955.1s	1955.1	 He can take treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1956.1s	1956.1	 He can drink water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1957.1s	1957.1	 All of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1958.1s	1958.1	 And even if your dog is great with every dog they meet, every dog should learn how to wear this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1962.1s	1962.1	 At some point, it might be necessary for the vet to have to put a muzzle on your dog if they're in some type of pain or having some type of surgery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1969.1s	1969.1	 And that way, if you take the time to get them used to it, they'll be familiar with it at that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1973.1s	1973.1	 And honestly, if I thought he was going to have a negative reaction, I wouldn't even introduce him at all to inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1978.1s	1978.1	 I think he's most likely going to be good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1980.1s	1980.1	 It's really inertia and whether or not she likes this kind of dog who can be a bit playful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1985.1s	1985.1	 So we'll see how they do together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1987.1s	1987.1	 Inertia is a pretty polite greeter, and she sometimes takes exception to other dogs when they come on too strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1992.1s	1992.1	 So I can tell that inertia is a little bit uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=1995.1s	1995.1	 I'm going to go ahead and restrain George to try to show inertia that I'll make sure he's under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2006.1s	2006.1	 Ah, be sweet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2007.1s	2007.1	 That's OK. You don't have to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2009.1s	2009.1	 Good boy. You're responding very well to your ah ah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2015.1s	2015.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2016.1s	2016.1	 I've had two years to get to know inertia at this point, and I'm confident that the most we would see from her in a worst case situation is the type of air nipping that's quite common with border collies and other herding breeds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2028.1s	2028.1	 Because I consistently intervene if I see her feeling uncomfortable, inertia seems to have learned that it's OK for her to express her feelings to other dogs, but that she doesn't need to escalate the situation because I'll always step in to give her a break if she's feeling a little overwhelmed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2042.1s	2042.1	 So far, George is taking those cues pretty well from inertia, but they may need a little bit more time to get to know each other a bit better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2051.1s	2051.1	 By giving them both treats at the same time, I'm able to get them both looking at me for direction in the presence of one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2057.1s	2057.1	 Inertia seems like she wants a little bit of space, so I'm happy to give that to her. And the fact that George isn't pursuing her here is really great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2064.1s	2064.1	 So far, he's been quite good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2068.1s	2068.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2070.1s	2070.1	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2071.1s	2071.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2072.1s	2072.1	 This is a way to get some beginning recall training in right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2076.1s	2076.1	 I love how he's doing well with inertia in the background.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2079.1s	2079.1	 I'm not going to force them to meet or anything like that, but he's being very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2083.1s	2083.1	 He's not overreactive towards inertia at all right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2087.1s	2087.1	 So I really like that about him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2089.1s	2089.1	 He's very good with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2091.1s	2091.1	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2092.1s	2092.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2094.1s	2094.1	 Able to get the look at me in the presence of a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2096.1s	2096.1	 George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2097.1s	2097.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2103.1s	2103.1	 Want to play?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2105.1s	2105.1	 No. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2106.1s	2106.1	 So, I mean, you can see inertia is like, I'm not that into him, but George is just being great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2112.1s	2112.1	 They don't have to play to behave well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2114.1s	2114.1	 So, yeah, inertia is like, I don't really know if I'm into this guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2118.1s	2118.1	 He's a little sus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2119.1s	2119.1	 So she's just trying to avoid him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2121.1s	2121.1	 And that can be OK, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2122.1s	2122.1	 I'm just trying to see how they do together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2124.1s	2124.1	 I want to make sure that inertia doesn't get overly stressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2126.1s	2126.1	 There are some dogs that she loves playing with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2128.1s	2128.1	 You might remember playing with Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2129.1s	2129.1	 She really enjoyed Kona so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2131.1s	2131.1	 I think for now, inertia is content to just watch him and vice versa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2135.1s	2135.1	 Maybe over time, they'll warm up to each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2137.1s	2137.1	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2138.1s	2138.1	 Either one is totally fine with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2139.1s	2139.1	 As long as we get this dog trained, I'll be happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2142.1s	2142.1	 Now, of course, Indy, our 15 year old girl, has to go out for a potty break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2146.1s	2146.1	 I want to see how George reacts to her while we take her out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2149.1s	2149.1	 I have no intention on having Indy and George play together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2152.1s	2152.1	 I think he's going to be a bit much for her, even if he is being relatively calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2155.1s	2155.1	 You know there's a dog in here, right, Indy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2157.1s	2157.1	 Kona, you know, but so many dogs here, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2161.1s	2161.1	 Okay, it's time to give George his first dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2163.1s	2163.1	 Another great way to get your dog comfortable with the muzzle is to feed him through it like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2168.1s	2168.1	 So I'm going to do this just in case I want to use it a little bit more with him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2171.1s	2171.1	 because he's still a little weirded out by the muzzle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2173.1s	2173.1	 But all in all, I'd say he's doing pretty well for this being the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2176.1s	2176.1	 You can see George is very happily putting his face in the muzzle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2180.1s	2180.1	 A little annoyed by the fact that it's harder to get to, but it also slows him down while he eats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2185.1s	2185.1	 which is probably a good idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2188.1s	2188.1	 So I just had George go back into his crate to take a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2192.1s	2192.1	 He's had a really active day so far and it's getting late, at least for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2197.1s	2197.1	 It's like 7 p.m.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2198.1s	2198.1	 Everyone makes fun of me because I go to bed early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2200.1s	2200.1	 Look at him. He has not had a bed that soft in at least four months, maybe never.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2206.1s	2206.1	 And you can just see how much he's enjoying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2209.1s	2209.1	 While he's getting comfortable, I'm going to go ahead and get my bed set up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2212.1s	2212.1	 Hopefully he'll be okay with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2215.1s	2215.1	 So I'm going to inflate this air mattress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2218.1s	2218.1	 And so I'm going to be preemptive and give him some treats here before he begins reacting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2223.1s	2223.1	 You don't want to push a dog to react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2225.1s	2225.1	 So just out of an abundance of caution, we're going to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2229.1s	2229.1	 hey, when crazy motorized stuff like that happens, you get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2234.1s	2234.1	 Okay, you can have one too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2236.1s	2236.1	 Yeah, good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2238.1s	2238.1	 Inertia, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2244.1s	2244.1	 You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2245.1s	2245.1	 Here, it's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2246.1s	2246.1	 He looks at him like a toothbrush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2251.1s	2251.1	 Inertia, it's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2254.1s	2254.1	 You don't want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2256.1s	2256.1	 It's okay. There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2258.1s	2258.1	 He's having a tough time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2260.1s	2260.1	 Well, George seems to do really well with an air mattress being blown up right in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2265.1s	2265.1	 That's good news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2267.1s	2267.1	 I guess we don't need to work on training with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2271.1s	2271.1	 Those eyes. Are you kidding me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2274.1s	2274.1	 I don't know how anyone could love those eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2277.1s	2277.1	 Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2281.1s	2281.1	 So I have played a little bit of fetch with George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2285.1s	2285.1	 He's winded. This is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2287.1s	2287.1	 I'm set up over here for tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2290.1s	2290.1	 I'm going to let him wind down a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2292.1s	2292.1	 I've got him on the tie out so he can stay out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2294.1s	2294.1	 I don't want him spending too much time in the crate, but so far he seems to be doing pretty well in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2298.1s	2298.1	 Hopefully that will continue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2299.1s	2299.1	 I noticed a little while ago as I went upstairs, he did get a little bit of anxiety while in the crate when we walked away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2305.1s	2305.1	 I think he wanted to be with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2307.1s	2307.1	 So as usual, we'll be looking for signs of anxiety throughout the series to see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2312.1s	2312.1	 All right, I'm going to let you outside one more time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2314.1s	2314.1	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2315.1s	2315.1	 All you dogs run into the screen all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2318.1s	2318.1	 Don't do that. You're a smart boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2320.1s	2320.1	 You can do this. Oh, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2322.1s	2322.1	 He's peeing. That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2324.1s	2324.1	 Good work, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2326.1s	2326.1	 The sign acts as a brace so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2334.1s	2334.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2336.1s	2336.1	 Really responds well to a whistle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2338.1s	2338.1	 Hopefully we can keep that going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2340.1s	2340.1	 Notice how scratching his collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2342.1s	2342.1	 Seems to be irritating him a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2344.1s	2344.1	 He's going to have a tag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2346.1s	2346.1	 Wait, don't go in the kitchen. Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2348.1s	2348.1	 He may have never had a collar in his life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2350.1s	2350.1	 There you go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2354.1s	2354.1	 All right, buddy, replace all that pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2356.1s	2356.1	 What would you like to say to our YouTube audience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2360.1s	2360.1	 I don't know. You've done a good job so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2362.1s	2362.1	 Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2368.1s	2368.1	 Yeah, George seems really cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2370.1s	2370.1	 I hope one of you guys adopts him.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2374.1s	2374.1	 Oh, my God.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2386.1s	2386.1	 Oh, geez. That is quick.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2428.1s	2428.1	 Not falling for it yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2430.1s	2430.1	 That's why I like using these sweet potatoes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XxxS7Eh1Ww&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=2749.1s	2749.1	 So many dilemmas. So I'll just do some fetch training out here with him.
