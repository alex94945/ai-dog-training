https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 So Star Trek fans, you're gonna be happy because the next dog coming over here today is named Riker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 I haven't met Riker yet. He appears to be an all-American mutt. Click thumbs up for another video. I hope you're enjoying them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 So I'm here with Riker. I'm just gonna play with him and see how he responds to toys and treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 Speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 Speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=17.4s	17.4	 Yeah, that's good. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=20.9s	20.9	 Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=22.4s	22.4	 That's how you get on my good side quick if you're a dog, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=24.9s	24.9	 If you'll jump into a game of tug that quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 Now I want to see if he'll actually work for play. That'll tell me a lot about how to proceed with this training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=34.5s	34.5	 Yes. Okay, I'll even take that. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=37.1s	37.1	 Good. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=38.1s	38.1	 Come on. It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=39.6s	39.6	 Oh, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=41.7s	41.7	 He's lost interest in tug, it seems. Let's see if we can get him back into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 There it is. Yeah, good. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 Just took you a second to figure it out. All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 He's just over a year old, so I'd say he's doing real good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=52.6s	52.6	 Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=53.6s	53.6	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 Leave it. Wait, wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=62.6s	62.6	 Up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=63.6s	63.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 Go ahead, fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=66.6s	66.6	 No, that's my arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 He's got it in him to work for tug of war, fetch as a currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=71.6s	71.6	 You got to really know your dog's currency before doing much training with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 That's an important part of teaching him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 Let's see how he does for treats now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 Will you sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=80.6s	80.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=81.6s	81.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 Can you lie down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=86.6s	86.6	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 Right there. Go ahead. Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=90.6s	90.6	 We'll let him balance up there. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 Good. Leave it alone. No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 So when he leaves it alone and shows restraint and looks at me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=102.6s	102.6	 I'm going to reward that just about every time right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 because that's a really powerful thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=107.6s	107.6	 Because you can see, I'm going too slow for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=109.6s	109.6	 What are we doing here? You know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=111.6s	111.6	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=119.6s	119.6	 Try and get a little bit longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 Up here. Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=122.6s	122.6	 Yeah, that was awesome. That was really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=124.6s	124.6	 Here, take three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 Now I'm going to try and give it some motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 Setting it down is one thing. Motion is another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 See how he's a lot more likely to jump to it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=136.6s	136.6	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=141.6s	141.6	 Ryker. Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=143.6s	143.6	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 So it's like I'm leaving alone. What do you want? You know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=151.6s	151.6	 But getting that eye contact is so important when he's distracted for the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=155.6s	155.6	 So, you know, it's a minor distraction in a controlled environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 We gradually work up from there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 He's really beautiful in training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 Oh, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 What happens when he experiences the training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 He goes to hide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 Is it when he hears the horn or the vibration or both or?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 Everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 How long after the training is done does it take him to recover?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 A long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 Like more than 10 minutes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=178.6s	178.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=179.6s	179.6	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 Hi, Chris.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 Come here. Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 Go. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=187.6s	187.6	 And sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=188.6s	188.6	 Nice. That was perfect. Will you lie down too?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=192.6s	192.6	 All right, I'll take it. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=193.6s	193.6	 Counter conditioning is protocol in that situation, which is ideally breaking out the chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 If you can get it to him in the early stages or right when you know it's coming,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=203.6s	203.6	 I don't know if the schedule is reliable or if you can kind of hear it in the distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 It's a matter of desensitizing him and creating positive associations around that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 So getting him used to the sounds and also conditioning him that those sounds equal great things for him over an extended period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 The more severe the anxiety, the longer it's going to take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=220.6s	220.6	 All right. Hey, that's a good start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=222.6s	222.6	 Riker, Riker. Will you play tug with this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=225.6s	225.6	 Oh, good. Let go. Yes. Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=231.6s	231.6	 Here, let's do some keep away with Frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 Sometimes by doing this. Yep. There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=239.6s	239.6	 Get some more interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 Yeah, you got a good arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=246.6s	246.6	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=248.6s	248.6	 Nice. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 Nice. Good. See how he's a little more interested now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=253.6s	253.6	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=254.6s	254.6	 But fetch is like an addictive substance to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=257.6s	257.6	 Once they get hooked, they're really addicted to it, but it takes a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=264.6s	264.6	 Is it the hammering that threw him off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=266.6s	266.6	 I heard some hammering in the background.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 I don't know if that was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 Riker. Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=271.6s	271.6	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 What is it, buddy? Are you nervous?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 So we're out here doing some fetch training and playing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=278.6s	278.6	 and I hear some hammering in the background that seems to potentially be throwing him off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=283.6s	283.6	 and making Riker a little bit nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=285.6s	285.6	 If that happens with your dog, if your dog does get nervous,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=287.6s	287.6	 it's important to be patient and understanding with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=290.6s	290.6	 You know, you can't force them to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=291.6s	291.6	 So if they're anxious, it's best to just kind of let them experience it a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=296.6s	296.6	 I'm going to do some counter conditioning with them and see if that helps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=298.6s	298.6	 So I'm just going to give him some treats right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=300.6s	300.6	 The reason for giving him treats in this situation is just to let him know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=304.6s	304.6	 hey, there's still great things out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=306.6s	306.6	 And ideally, the next time I hear someone hammer, if we do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 I think they're putting on a roof around here somewhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=312.6s	312.6	 I'm going to try and rapid fire tiny pieces of this treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=315.6s	315.6	 to see if that kind of helps his mood a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=319.6s	319.6	 He's been doing pretty good here for a minute,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=320.6s	320.6	 so why don't I see if I can get him to go back down here with me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=324.6s	324.6	 and we'll see if we can get him back into the yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=326.6s	326.6	 Come here, Riker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=328.6s	328.6	 Good?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=330.6s	330.6	 And this is what I mean when I say you have to be flexible when you're training dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=334.6s	334.6	 Even though we were doing a fetch training session,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=336.6s	336.6	 if he gets nervous or that anxiety starts arising,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 you have to be able to switch gears and snap into training mode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=341.6s	341.6	 to really address the other issues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=342.6s	342.6	 because some issues are more important to address than others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=345.6s	345.6	 In this case, getting him more comfortable with loud noises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=348.6s	348.6	 and things that really bring up that anxiety level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=350.6s	350.6	 is more important than getting him to play fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=353.6s	353.6	 So those are the kind of calls you have to make when you're raising a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=356.6s	356.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=357.6s	357.6	 Oh, right there, you can hear the hammering, and look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=359.6s	359.6	 Hey, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=360.6s	360.6	 Riker, do you want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=362.6s	362.6	 And look, he's going up against the fence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=363.6s	363.6	 Let me see if I can get him to come over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 That's good. Very good. That's excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=370.6s	370.6	 Yes. Very good. See, it's fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=372.6s	372.6	 Now, if your dog wouldn't take treats in this situation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=375.6s	375.6	 that means the anxiety is probably too high,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=378.6s	378.6	 and you need to probably remove them from the situation that's making them anxious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 and work from there, gradually working up to being able to give them treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=385.6s	385.6	 where they're more comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=386.6s	386.6	 He's now lighting up again, so I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=388.6s	388.6	 So that would indicate, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 Getting him to play, like if I could get him to play around any of those loud noises,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=394.6s	394.6	 that would be even better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=395.6s	395.6	 So his interest is now reignited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 That's very encouraging that we're making progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=401.6s	401.6	 Good, good boy. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=402.6s	402.6	 And there's a fetch, and I'm going to really take advantage of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=405.6s	405.6	 to play a vigorous game of tug of war because he really enjoys that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=408.6s	408.6	 So he brought it back that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=410.6s	410.6	 You don't want to miss opportunities where your dog breaks new ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=414.6s	414.6	 to thoroughly reward them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=417.6s	417.6	 Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=418.6s	418.6	 And also, exercise like this is one of the best ways to reduce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=422.6s	422.6	 virtually all types of anxiety, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=424.6s	424.6	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=428.6s	428.6	 So these are Facebook questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=430.6s	430.6	 Facebook.com slash theseatgeorge, link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=434.6s	434.6	 Katherine asks, I would love to hear about training advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=437.6s	437.6	 regarding dogs who aren't very food motivated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=440.6s	440.6	 OK, yeah, that's a good question because every dog is motivated differently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=444.6s	444.6	 Now, to say that a dog isn't food motivated wouldn't really be accurate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=448.6s	448.6	 I mean, all dogs eat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=450.6s	450.6	 So to say that they're never food motivated isn't accurate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=453.6s	453.6	 But I do know what you mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=454.6s	454.6	 There are some dogs who are less motivated in general to do things for food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=458.6s	458.6	 This is usually an indicator of a couple of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=460.6s	460.6	 Either the dog is just a generally low energy dog and it's kind of like, OK,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=464.6s	464.6	 or it's a sign that you're asking them to do something where they're too overwhelmed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=468.6s	468.6	 or too distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=469.6s	469.6	 Because, for example, I'll hear a lot of people say, my dog's not food motivated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=472.6s	472.6	 because when he sees another dog and he starts barking at him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=474.6s	474.6	 he won't pay attention to me with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=476.6s	476.6	 That's not an indicator that your dog isn't food motivated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=479.6s	479.6	 but rather that just means that you're asking them to do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=482.6s	482.6	 when they're just overwhelmed and distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=485.6s	485.6	 Of course, you would have to take a step back and work up to being able to work with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=488.6s	488.6	 in those distracting scenarios as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=490.6s	490.6	 If possible, getting your dog to work for a toy is always great, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=495.6s	495.6	 Although lower energy dogs aren't as likely to work for a toy, which is fine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=499.6s	499.6	 because we have to accept our dogs for who they are and accept the currencies that work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=503.6s	503.6	 you may also want to consider using a higher quality food reward,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=506.6s	506.6	 something like real chicken, instead of, say, dry dog treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=509.6s	509.6	 Yuig wants to know about what should he do if my dog barks while I'm at work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=515.6s	515.6	 What I'd recommend if your dog barks at work is to extensively exercise them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=519.6s	519.6	 just before going to work so they're less likely to bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=522.6s	522.6	 Put them in an area of the house where they're less likely to bark as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=525.6s	525.6	 You might find that if you put your dog in a bedroom sometimes that they feel cooped up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=530.6s	530.6	 Maybe they're more likely to bark in that situation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=532.6s	532.6	 and maybe they feel more comfortable in the living room, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=535.6s	535.6	 But you know your dog best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=537.6s	537.6	 Secondly, really take advantage of working with your dog on teaching them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=541.6s	541.6	 when it's acceptable and when it's not to bark when you are at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=544.6s	544.6	 You have to go out of your way to set up training scenarios where they're likely to bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=547.6s	547.6	 For example, if you know your dog is likely to bark when you knock on the door,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=573.6s	573.6	 He's got a 12-week-old puppy, and he's only had him for three days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=576.6s	576.6	 With a 12-week-old puppy, it's kind of soon to just get them comfortable with leaving them alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=583.6s	583.6	 because they're still so young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=584.6s	584.6	 So you kind of have to be tolerant of the fact that they're going to be a bit anxious when you leave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=589.6s	589.6	 I would encourage you not to leave a 12-week-old alone too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=592.6s	592.6	 It might be a bit premature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=594.6s	594.6	 But when you do have to leave your dog alone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=596.6s	596.6	 make sure that you freshly exercise him before having to do that to really decrease the anxiety that he has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=602.6s	602.6	 Also, when you are at home, get him used to being alone for short periods of time in the puppy playpen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=607.6s	607.6	 while you go into another room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=608.6s	608.6	 And you'll find that if you do those types of training sessions just after exercise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=611.6s	611.6	 that you're a lot more likely to get rapid results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=621.6s	621.6	 Oh, those are fun. I know.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=627.6s	627.6	 I mean, we have a video coming out with Sarah and her dog, Marble,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=636.6s	636.6	 I agree with you. Dog sports are important.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7guAv-iVVA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=438&pp=iAQB&t=642.6s	642.6	 Good tip. Thank you.
