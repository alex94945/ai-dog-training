https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 That's what we need to go to the next level because until he's really solidly leaving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=166.5s	166.5	 alone something like a treat, we can't expect him to leave alone a car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=169.9s	169.9	 Something he finds very stimulating.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 Maybe they're terrified of the cars or maybe they think the cars are giant play toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 Maybe they're just very curious.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=186.8s	186.8	 I'm back to check in with Denise and Brody today to see how their progress has been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=193.2s	193.2	 Last time I was here, I left you with the homework of teaching the leave it alone, look

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=201.2s	201.2	 He's doing very well with that combo in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=204.1s	204.1	 We've tried it in the backyard as well and he's not quite as consistent in the backyard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 How is he doing with his fetch game?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=211.1s	211.1	 Is he doing that pretty reliably?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 He does that well in the house and we've been working on it outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 Exercise is such an instrumental part of resolving issues that are both relating to hyperactivity

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 Would you agree with that?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=232.2s	232.2	 It's important to focus on progress, not perfection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=234.7s	234.7	 I want to accomplish one main thing today and that is having Brody behave a little bit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 I first want to test to make sure that he's compliant as we approach the door, that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 as we get near the things that normally set him off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=256.9s	256.9	 I also want to make sure that he'll listen to me when we go outside in an outdoor environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=264.9s	264.9	 How did you get that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=265.9s	265.9	 Leave it alone, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 Look at me please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=270.6s	270.6	 That was excellent!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=272.1s	272.1	 That was really awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=273.7s	273.7	 This tells me while I'm very close to the door, I can get his eyes on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=278.2s	278.2	 Check.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=279.2s	279.2	 But what about outside?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 If I just go through the front door right now and start working with Brody, I'm doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=283.1s	283.1	 two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=284.1s	284.1	 I'm changing his environment dramatically and I risk cars passing by setting him off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=288.9s	288.9	 That's two major variables I'd be changing on him at one time and I think that might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=292.5s	292.5	 be too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=293.5s	293.5	 So let's go in the backyard where there are no cars and see how he does there first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=297.4s	297.4	 So I'm going to give him a minute to adjust out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=299.6s	299.6	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=300.6s	300.6	 Ah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=301.6s	301.6	 Brody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=302.6s	302.6	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=303.6s	303.6	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=304.6s	304.6	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=306.6s	306.6	 I'm going to try and get a little bit more eye contact out of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 He's leaving it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=310.5s	310.5	 So he is paying attention to me, but can I get his eyes on me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=317.0s	317.0	 He had his eyes on me for just a moment there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=320.7s	320.7	 Really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=321.7s	321.7	 I'm proud of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=322.7s	322.7	 I can get Brody to look at me, although I can't get him to do it as consistently as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=326.1s	326.1	 I like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=327.1s	327.1	 I think we're at the point where we can at least start to go to the next level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=329.7s	329.7	 At first, right now, what I want to do is just get him kind of comfortable out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=332.8s	332.8	 As cars pass by, I'm not really insisting that he look at me or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 I just want to have him act mildly, acceptably, while kind of far away from the street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 Notice we're only at the patio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 I'm not going to go up to the sidewalk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=344.7s	344.7	 Distance is your friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=345.7s	345.7	 You don't want to just start right up on top of the cars as they pass by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=349.2s	349.2	 He's just looking down the road, waiting for a car to come by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=352.6s	352.6	 Now in order to get Brody's mind off approaching cars and onto me, I decide to take advantage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=356.6s	356.6	 of this setting while there are no cars that have passed by yet and carry over our look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=361.6s	361.6	 at me training in this slightly more distracting setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=364.8s	364.8	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=365.8s	365.8	 Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=366.8s	366.8	 Give me a glance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=367.8s	367.8	 Give it to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=368.8s	368.8	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=369.8s	369.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=370.8s	370.8	 There was a glance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=371.8s	371.8	 That's what I was looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=372.8s	372.8	 I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=373.8s	373.8	 Don't want to throw up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=374.8s	374.8	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 Now see, I'm going to try and distract him with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=376.8s	376.8	 That's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=377.8s	377.8	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=378.8s	378.8	 I'm going to give that treat to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=379.8s	379.8	 Giving the treat to him does a couple of things here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=381.1s	381.1	 It distracts him from the car, but it also starts to create that positive association
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=385.4s	385.4	 that, hey, when a car comes, I'm at least getting something pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=388.8s	388.8	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=389.8s	389.8	 I'm going to give him a treat right as the car passes by before he becomes set off by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=394.2s	394.2	 the car driving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=395.2s	395.2	 Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=396.4s	396.4	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=397.4s	397.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=398.4s	398.4	 Right there, a car passed by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=399.4s	399.4	 He didn't bark, which is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=401.3s	401.3	 That's progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=402.3s	402.3	 You're doing so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=403.3s	403.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=405.3s	405.3	 So we're going to move over here to the grass right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=407.9s	407.9	 See how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=408.9s	408.9	 And really my goal right now is just to get him used to looking at the cars on this busy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=412.3s	412.3	 road over here and kind of the occasional car that passes by here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=415.6s	415.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=416.6s	416.6	 Now there's a car that caught me a little off guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=419.0s	419.0	 Oh, boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=421.0s	421.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=422.0s	422.0	 See?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 I mean, that's going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=424.0s	424.0	 That's why we want to prepare our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=425.0s	425.0	 There's another car moving over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=427.2s	427.2	 As this car approaches, I'm going to give him treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=429.3s	429.3	 I know I see his attentions on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=431.3s	431.3	 Oh, boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=432.3s	432.3	 My bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=433.3s	433.3	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=435.2s	435.2	 Come here and see what he since he's barking there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=438.3s	438.3	 I'm going to go back a little ways here just to create a little bit more distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=441.4s	441.4	 Let's see how this goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=442.4s	442.4	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=443.4s	443.4	 Want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=444.4s	444.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=445.4s	445.4	 He took the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=446.4s	446.4	 Oh, almost.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=448.4s	448.4	 That was a bit much for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=450.4s	450.4	 So right now, what that tells me is if I go much beyond here, I'm going to have a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=454.2s	454.2	 tough time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=469.2s	469.2	 So right now, we're just too close for him, as you can see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=470.2s	470.2	 A big difference from back here on the patio to right here in the front yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMafvtewq94&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=472.3s	472.3	 As you begin to get traction, your progress starts to happen a lot faster.
