https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=47.6s	47.6	 I have to say this is the best tasting dog food I've ever had and I've had a lot of dog food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=53.4s	53.4	 So how does it work? You tell Nom Nom your dog's age, breed, and weight and they'll pre-portion each meal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 Getting a new dog is one of the most exciting things ever but it can also be really overwhelming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=90.3s	90.3	 But there are some universal tips that I've learned over the years that will help you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 So today we're going to go over some of my top tips that I wish someone had told me before I got my first dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=100.2s	100.2	 If you've been keeping up with this series as I've raised and trained Inertia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 you've no doubt seen me implement all of the tips we're going to go over today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=106.8s	106.8	 So if you need those for reference check out our past episodes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 Tip number one and I won't spend a ton of time on this because we cover it a lot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 but manage your dog's environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 From the moment we brought Inertia home I was so careful to manage every inch of real estate she had available to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 I did that by supervising her, making sure she was on leash, and always in a position to be completely safe at all times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 Use a leash to make sure you're able to get to them and watch them all the time when you're able.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 Always keep them in a dog-proofed area when you're not able to supervise them too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=137.1s	137.1	 And you really have to do this for several months with most dogs, which brings us to our next tip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=142.1s	142.1	 And that's preventing bad habits from getting started in the first place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 For example, if you let your dog off leash too early and they get away from you and say they chase a bird or something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 and they don't come to you when you call them, they're learning that listening to come when called isn't necessarily required.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=157.3s	157.3	 Now you guys might remember not too long ago when Bree and I and Inertia took a trip to Corpus Christi,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=162.3s	162.3	 I set up an experiment to show you exactly this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=165.2s	165.2	 Now of course we were in a fence yard, but I wanted to demonstrate that even though Inertia had been reliable on come when called in certain situations before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=173.2s	173.2	 she wasn't necessarily reliable in this new environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 In an ideal world, you wouldn't let your dog have the experience of getting away from you, chewing on your furniture,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=182.4s	182.4	 jumping on guests, or any other bad habit you'd like to prevent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=186.1s	186.1	 So in the case of come when called, keep your dog on a long lead so they're always easy to get to without fail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=192.8s	192.8	 For chewing, always supervise your dog whenever there are around tempting items that you don't want them to chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=198.2s	198.2	 If your dog likes to jump on people, keep them on leash when guests arrive, and preemptively practice sit and stay in the presence of your guests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=205.7s	205.7	 These are the practices you'll have to implement for an extended period of time, several months with a new dog, especially young dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=212.3s	212.3	 So be patient and understand this is completely normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=215.4s	215.4	 Next, keep your expectations realistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 This can be tough at times because we want our dogs potty trained, we want them to stop biting and pulling on the leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 we want them to listen to us all the time, and we want it all now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=227.8s	227.8	 Even today, I have to give this lecture to myself, like, at least once a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=231.8s	231.8	 Inertia's been learning in front of you guys for the past year now, which is an eternity in internet time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=237.8s	237.8	 But in the real world here, I still have a dog who's not even a year and a half old yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=241.9s	241.9	 That's still a young dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=243.5s	243.5	 For a dog to truly understand how to behave in all of the different circumstances that we'll be asking them to behave in throughout their life,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=250.5s	250.5	 you have to give them ample life experience over a good couple of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 So while you can train basic behaviors to your dog pretty quickly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=257.9s	257.9	 getting them to do those behaviors in a variety of different environments, like a crowded city or at a friend's house, can prove very challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=265.1s	265.1	 Make sure you have the mindset for the long game and be prepared to spend the time with your dog in those types of settings to show them how you want them to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 Speaking of which, do you know what throws off new pet parents probably more than anything else?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=278.6s	278.6	 It's how differently their dog behaves in a new setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=281.9s	281.9	 So understanding the importance of your dog's surroundings and their environment is so critical to both of your success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=288.6s	288.6	 Know that things are likely to be much easier for your dog when you train them in the comfort of your own home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 I mean, that makes sense, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=294.9s	294.9	 But don't be surprised when your dog seems to completely not understand a word you're saying when you ask them to do those same things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=301.7s	301.7	 in a place that they're less familiar with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=303.7s	303.7	 You've seen this firsthand with my own dog, Inertia, over the last year of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=307.7s	307.7	 You've also seen that in order to overcome that and get your dog to listen to you anywhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 you've got to practice with them frequently in a variety of different places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=315.8s	315.8	 This next tip can save you a ton of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=318.6s	318.6	 And it's really fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=319.8s	319.8	 Play with your dog often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=321.9s	321.9	 This has made a massive difference with Inertia from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=325.8s	325.8	 If your dog is the kind of dog that really does enjoy play,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 the fastest way to establish a bond between you and your dog is through lots of play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=334.2s	334.2	 Play is the language of so many dogs, especially puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=337.7s	337.7	 Use the power of play to your advantage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=340.0s	340.0	 It's likely to get your dog to pay much better attention to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=342.8s	342.8	 which you can then leverage to train them virtually anything you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=347.1s	347.1	 Natural examples of play that most dogs are born knowing are chase, tug of war,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=352.2s	352.2	 elements of fetch and play wrestling and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=355.2s	355.2	 Dogs love to play all kinds of games with humans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=357.9s	357.9	 You can even make up your own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=359.4s	359.4	 Look for creative ways to engage and play with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=362.4s	362.4	 and watch your training success skyrocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=364.9s	364.9	 Finally, choose your battles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=366.6s	366.6	 I mean, this one can be really counterintuitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=369.3s	369.3	 For example, if you've been following Inertia's lessons,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=371.8s	371.8	 think about some of her first leash training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=374.4s	374.4	 I mean, she would be pulling and sniffing and paying attention to everything but me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 And I know more than a few of you were wondering why on earth is Zach,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=382.9s	382.9	 this professional dog trainer, letting his own dog get away with that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=386.6s	386.6	 But that's because early exposure to new environments like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=389.5s	389.5	 is more important than perfect manners from a young puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=392.4s	392.4	 If you hear nothing else from this video, hear this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=395.4s	395.4	 It's not realistic to train your dog everything at one time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=399.6s	399.6	 And that means you're going to need to be tolerant of things like leash pulling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrDnOj7ZQs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=264&pp=iAQB&t=402.8s	402.8	 and puppy biting for the first many months of training
