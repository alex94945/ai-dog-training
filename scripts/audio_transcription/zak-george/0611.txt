https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=17.3s	17.3	 When teaching a dog to walk without pulling, we often see a complete breakdown in communication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=22.4s	22.4	 and so much frustration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 As a matter of fact, many professional trainers recommend that you do things like use a choke

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=32.4s	32.4	 The only tools you need to teach a dog to do this are your sophisticated human brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=37.3s	37.3	 and a patient attitude.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 First understand why dogs pull on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=41.7s	41.7	 Dogs walk faster than we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=43.6s	43.6	 Very often, the dogs that are pulling on a leash are the very dogs that were bred to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=52.7s	52.7	 dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=53.7s	53.7	 That is the complete opposite of walking slowly next to a person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 Nonetheless, dogs have shown us throughout their history that they're highly adaptable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=62.5s	62.5	 to what we as people teach them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 Do what you can to try and get that initial layer of energy out of them before introducing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 this concept to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=70.2s	70.2	 Dogs are much more receptive to learning once they've gotten rid of some of their energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=74.3s	74.3	 If you have a super high energy dog, you should not be relying on walks as your dog's primary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 form of exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 Consider getting involved with something like dog sports or taking regular long hikes if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 When introducing a concept like this to your dog, it's important to do it indoors in an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=92.5s	92.5	 environment that they're familiar with like your house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=96.1s	96.1	 The last thing we want to say to our dogs is, hey, I'm going to teach you something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 new and I'm going to ask you to do it in the most distracting environment possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 Think about it, when she's pulling, what is she saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 She's saying, I really want to get to there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 So you let her know that's not the way to get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 The first rule is to make sure you're not advancing if there's any tension at all on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 You're fantastic with the eye contact, but on loosely shwalking, you're a bit disconnected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=118.6s	118.6	 from the eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=119.6s	119.6	 This can be achieved by getting their attention with a treat early on, but let me be clear,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=124.1s	124.1	 we're not focused on luring our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=126.7s	126.7	 This is just to get their initial attention on us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 The treat is temporary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=131.5s	131.5	 This way, and this arm will kind of bridge the eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 So this goes from here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=136.6s	136.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=137.6s	137.6	 Interact with them often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 What you've got to improve on is locking your eyes more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 Let them know you love their behavior often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=144.4s	144.4	 If they know sit, ask them to sit often while on a leash, rewarding on sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=149.2s	149.2	 Even if they know sit really well, you should still reward in this instance because you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=153.9s	153.9	 combining it with another behavior, walking on a leash without pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 This makes it more challenging for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=161.1s	161.1	 Acknowledge their success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 Really, this is our student.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 Uh-uh, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 Every time, and that's a normal habit for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 She's a jumper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 So just withhold that reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=168.9s	168.9	 Be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=169.9s	169.9	 If your dog does this during leash training, do your best to ignore it and focus on teaching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 one thing at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=174.8s	174.8	 If you need help with jumping, check the description of this video and I have a fantastic video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=179.7s	179.7	 I think we'll go downstairs and try it in the outdoor environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 Our dogs are not robots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 Quite the opposite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=185.3s	185.3	 They're very smart beings and smart beings are curious and very aware of their surroundings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 We're going to give it a shot outside and see how Nina does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=193.9s	193.9	 Whenever we change environments on a dog and we ask them to do something in an environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=198.1s	198.1	 unfamiliar, we're likely to have relapses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=200.4s	200.4	 So it's important that we take a step back and be patient with them and work with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=204.2s	204.2	 in that new environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=205.3s	205.3	 Don't wait till you have somewhere to be to train this to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 You won't be in a patient mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=209.8s	209.8	 And when you're not patient, progress is unlikely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=212.5s	212.5	 More important than correcting behavior is really acknowledging when our dog is excelling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 Yes!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 I like that she wasn't pulling there, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 I could see she had already gotten in the habit of pulling because the closer we got
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=225.3s	225.3	 to the door, the more she pulled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=227.4s	227.4	 Nina, sweetheart.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 Don't pull me, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=231.6s	231.6	 Let's walk.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 The best time to correct unwanted pulling is right before it occurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 Now, if you know your dog well, you'll know what I'm talking about.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 She's a thinking dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=279.2s	279.2	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=281.2s	281.2	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=285.8s	285.8	 This is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=286.8s	286.8	 Remember, we want to change just a few variables at a time on our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=289.7s	289.7	 We're going to do the same thing we did upstairs, but now it's a new environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 And we're not asking for perfection, but we are asking for improvement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 It is so important to work with our dogs on the things they know in various unfamiliar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=300.8s	300.8	 environments and to do it often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=302.4s	302.4	 That's how we get them to internalize the behavior and really understand it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=305.5s	305.5	 As you're walking and she starts to pull, you take a few feet back right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=308.6s	308.6	 And Jose brings up the obvious dilemma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 We found we weren't able to move anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 Yeah, that's about right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=314.4s	314.4	 That's how it's going to be in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 I mean, you've got to get through that first layer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=318.3s	318.3	 Walking nicely on the leash is baby steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=320.4s	320.4	 You can't build Rome in a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=324.2s	324.2	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=325.8s	325.8	 And see, if I can get two, three steps in with no tension, I'm rewarding that all day long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=329.8s	329.8	 Give them easy stuff to do like sitting and sitting often and reward on sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=333.9s	333.9	 This will keep them motivated and enthusiastic to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=337.4s	337.4	 Yes, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=339.3s	339.3	 Good, this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=340.6s	340.6	 Good, this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=342.3s	342.3	 Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 Hey, Nina, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=346.6s	346.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=348.6s	348.6	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=351.6s	351.6	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=353.4s	353.4	 This is subtle, but observe how Suzy resists the urge to tug on the leash when she changes directions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=359.1s	359.1	 This isn't just about a more humane way to train a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 It's about actually teaching our dogs to think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=364.6s	364.6	 I like how you stuck with her there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=365.9s	365.9	 A lot of people tend to just pull the leash there, but you stuck with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=368.7s	368.7	 When you see that attention is about to slip and they're about to go into pulling mode,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=372.6s	372.6	 insist on getting their attention back on you, again, rewarding them for the behaviors you like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=377.8s	377.8	 Nina, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=379.1s	379.1	 Yeah, there you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=379.7s	379.7	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=380.2s	380.2	 She started to die off and look ahead, but you got her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=383.2s	383.2	 That is perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=384.2s	384.2	 This is interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 A real life distraction presented itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=387.2s	387.2	 Nina, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=388.6s	388.6	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=389.6s	389.6	 Nina, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=391.6s	391.6	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=392.3s	392.3	 Jose does a great job here of saying, I know you hear that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=395.7s	395.7	 So do I.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=396.5s	396.5	 I know what it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=397.3s	397.3	 I know how to proceed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=398.5s	398.5	 Pay attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=399.7s	399.7	 Let's keep going, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=400.9s	400.9	 Again, do this in your own way, but understand that dogs are perfectly capable of understanding these concepts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=407.4s	407.4	 If your dog is so distracted, you may need to get in front of them to block their view in order to get their attention onto you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=414.1s	414.1	 When you feel you have their attention, move out of the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=416.2s	416.2	 Let them look at the distraction, but still communicate to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=419.2s	419.2	 You want them to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=420.6s	420.6	 Now we have a distraction coming, so we're going to try and enforce it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 Stay in real life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=424.0s	424.0	 This is a wonderful opportunity to train in real world conditions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=428.3s	428.3	 She's laying off the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=430.3s	430.3	 That's very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=431.8s	431.8	 Remember, we don't need to be terribly reliant on treats moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=435.6s	435.6	 That's because the environment will eventually serve as the reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=438.9s	438.9	 In other words, your dog gets to enjoy the walk without interruption as long as they're walking without pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=444.2s	444.2	 Let's walk this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=445.1s	445.1	 Walk in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=445.6s	445.6	 And look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=446.0s	446.0	 This is four, five, six, seven, eight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=448.0s	448.0	 I like to count the number of steps I can get in reasonably without pulling occurring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=452.5s	452.5	 Nina, sweetheart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=455.5s	455.5	 This way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=456.7s	456.7	 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=466.6s	466.6	 I mean this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=468.1s	468.1	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=468.9s	468.9	 See that? That's what you love.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=470.1s	470.1	 When she goes, when she's looking up at you, let her know in your own parental way how much you love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=475.6s	475.6	 I'd say we had a pretty successful training session with Nina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=478.6s	478.6	 There's still several weeks of consistency ahead in order for her to really internalize the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=483.8s	483.8	 But she's got two wonderful people who care very deeply about her well-being.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=488.0s	488.0	 And this should be the first consideration when teaching a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=491.2s	491.2	 If you like this video, make sure you click thumbs up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=493.6s	493.6	 My next video is going to be teaching Lexi to stay at the doorway without running into the road.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=498.6s	498.6	 She's a wonderful dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=500.0s	500.0	 But for the video after that, would you rather see Mitzi and Boris learn some fun tricks and basic training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=506.9s	506.9	 Or would you rather see Nina, the dog you saw in this video, learn how to listen to us from a distance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=513.6s	513.6	 Remember, most of your dogs, as you know, will listen to you when you're very up close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=517.6s	517.6	 But if you get farther and farther away, they don't tend to listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=521.0s	521.0	 I'll show you how to do that if you choose that video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBN2_YuTclU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=523.9s	523.9	 OK, guys, we'll see you next time.
