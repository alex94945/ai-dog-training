https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=10.3s	10.3	 Daniel and Lana.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=11.4s	11.4	 This is something they've been working on and I kind of wanted to meet with him personally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 and see if I can help them along the way just to get there to the final product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 I worked with him a few days ago on it and they were getting close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=22.6s	22.6	 You prepared to be cameraman today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 Absolutely, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 You're certainly the best looking cameraman I've ever had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 Well, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 Nothing personal. It's all the cameramen I've had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=35.3s	35.3	 We have no shortage of distractions today. There are birds of every variety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 And somehow we're going to keep our fingers crossed that we can get through this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=43.2s	43.2	 Could there be any more distractions at the park today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 In today's video, I'm going to show you how to teach your dog the back stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 Now the back stall is where your dog stands on your back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=54.2s	54.2	 For many, it's a pretty easy trick to teach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=56.9s	56.9	 Now this is Daniel, by the way. Say hi, Daniel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=58.8s	58.8	 How y'all doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=59.5s	59.5	 And you guys have kind of struggled a little bit with the back stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=62.5s	62.5	 We had a lot of trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=64.5s	64.5	 She's kind of, I got her from the shelter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 so she's always a little skittish toward everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=68.9s	68.9	 And definitely jumping on my back. That was really, really scary for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=73.3s	73.3	 One of the great attributes of trick training is that you can really build your dog's confidence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 Wouldn't you say that that's been?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 Definitely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 Let me go over how to teach your dog how to get started with the back stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=82.9s	82.9	 I think it's kind of valuable to have them jump on something first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=87.1s	87.1	 rather than asking them to jump straight on your back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=89.2s	89.2	 Maybe a chair, maybe a bench.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=90.7s	90.7	 In today's case, we have a rock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=92.7s	92.7	 We see there she's comfortable getting on it. She walked up it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 You can tell she's so happy doing it at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=98.9s	98.9	 That's the thing. If you define these tricks as a chore or a task,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 you're not really going to have a lot of luck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=105.1s	105.1	 But if you keep it fun for your dog, you're going to have a lot of success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 Tell them about your reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=110.4s	110.4	 She's really, really big on tug. That is her favorite game in the entire world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=114.6s	114.6	 You've got to be more interesting than the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=117.1s	117.1	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 Now it's just a matter of transitioning jumping on the rock or the bench or the chair to on your back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=123.7s	123.7	 With this trick, it's so important that when our dogs do jump on our back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 even if they just get two paws or three paws or even four paws,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 is that we let them know that we love them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 Once she got the third one up, and I made a huge deal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=136.1s	136.1	 every time she would throw two up and slowly get the third one up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=141.1s	141.1	 I think that was really, really just getting her the concept of you need three paws up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 And then just move on to four.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 You want to keep your back super straight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=147.8s	147.8	 It might be a good idea to wear a sweatshirt, preferably a Falcon sweatshirt in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=153.4s	153.4	 I'm an Atlanta Falcons fan. He's a diehard New Orleans Saints fan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 And look at you guys. You're making a video together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 Why don't you go ahead and show us here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 You can see Daniel. Perfect. Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=162.9s	162.9	 Look at this. Look at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=164.9s	164.9	 Stay. Stay right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 And look, you can see how she's getting up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 Is this right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 You would reward your dog by giving him a nice little roller there, letting her get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=173.1s	173.1	 Beautiful job, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 Once they're doing that, you're ready to then start to stand up like this a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=178.6s	178.6	 and then have them jump up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=180.2s	180.2	 And don't ask them to stay for too long in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=184.1s	184.1	 But see right there, she didn't do it perfectly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 but you can see he's still rewarding her for trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=189.5s	189.5	 80% of this trick is just getting them to get on your back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=193.3s	193.3	 no matter how clumsy, no matter how awkward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=196.2s	196.2	 After that, it comes pretty easily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=198.9s	198.9	 Right there. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=200.3s	200.3	 Look how she really knows she can trust him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=203.3s	203.3	 She had to find her footing a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=205.3s	205.3	 but that is one of the beauties of teaching a trick like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 The more your dog knows they can trust you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=210.8s	210.8	 the more likely they are to do what you ask them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=213.9s	213.9	 And really, that is what makes a quality relationship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=217.4s	217.4	 I gotta say, that looks pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=218.6s	218.6	 Yeah, you can go ahead and re-warn her if you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=221.8s	221.8	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=222.6s	222.6	 What do you think one of the most important things about trick training is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=225.2s	225.2	 Not only in the back stall, but in your experience with Lana in general?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 I think a lot of it is just building up the relationship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=231.9s	231.9	 The stronger our trust and relationship becomes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=234.3s	234.3	 the easier it is to get her to do more things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=237.3s	237.3	 Especially once you teach a set, then you teach it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=239.8s	239.8	 Then you can go on another trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=240.8s	240.8	 And it seems like the more tricks I teach her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=242.3s	242.3	 the faster she gets the next trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 Even if it's a harder trick, she gets it a lot quicker,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=247.1s	247.1	 just because she understands me and I understand her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=250.2s	250.2	 So I hope you guys teach your dogs how to do the back stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HOa2IUKWR8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=644&pp=iAQB&t=253.2s	253.2	 I'm doing a frisbee giveaway in this video.
