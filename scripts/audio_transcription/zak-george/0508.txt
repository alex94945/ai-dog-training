https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 When you first get a puppy or dog, it's important to get them used to being brushed and touched
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 the moment you bring them home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=30.7s	30.7	 I like to get all of my training supplies from none other than PetFlow, of course.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=36.5s	36.5	 PetFlow specializes in having your dog food or cat food for that matter

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 You just choose your favorite brand of food and how often you want it to be delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 It really is that simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=48.2s	48.2	 I'm going to have a special link and a coupon code in the description of this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 that will give you 20% off of your first auto ship order.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=60.2s	60.2	 This is why I like getting my stuff from PetFlow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=62.8s	62.8	 They are committed to making sure that you're totally satisfied with their service.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=65.9s	65.9	 The reason you want to get your dog used to being touched firmly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=68.4s	68.4	 especially if you happen to have a puppy, is because we want to desensitize them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=72.4s	72.4	 We don't want it to be a special occasion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=74.3s	74.3	 So, for example, if one day a child or a stranger comes up to your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 and catches them a little bit off guard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 we want to be reasonably assured that our dog is going to react well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=83.4s	83.4	 Start slowly. It's a good idea to use some treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 I'm using tiny pieces of real turkey meat today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=90.2s	90.2	 If I didn't have the treats and I was doing this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 there's a good chance he might be all over the place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 I'll give him a piece of meat right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 Then I'll start to touch his neck a little bit right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=100.6s	100.6	 And I'm doing more than just petting him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 And you can see he's reacting really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 Now I'm going to touch his feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 Many dogs have very sensitive feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 You want to rub their nose and their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=109.7s	109.7	 Don't be afraid to get up in there and their gums too a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=112.8s	112.8	 just to get him used to being touched.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 It'll also make vet visits a little more bearable for your puppy too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 And he was a little resistant there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 So I want to just take a step back and try and keep him at ease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 I mean, you can't blame him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=124.6s	124.6	 You're going into his mouth and touching those little tiny teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 We're going to open his mouth, touch his tongue a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 It's really helpful too to put him on their back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 Just get him used to really being comfortable with you in all sorts of positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 It's a really good trust-building exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=140.4s	140.4	 But he's a little squirmy here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=141.8s	141.8	 So I'm going to give him some treats here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 I'm not having to hold him down at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=145.5s	145.5	 The idea here is to have him be really comfortable while on his back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=149.1s	149.1	 You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=149.7s	149.7	 I'm going to touch his little fat belly over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 His little pug paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 I'm just kind of letting him nibble on this tiny piece of turkey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 while I massage his feet a little bit just to get him really, really used to being touched.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 I'm going to touch his nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=164.9s	164.9	 I know you got a nose in there somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 Where is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=168.5s	168.5	 And right now you can see he's totally relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 He's just hanging out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=172.1s	172.1	 So let's see if we can take this to the next level and get Mojo comfortable with being brushed now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=176.3s	176.3	 Like everything in dog training, you want to make the grooming process as enjoyable to your dog as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=182.3s	182.3	 The idea with getting your dog comfortable with being brushed is to not push them to the point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=186.2s	186.2	 where they just hate it right off the bat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 You want to keep them from getting in that position to begin with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=190.9s	190.9	 And the methods that I'm about to use to get Mojo comfortable with being brushed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=194.4s	194.4	 are the same methods that you would use in order to get your dog comfortable with having their teeth brushed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 their ears cleaned, or their nails trimmed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=200.7s	200.7	 The first thing we want to do is start slowly by introducing the brush to our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 I'm not even going to touch Mojo with the brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=206.9s	206.9	 Look at this. I'm going to let him see it right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=209.9s	209.9	 And then I'm going to give him a nibble of this handful of turkey I've got right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=213.9s	213.9	 I'm going to let him investigate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=215.5s	215.5	 He's all into that brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 We're going to give him a treat for reacting in a relatively good way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=220.3s	220.3	 At least he wasn't scared of the brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=222.5s	222.5	 I really like to start by easing a dog into the process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=224.8s	224.8	 So I'm just going to touch him with it like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=227.6s	227.6	 He reacted well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=228.7s	228.7	 I'm going to give him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=229.9s	229.9	 Just like that. See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=231.9s	231.9	 And look, he's reacting really well while I do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=234.3s	234.3	 Just tapping him lightly with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=236.2s	236.2	 I'm using the treats here just so he's really comfortable and has this great association with this brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=241.3s	241.3	 Now comes the moment of truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=242.9s	242.9	 I'm going to attempt to do my first brush stroke with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=246.3s	246.3	 And hopefully he reacts well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=248.7s	248.7	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 Good job. I'm going to give him some turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=251.8s	251.8	 You couldn't ask for better than this on the first attempt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 This is a soft brush that I'm using, but you notice if I turn it over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=257.2s	257.2	 it has a completely different texture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=259.1s	259.1	 So this is a major variable change to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=261.5s	261.5	 Just because he reacted well to one brush doesn't mean I'm assured that he's going to react the same to another type of brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=267.3s	267.3	 Now let's see what happens if he doesn't nibble on the treat and I just touch him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=270.5s	270.5	 So here we go. Touch. Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=274.2s	274.2	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=274.9s	274.9	 He's doing so well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 Look at that. Now I'm going to give him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=280.7s	280.7	 So now he's just being really tolerant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=284.1s	284.1	 Brush him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=285.9s	285.9	 Give him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 Yes! Brush him. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=289.5s	289.5	 See, you can see right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=290.6s	290.6	 He looked at the brush, but he was so interested in the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 He's already been a bit desensitized to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=295.7s	295.7	 Slicker brushes are a really common brush to use for dogs that shed a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=299.4s	299.4	 And they can be a little bit abrasive to a dog if they're not used to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=303.0s	303.0	 So again, you want to go nice and slow at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=306.8s	306.8	 Just getting him comfortable. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=308.9s	308.9	 Oh, you're so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=310.5s	310.5	 Right now I'm not focused on a proper groom with Mojo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 I'm just focused on getting him comfortable with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=316.3s	316.3	 And that preparation is really what will make all the difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 And right now I'm not even having to treat him. You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=322.3s	322.3	 So I didn't put him in a position to hate being brushed to begin with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=325.3s	325.3	 to only then go back and try to fix it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=327.7s	327.7	 However, if you are in that position with your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=330.8s	330.8	 it's totally fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIarnAg2HT8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=509&pp=iAQB&t=331.8s	331.8	 Take a step back. Reintroduce it in the way that we've done here.
