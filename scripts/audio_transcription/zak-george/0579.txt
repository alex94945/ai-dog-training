https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 Today's topic is a pretty interesting one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 As a positive trainer, I'm often asked about how I feel about using the word know when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=56.6s	56.6	 teaching a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 I do use the word know when teaching a dog, but a lot of other trainers feel that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 shouldn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=64.1s	64.1	 So in this video, I kind of want to explain what the logic is behind both strategies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=70.4s	70.4	 So what is the big controversy when telling your dog know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=74.2s	74.2	 Well, some professional trainers think that if you tell your dog know that you as a beginner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 are more likely to do so in a frustrated or angry manner, and there is some validity to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 this for some people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 Remember, there can be no progress when you and or your dog are in a frustrated mindset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=90.4s	90.4	 during the learning or teaching process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=92.8s	92.8	 Furthermore, if a dog is told know time after time, that's likely to discourage them just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=98.4s	98.4	 like it would be for a person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=99.9s	99.9	 I mean, wouldn't you feel discouraged if you felt like you weren't getting anywhere?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 Maybe a dog might have a bad association with the word know, maybe from a past home, maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=108.3s	108.3	 they were abused, maybe they were with someone who is very heavy handed when training them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=114.6s	114.6	 or maybe they're just a very sensitive dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=116.8s	116.8	 So any escalation in the volume of your voice may make them more sensitive and likely to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=121.4s	121.4	 shut down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=122.6s	122.6	 So there are a whole host of reasons to avoid the word know with many dogs, because if we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=127.4s	127.4	 are able to accurately correlate the word know with an unpleasant or stressful reaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=132.7s	132.7	 from our dog, then we need to avoid doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=135.1s	135.1	 For this reason, many trainers adopt the policy of never using the word know with a dog, waiting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=140.4s	140.4	 for the dog to eventually stumble upon the right behavior or to perform the right behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 with a little bit of coaching from the trainer, at which time the trainer will say yes and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=148.2s	148.2	 follow it up with a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=150.1s	150.1	 So I hear you asking right now, Zach, why do you use the word know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 You know, I feel that yes and no need to mean something to our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 Yes should equal something very good for our dog getting the thing that they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 And no should simply be a way of communicating to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=166.1s	166.1	 No, that's not what I'm looking for right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=168.9s	168.9	 And we simply withhold the treat or the toy or keep the walk from continuing, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 No should never mean bad dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=175.9s	175.9	 I'm mad at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 Never do that again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 No should only serve to communicate to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=181.8s	181.8	 That's not what I'm looking for right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=184.2s	184.2	 Let's try something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 And I find that as long as I've done a sufficient job of teaching my dog what the word know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 means, that they will eventually know that they can stop doing what they're doing and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=195.9s	195.9	 try something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=197.4s	197.4	 So that allows me to get a little bit more time out of my training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=200.2s	200.2	 My style of teaching is to approach teaching a dog like I would a young child.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=204.4s	204.4	 Remember, dogs, more than any other species on earth, were bred to interact with and communicate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=210.1s	210.1	 with people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=211.1s	211.1	 Nobody denies this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=212.4s	212.4	 And we as people intuitively already know how to teach a young child.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 That's why this is such a wonderful combination of two species that can learn and communicate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=221.9s	221.9	 with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=223.2s	223.2	 I find yes and no to be a very natural way to communicate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=226.7s	226.7	 And I'm obviously not one for passive communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 I think it's very important to give our dogs very frequent feedback often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=233.2s	233.2	 Now of course, the emphasis of our training should always be on yes, always letting our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=237.4s	237.4	 dog know what we love.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=239.2s	239.2	 And when we do have to tell them no, that should always be done in a very neutral way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=243.9s	243.9	 I think about it like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=245.2s	245.2	 If I were in a situation where I had to live with somebody long term and neither one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=249.4s	249.4	 us spoke one another's language, the first two concepts that we would want to establish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=254.2s	254.2	 would be yes and no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=255.9s	255.9	 Now here's something to keep in mind as you're teaching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 For example, if I found myself saying no too many times in a row, that would be my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=262.8s	262.8	 cue that I'm probably asking too much of my dog and I need to take a step back on my training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 So my protocol is basically to get down on the ground and go back and work on something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=272.8s	272.8	 easy like sit or lie down or the last thing that they really mastered to kind of reset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=277.5s	277.5	 them and re-motivate them and get them interested in learning again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=281.5s	281.5	 You know, all of the good dog trainers out there will take a step back on their training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=286.6s	286.6	 without hesitation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=288.4s	288.4	 So you've got to get over this notion of, well, my dog showed me that he did it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=291.8s	291.8	 he's not doing it, so I guess he's justifying me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=294.4s	294.4	 No, you've got to take the attitude that you're willing to work with your dog through these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=298.2s	298.2	 concepts because they may understand it one day and they may forget it the next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=301.9s	301.9	 So sometimes they need a little bit of a reminder, be understanding of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=305.8s	305.8	 If you were building a structure like a building, for example, it would be kind of silly to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=309.2s	309.2	 continue to build on that foundation if you knew there was a weakness there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 Get your foundation strong by getting your communication strong and by teaching our dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=318.4s	318.4	 the concept of the word no, we're more likely to strengthen overall communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=323.7s	323.7	 At the end of the day, there's nothing wrong with saying the word no to your dog as long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=327.2s	327.2	 as they're not feeling discouraged and there's nothing wrong with choosing to avoid the word
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=331.4s	331.4	 no either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 It really comes down to personal preference and what you as a trainer are comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=336.7s	336.7	 with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=337.7s	337.7	 It's important that you don't feel mechanical as you continue to learn how to teach your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=341.8s	341.8	 dog and dogs really respond super well to a genuinely optimistic person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=347.4s	347.4	 The broader your communication is with your dog, the more likely they are to understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=351.2s	351.2	 various concepts like yes or no and this in turn will likely accelerate your training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prUQqIlBjzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=580&pp=iAQB&t=356.0s	356.0	 because you have a common language.
