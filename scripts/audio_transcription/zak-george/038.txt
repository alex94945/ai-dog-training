https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=4.5s	4.5	 That is old school thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=6.4s	6.4	 That's the problem is we are willing to get a dog in a physical position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 regardless of what's going on up here in their mind and how they feel emotionally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=14.5s	14.5	 If we manage their emotions first, getting them into said physical positions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 or to do tricks or catch frisbees or come when called and stay, walk on a leash nicely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 all of that comes much easier when your dog is in an optimistic frame of mind as it would you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 Dogs and humans are not as different as many will have you believe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=32.6s	32.6	 While they are a different species, we are both mammals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=35.3s	35.3	 Our brains behave similarly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=37.2s	37.2	 There's a lot of interesting data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 Even at the neuronal level, we understand how dogs learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 It just happens that being kind to our dogs is more effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=47.3s	47.3	 You don't have to do it out of obligation, but you will get better results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYVIHPfMtSM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=39&pp=iAQB&t=50.9s	50.9	 At least that is what the evidence suggests.
