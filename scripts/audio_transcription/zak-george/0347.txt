https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Have you ever wondered why people don't make their life easier when it's really easy to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=3.5s	3.5	 I think it's time for a shave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 I got my shaving cream, I've got a really good modern razor.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=11.7s	11.7	 Now it's time to go somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=13.3s	13.3	 Alright, now how do I get to that place I was gonna go to?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=62.3s	62.3	 Regardless of your dog's age, you're going to want to teach them boundaries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 And we're going to work on some basic puppy boundary training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=68.7s	68.7	 He's a little young for this, but I think we can make a lot of progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 The thing about boundary training is sometimes it means a room is always off limits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=75.5s	75.5	 or sometimes it can mean a room is sometimes off limits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 And dogs are perfectly capable of understanding the difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=82.2s	82.2	 Don't feel like you're going to confuse them if sometimes you don't want them in the kitchen while you're cooking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 but other times it's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=87.6s	87.6	 So you might notice I've got this piece of tape right here in the middle of the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=90.5s	90.5	 Now my goal is to show Rochaux how to stay on one side of the tape while I'm on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 Rochaux doesn't like the idea of boundary training and he's literally breaking the boundaries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 Rochaux understands a basic stay for duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=106.5s	106.5	 We're just going to get him a little warmed up and we're going to work on stay with distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 So stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 Yes, I just took a step away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=113.6s	113.6	 I love that he hasn't crossed this line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 That's great that his stay with distance is working well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=118.3s	118.3	 but you know, this isn't really how you deal with boundary training in real life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 This is a prerequisite to training your dog how to stay in a specific area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 So let's do something a bit more realistic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=128.1s	128.1	 I'm now walking suddenly putting him into a stay and then continuing on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=132.4s	132.4	 That's unusual for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 See how he has a tendency to do that when he was listening to stay so well under other circumstances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 So let's work on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 We're going to walk up to the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=140.6s	140.6	 I'm going to say sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=142.3s	142.3	 Oh, no, you crossed the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=144.9s	144.9	 Now if your dog weren't across the line like that, just simply redirect them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=148.9s	148.9	 Put him back into a sit stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=150.1s	150.1	 I'm going to break it down and make it a little bit easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=152.1s	152.1	 So we'll walk up sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 You see there what I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=157.8s	157.8	 I took a half a step like I was going to continue on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=160.3s	160.3	 You have to really spell it out for your dog when they're young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 Stay going past the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=165.1s	165.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=166.1s	166.1	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=171.8s	171.8	 So right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=172.5s	172.5	 That's our first moment of success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=174.1s	174.1	 I was able to walk up to the line, drop the leash, say stay and walk past the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=178.6s	178.6	 The reason this is significant is because normally when you're teaching stay to your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 you're in this real setup training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 That's not real life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=186.3s	186.3	 That's a good way to introduce the concept of stay because there are going to be times I'm telling you in real life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 where you just for whatever reason want your dog to stay while you walk ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=194.1s	194.1	 You know, maybe you're in public and you want to go greet someone and shake their hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=197.6s	197.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=198.4s	198.4	 Hello, I'm Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=199.3s	199.3	 It's nice to meet you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=201.4s	201.4	 Teaching them how to stay at a boundary is really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=204.2s	204.2	 Now this tape here isn't so much for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 It's for me just to give you a visual of what we're trying to accomplish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=209.3s	209.3	 And so you don't have to limit yourself to these basic exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=212.2s	212.2	 Do things like this in public often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=214.2s	214.2	 Once again, the motion is over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=216.3s	216.3	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=217.7s	217.7	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=218.3s	218.3	 Walking away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 See, I was able to walk away, turn my back and that's much different than your basic training exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 So that's wonderful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=225.5s	225.5	 Once your dog starts to understand this basic concept of stay and they're starting to stay in a variety of different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=230.8s	230.8	 circumstances, then you're ready to probably teach a more advanced stay something like settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Now settle basically is where you say, okay, lie down, chill out and await further direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 Whereas stay is more short term where you indicate to your dog, okay, I'm about to release you from that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=245.8s	245.8	 and you can come over here or we can get back to interacting with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 You might be wondering, well, what does settle have to do with teaching your dog boundaries?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 It's a lot easier to teach your dog boundaries when you can give them something else to do like go lay in your bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 and just relax for a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=258.3s	258.3	 Now the concept of teaching your dog how to relax on cues certainly takes some maturity on your dog's part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=263.1s	263.1	 and it does take some time to teach, but it's never too soon to get started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=267.1s	267.1	 It usually takes, you know, several weeks to a couple of months to really instill a basic settle with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 But let me show you what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 You might notice I put them into a down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=275.2s	275.2	 So a prerequisite is that your dog knows how to lie down when you ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 Down and stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 That's up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 Down, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=285.2s	285.2	 I don't know if he knows a down state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=286.5s	286.5	 It appears that he doesn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=287.6s	287.6	 Since he's struggling with holding that down stay, I'm going to spend some time over here with him at a closer distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=292.3s	292.3	 That's likely to encourage him to hold the down stay a bit longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=295.5s	295.5	 Oh, it looks like he's about to relax those hips over there, which which would indicate a more relaxed down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=301.1s	301.1	 I'm actually going to reward the hip shift over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=304.0s	304.0	 I'm even using a quieter tone of voice because I'm just trying to encourage him to be relaxed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=307.9s	307.9	 and I'm trying to reward less frequently over here just to get him to relax and check out while he assumes that down relaxed stay position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=315.4s	315.4	 A good time to teach your dog to settle is maybe you've got friends or family over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=319.2s	319.2	 you're having coffee and your dog's kind of relaxed naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=322.3s	322.3	 This is a good time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 Maybe every 30 seconds every minute go up to him and say good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=326.4s	326.4	 I like that you're settling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=327.3s	327.3	 You can give him a treat or you can just give them some reassurance and say hey settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=331.4s	331.4	 I'm only going to reward on the relaxed hips this time rather than that sphinx like lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=336.4s	336.4	 Settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=337.3s	337.3	 And you can see they're lying on his side there a good bit more relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=343.3s	343.3	 Leave the boundary line alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=345.1s	345.1	 And see this is what a settle looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=346.9s	346.9	 You can see how this is different than a more formal stay where they're sitting and looking at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=351.2s	351.2	 He's slowly becoming more and more relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=353.5s	353.5	 As long as he's not getting up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=354.7s	354.7	 I'm going to continue to reward every several seconds here and you still don't just want to assume they're going to hold it forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=359.7s	359.7	 You need to get in there and reward them from time to time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=362.4s	362.4	 This is the power of settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=364.3s	364.3	 I mean look at him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=365.0s	365.0	 He's practically falling asleep right now and by really taking the time to communicate to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=370.2s	370.2	 This is what down and relax means then you can eventually get them to do it on cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=375.1s	375.1	 Wouldn't that be amazing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=376.3s	376.3	 But it is worth mentioning that if you do have a higher energy dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=379.4s	379.4	 it's not reasonable to insist that they settle unless you give them regular exercise usually in the form of fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=385.9s	385.9	 Ultimately, you'll be able to tell your dog look go settle down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVrKIvTlR60&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 I'm going to go enjoy my company over here or I'm going to watch my football game.
