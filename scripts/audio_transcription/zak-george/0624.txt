https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Does your dog listen to you in unfamiliar environments?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=8.7s	8.7	 Let me know in the comments below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=10.5s	10.5	 Dogs are really sensitive to environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=12.7s	12.7	 The best way to get your dog comfortable in a new environment is to get there early and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=16.9s	16.9	 let them adjust before asking them to do stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=19.6s	19.6	 I know that I like to get to work very early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=22.3s	22.3	 Being early for me has always helped me prepare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=24.8s	24.8	 I think it's important to get used to an environment even for people, not just dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=29.2s	29.2	 New environments focus on progress, not perfection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 Jax is a fairly low-key doberman and we're working on building his attention span and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=38.9s	38.9	 his focus by teaching him to stay while we walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 I'm coming right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 If you ever find that you're struggling with this, it's probably because you're asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=48.7s	48.7	 for too much too early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=50.8s	50.8	 Don't feel like you need to get a 10-yard stay for five minutes at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=54.3s	54.3	 So it's stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=56.8s	56.8	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 And I'm coming right back over here to treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=59.1s	59.1	 It takes weeks to months to get a really good stay with distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 It's important to be consistent, but above all, be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 Not just about having them perform a boring stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 Engage them, make sure they're happy, they're enjoying everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 If you're doing stay with distance, we're walking away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=75.2s	75.2	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=76.2s	76.2	 And then we're going to come back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 So she's saying stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 See that fast pace?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=80.1s	80.1	 When you can get into that rhythm with your dog, you've got momentum on your side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=83.4s	83.4	 That's how you build distance in a hurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=85.2s	85.2	 So don't be too mechanical about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=87.3s	87.3	 Whenever you can infuse your training with feeling, you'll find that your dog is probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=92.1s	92.1	 more receptive to training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=93.6s	93.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 You see this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=95.6s	95.6	 This energy, this rhythm right here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 And do your own version of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=101.4s	101.4	 This energy really counts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=102.4s	102.4	 They pick up on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 Pipples of wonderful dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=104.8s	104.8	 So Jax, being a dog, likes to sniff the ground, explore his environment, and there are times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 when we should encourage this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=110.4s	110.4	 But there are also times when our dog needs to be focused on us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=113.9s	113.9	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=114.9s	114.9	 This way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=115.9s	115.9	 Uh-uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 Yes, I saw the sit coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 So I clicked a little premature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=124.8s	124.8	 And so far there's been no tension.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=126.3s	126.3	 And if there was tension, we were going into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=128.4s	128.4	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 Look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 And see, look at that line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 That was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=132.4s	132.4	 These are great dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 So a lot of you have definitely dealt with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 Your dog is pretty good on a leash until they encounter another dog coming towards them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=141.9s	141.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=143.9s	143.9	 You see the dogs coming before they get there most of the time, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=147.4s	147.4	 Anticipate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 Always be one step ahead of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 Since you know that that pulling is likely to come, you've got to get in his head before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 you get to those dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=156.4s	156.4	 Ideally, we want to immediately remove our dog from the stressful or exciting situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 that's making them go crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 We want to search for the last place where they were behaving acceptably and try and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 gain traction there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 If he does start pulling, you're turning around going the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 I will remove you from what you want to go after right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=173.6s	173.6	 But it's a normal behavior for a young dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=176.1s	176.1	 There is no path to having a well-trained dog that doesn't require us to take a step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 back from time to time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 Remember, today's question is, does your dog listen to you in unfamiliar environments?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMc9NJPmDWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=625&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 Let me know in the comments below.
