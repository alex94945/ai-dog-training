https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Good leash walking skills can be one of the toughest things to train a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=3.4s	3.4	 Today we'll see where inertia is on this critical skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=7.9s	7.9	 I train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 This is my new dog and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 You can start from the beginning or you can pick up anywhere.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=24.8s	24.8	 your results will forever remain in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=27.6s	27.6	 This is inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 We're in Alaska.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 We're traveling right now and I was looking through my comments recently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 and one of the most common things that you guys ask about is dog food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 Which foods are good?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 Look, there's a lot of really good dog foods on the market,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=47.1s	47.1	 but I always recommend that people feed their dog a super premium food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 And if your dog's food is good enough, you can even use it as a currency to train them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=56.1s	56.1	 Make sure that you feel okay and comfortable with the ingredients in your dog's food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 Solid Gold is a perfect example of a top-notch dog food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 For example, in this food, there's a variety of different protein sources
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=66.6s	66.6	 like lamb and ocean whitefish, which is great for healthy omega fatty acids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Plus, there are 20 super foods in this one bag of dog food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=74.6s	74.6	 Things like kelp, blueberries, and broccoli.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=77.5s	77.5	 I just wish that I had the discipline to eat this healthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=81.1s	81.1	 And Nersha, maybe you and I should be on the same diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=83.7s	83.7	 Solid Gold makes a variety of high-quality foods like this and some awesome supplements too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=88.4s	88.4	 like human-grade bone broth and sea meal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=99.3s	99.3	 There are few things that are more important and more challenging to train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 than teaching a dog to walk nicely with a loose leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 Many of you have been keeping up with our journey on this so far,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=109.6s	109.6	 and inertia has shown fantastic improvement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=112.3s	112.3	 But we are so overdue for an update on how she's doing with her neighborhood walking skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=118.1s	118.1	 So that's what we're going to do today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=120.4s	120.4	 Since we are in a brand new neighborhood that inertia has never been to before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=123.9s	123.9	 I've exercised her with a little bit of fetch before this lesson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=126.9s	126.9	 to help get some of that excess energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 If you're having issues with training your leash walking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=132.1s	132.1	 ask yourself if you're exercising your dog before their leash training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 That in and of itself can help relieve your dog's frustration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 from not being able to walk everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=141.6s	141.6	 If inertia had her way, she would like to go up to that front door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=144.9s	144.9	 or sniff that yard over there or maybe go find a squirrel or a dog to play with, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 So staying right by my side and walking extra slowly are pretty low down on the list
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=155.6s	155.6	 of things that inertia wants to do right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 Even though I've exercised her, since this is a brand new neighborhood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=161.1s	161.1	 that she's never been to before, for the beginning part of our walk right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=164.3s	164.3	 I'm going to give her a little bit of space to explore and tolerate some pulling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=168.1s	168.1	 while she takes in her new surroundings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=170.2s	170.2	 I really want to be empathetic to the fact that she's a curious dog, as most dogs are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=174.9s	174.9	 and this is a challenging thing for her to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=176.9s	176.9	 The whole reason that leash walking is such a particularly challenging thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 for many of us to teach our dogs is that dogs do walk much faster than we do naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 So we have to really teach them to slow down their pace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=188.3s	188.3	 and walk with us as we go down the street while tethered to a six-foot leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=192.7s	192.7	 Traditionally, you guys have heard me talk about the two main types of walks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=195.9s	195.9	 You have training walks and then you have regular walks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=198.9s	198.9	 A training walk is where you are just focusing on teaching the fundamentals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=202.7s	202.7	 Maybe you're just in front of your house, for example, working on basic training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 In other words, you don't really have a destination in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=209.3s	209.3	 You're just focused on training your dog to walk nicely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=212.2s	212.2	 check in with you, and change directions when you change directions, and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=216.3s	216.3	 During training walks, it is important just to verify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 that your dog can perform well in short bursts in relatively familiar places,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=223.7s	223.7	 before you start asking them to listen in more challenging places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=227.1s	227.1	 Now, a normal walk is probably what you think of when you think about taking a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=230.3s	230.3	 You're actually trying to get somewhere, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 These days, Inertia and I are focused more on a hybrid walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=236.2s	236.2	 In other words, I'll let her explore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=238.2s	238.2	 I'll tolerate some minor pulling here and there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=240.7s	240.7	 but I'll also sprinkle in some training sessions there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=243.7s	243.7	 and insist on better and better leash manners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=246.1s	246.1	 I mean, like everything in dog training, polite leash walking is phased in over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 You don't just go from an unruly dog to a perfect dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 There's a lot of intermittent steps in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 Now, if you're looking for a really detailed written guide to all of my leash walking advice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=262.7s	262.7	 check out my book, Guide to a Well Behaved Dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=264.9s	264.9	 I'm going to have that in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=266.4s	266.4	 So these days, I'm really focused on getting Inertia's attention on me whenever I ask for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=271.9s	271.9	 Inertia!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=275.1s	275.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=275.7s	275.7	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=278.1s	278.1	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=279.1s	279.1	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=279.8s	279.8	 So that's evidence right there that I can get Inertia's attention on me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=283.8s	283.8	 which I do test for periodically asking her to do basic things like sit or lie down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=289.5s	289.5	 or ignore that airplane that's really loud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=291.8s	291.8	 But since this is a hybrid walk, part training and part leisure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=295.1s	295.1	 I don't want to overdo this, you know, asking for her attention all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 I still want her to be able to tune out and sniff the wind or the ground or the grass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=303.4s	303.4	 or whatever and just be a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 It's important to walk this line and it can definitely be easier said than done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=309.2s	309.2	 Now, I'm still using treats in our training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=311.6s	311.6	 but that's not the only currency I'm using to reward her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=314.8s	314.8	 In other words, you can see right now she's into treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=317.8s	317.8	 She's into her environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=319.4s	319.4	 And so I can use both of those things to really reinforce desired behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 When she's behaving well, we just keep on walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 If she starts to get a little unruly or starts to pull, I can simply stop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=330.1s	330.1	 work on doing something like lie down, you know, and finding something easy to reward her for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=336.7s	336.7	 So it's really important to ask yourself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 what is the most powerful currency that you can use in that particular moment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=343.6s	343.6	 So throughout her walk, her interest shifts from treats to simply being able to explore on the walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=348.6s	348.6	 So use both of those to your advantage during leash training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=351.3s	351.3	 You might also want to consider using a toy as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=353.9s	353.9	 If your dog likes to play tug of war or something like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=356.6s	356.6	 simply making your dog act a certain way through physical punishment or force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=360.8s	360.8	 is unlikely to deliver long term results without significant side effects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=365.2s	365.2	 So I'm fine using treats at this point in our training for leash walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=369.2s	369.2	 And you should be too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=370.3s	370.3	 I mean, really, if you're focused on training an intricate concept,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=373.1s	373.1	 like leash walking to your dog, you can't rush through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=375.6s	375.6	 It can really take a lot of time for a dog to adapt to walking at our slower human pace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=381.4s	381.4	 in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=382.5s	382.5	 And I love how she's walking right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=384.3s	384.3	 She's checking in with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=385.3s	385.3	 If she checks in with me again, just like that, I'm going to go ahead and offer her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=389.8s	389.8	 Those are what you really look for where your dog is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=391.7s	391.7	 hey, I think this means I get good stuff sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=394.6s	394.6	 I'm happy to also let her go and take a sniff of the grass over here for a second and check it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=399.9s	399.9	 All right, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=400.8s	400.8	 And look, did you see that automatic check in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=403.0s	403.0	 Yes, I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=404.9s	404.9	 Again, I want her to enjoy the walk, not just be constantly focused on me and looking at me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=409.8s	409.8	 you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=410.6s	410.6	 Walks are fun for all of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=416.2s	416.2	 Do you hear that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=418.7s	418.7	 Do you hear that distraction right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=419.9s	419.9	 It's really got her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=421.0s	421.0	 It's a new animal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=421.8s	421.8	 She's never heard it before because we're in Alaska.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=424.9s	424.9	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=426.4s	426.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=429.6s	429.6	 Yes, I really wanted to test even little distractions like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=433.7s	433.7	 Some new animal, I don't know, is it a bird?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=435.4s	435.4	 Was it a squirrel?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=436.1s	436.1	 Squirrel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=436.6s	436.6	 It was a really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=437.4s	437.4	 Yeah, it was a squirrel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=439.1s	439.1	 Wow, I didn't know squirrels could sound like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=441.4s	441.4	 I noticed that she was mildly distracted, but I was like, hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=444.6s	444.6	 if I can get her to lie down while distracted, even though it's a minor distraction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=448.8s	448.8	 that's good practice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=450.2s	450.2	 Now, there are some distractions that are way too intense for many dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=453.9s	453.9	 depending on where you are in your training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=456.1s	456.1	 And Ursa has a weak spot for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=458.0s	458.0	 She loves to play with dogs and really wants to interact with every dog she sees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=461.9s	461.9	 And that's something you've been watching us work on over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=464.6s	464.6	 And she's getting better and better at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=466.3s	466.3	 Ideally, I don't want her to start barking because she heard something new over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=470.0s	470.0	 I'd rather kind of keep this distance right here and then have her lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=474.3s	474.3	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=475.2s	475.2	 The important thing I want you to remember is when dealing with distractions on a walk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=478.8s	478.8	 distance is your friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=479.8s	479.8	 You want to create distance until your dog becomes more and more reliable over time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=484.2s	484.2	 with the more life experience that they acquire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=487.6s	487.6	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=488.4s	488.4	 So she's obviously distracted and barking at something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=491.8s	491.8	 Very good example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=492.6s	492.6	 That's what I do when she becomes distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=495.3s	495.3	 I resist pulling her away unless it's urgent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=497.6s	497.6	 And I need to get her away from whatever it is that's causing her to behave that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=500.7s	500.7	 But I got her to voluntarily go without pulling on the leash at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=504.4s	504.4	 And then I create a distance until I could verify that she was reliable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=507.9s	507.9	 by asking her to lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=509.8s	509.8	 In that case, I walked away a few feet and I thought I would try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=512.6s	512.6	 But I could see in her eyes she was still pretty distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=515.4s	515.4	 So I thought it might be a better idea to go a few more feet before asking her to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=518.6s	518.6	 something basic like a lie down in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=520.8s	520.8	 You may also notice that I choose to walk inertia on a harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=524.1s	524.1	 That's because I don't want any tension around her neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=527.0s	527.0	 Now, a lot of people are under the impression that a harness like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=529.7s	529.7	 may actually encourage your dog to pull.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=532.0s	532.0	 But I got to tell you, I don't see it that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=534.0s	534.0	 See, a harness like this is just a management device.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=536.8s	536.8	 It's not like I'm using it to train her or physically manipulate her in any way at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=541.7s	541.7	 The goal is to actually teach her to think through her actions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=545.0s	545.0	 so that she actually understands how to behave rather than relying on being told how to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=550.1s	550.1	 For me, it's vital when teaching a dog that I find a way to motivate them to do whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=554.6s	554.6	 it is that I'm asking and that I don't force them to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=557.8s	557.8	 But dogs are smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=558.7s	558.7	 So they'll learn this as long as you take the time to patiently teach them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=561.8s	561.8	 When you're on a walk with a dog, you're going to find things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=565.5s	565.5	 like bicycles driving by that your dog finds very tempting and distracting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=570.2s	570.2	 There's no way around that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=571.4s	571.4	 It's important to really be understanding of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=574.2s	574.2	 and work with them through those distractions as you've seen us do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=577.6s	577.6	 Leash walking takes lots of time, patience, and consistency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=581.3s	581.3	 But you can do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLNwGSAASOE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=582.8s	582.8	 I know you can.
