https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FSQTmlXfWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=33&pp=iAQB&t=4.6s	4.6	 So it's really on how you use them, right? You can use a choke chain non-aversively,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FSQTmlXfWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=33&pp=iAQB&t=8.7s	8.7	 and that's not who I'm after. When they're being used as a management solution, there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FSQTmlXfWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=33&pp=iAQB&t=12.5s	12.5	 are legitimate cases where that's not the problem. So I'm not picking on people who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FSQTmlXfWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=33&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 use aversive tools non-aversively without providing those really quick, harsh physical

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FSQTmlXfWI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=33&pp=iAQB&t=26.7s	26.7	 professional dog trainers who advise the public specifically. I think it is problematic when
