https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx2lZcPFhsg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=16&pp=iAQB&t=4.4s	4.4	 And I had to explain that I don't let any dogs of mine off lead in a completely uncontrolled situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx2lZcPFhsg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=16&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 under the age of two. And she's only one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx2lZcPFhsg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=16&pp=iAQB&t=18.6s	18.6	 There's rarely tension on the leash, which means as far as she's concerned, the leash isn't even necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx2lZcPFhsg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=16&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 But I still want to see many more examples of that leash not being necessary, even in new and exciting environments.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx2lZcPFhsg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=16&pp=iAQB&t=32.6s	32.6	 Setting your dog up for success saves you tons of time in the long run with off leash training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx2lZcPFhsg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=16&pp=iAQB&t=38.3s	38.3	 Come on, Veronica, let's go!
