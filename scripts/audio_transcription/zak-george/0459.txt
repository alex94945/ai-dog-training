https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=36.3s	36.3	 You're a disaster, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=37.6s	37.6	 Pterodactyl treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 First ingredient in this one is duck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 I mean, ducks are basically pterodactyl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=51.6s	51.6	 I wonder what would happen if a Labrador Retriever and a Woolly Mammoth and a Pterodactyl got into a fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 The Pterodactyl flies in and...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 Perhaps the biggest overgeneralization relating to a dog's personality and their behavior traits

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=103.9s	103.9	 There are certain qualities that are often true based on a dog's breed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=107.3s	107.3	 A Border Collie is more likely to have natural sustained focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=111.4s	111.4	 A German Shepherd is guaranteed to shed.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=116.1s	116.1	 It just shouldn't be weighted anywhere near as heavily as most people, including dog professionals, do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=122.1s	122.1	 I want to be very clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=123.2s	123.2	 You don't train a dog based on their breed stereotype.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=126.4s	126.4	 You determine your training strategy based on your dog's energy level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 and their individual personality with all of their quirks and eccentricities.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 But the variance and therefore the approach we take between dogs of the same exact breed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=142.3s	142.3	 can vary tremendously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=144.1s	144.1	 Anyone who's spent enough time with lots of dogs knows that sometimes a Labrador can be overflowing with energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=150.2s	150.2	 But another Labrador could just as easily be very mellow or even fearful too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=154.7s	154.7	 A dog's energy level, not their breed, is a far more reliable indicator for the training approach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 you should adopt with that individual dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 Let's go over the three categories of energy levels and what they mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=167.5s	167.5	 Geez, you're heavy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 You do know you have muscles in your legs, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 You can actually use them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 Level one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=173.7s	173.7	 Level one dogs are laid back, lower energy dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=176.7s	176.7	 They'll be happy to just take a short walk with you each day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=179.2s	179.2	 and they'll basically just chill out for the rest of the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 They're great if you're a busy person who wants a calm, low-key companion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 But don't expect a level one dog to play vigorously for long periods of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=189.2s	189.2	 or to play really at all for that matter.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=196.5s	196.5	 This doesn't mean they're less intelligent though, just more relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=199.7s	199.7	 Level one dogs tend to naturally be pretty well behaved and polite too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 You're rolling over too much.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=205.2s	205.2	 Your leash is all wrapped around you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 Now let's talk about level two dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=208.9s	208.9	 They tend to be a little bit more well-rounded as it relates to energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=212.1s	212.1	 and tend to have a little bit more mental and physical stamina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=215.3s	215.3	 A level two dog is a dog that tends to be really hyper when you get home from work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=219.3s	219.3	 but then tends to calm down after a few minutes without much encouragement from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 Boy, he loves this one mammoth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=225.5s	225.5	 Level two dogs can have substantial bursts of energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 and generally require fairly significant exercise to realize their true potential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=233.3s	233.3	 In general, level two dogs are great for a less experienced person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=236.8s	236.8	 who still wants to have a hands-on role in teaching their dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=262.6s	262.6	 you might need a dog with a little bit more energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=264.7s	264.7	 Now let's talk about those super high energy dogs, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=267.6s	267.6	 the ones that can play all day and all night.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=275.0s	275.0	 The ones whose tails are almost always wagging at 100 miles an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=278.4s	278.4	 They're basically like this if you don't exercise them every waking hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoJym_wQ2M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 These are the level three dogs and let me let you in on a big secret.
