https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=7.9s	7.9	 So many of us are spending unnecessary time driving to the store to get heavy bags of dog food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 and carrying them to and from our car every week.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=37.2s	37.2	 All those details are in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 Today I'm joined by Rex and he's only three months old so he's still working on his fundamentals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=44.1s	44.1	 Many of you out there have small dogs and I know I regularly receive inquiries as to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=48.2s	48.2	 what we need to do differently with small dogs as opposed to larger dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=51.9s	51.9	 Well, we're gonna find out with Rex today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=54.4s	54.4	 Hey Rex, come here!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=55.5s	55.5	 Oh boy, I think we'll definitely need to work on come when called.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=58.3s	58.3	 When training virtually any dog, you'll find that they're more responsive the closer you are to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 Now I like to call this the training bubble. The distance between your eyes and their eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 So one of the first things you'll notice about working with a smaller dog is that, well, they're small.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=73.7s	73.7	 So the distance between your eyes is quite significant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 See, when you're close to your dog during training, it's a lot easier to keep their attention on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=80.5s	80.5	 And if you try to get them to listen to you while you're farther away, that training bubble pops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=85.2s	85.2	 So we have to nourish it and build it slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=88.2s	88.2	 So since smaller dogs are closer to the floor, well ideally that means you should be closer to the floor too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=94.1s	94.1	 At least in the beginning parts of training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=96.2s	96.2	 Do you know how to sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=97.4s	97.4	 Look at that. All right, so his family's been working with him a little bit on sit it looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=101.5s	101.5	 Sit looks really reliable but look how far away we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 I mean we're practically nose to nose right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 So let me just demonstrate my point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 Let's see what happens when I ask Rex to sit when the distance between our eyes is greater.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 Rex, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 So right there he's looking at me and he's like, what are you talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=116.1s	116.1	 Let's try it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 Rex, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=120.1s	120.1	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=120.6s	120.6	 If I'm over here and I say sit, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 He pops right into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=124.2s	124.2	 But you could definitely see he was a little bit confused there when I asked him to sit from a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=128.5s	128.5	 The idea here is to see if we can extend the training bubble in order to get Rex to focus on something basic like sit from a farther distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=136.9s	136.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=137.4s	137.4	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 So that's a little bit farther away, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=140.9s	140.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=141.4s	141.4	 Excellent, James.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 Excellent job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=144.4s	144.4	 There are some of us who might find it more difficult to get close to the ground when training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=148.1s	148.1	 And if that's the case, try using a great treat and really prioritize teaching look at me to strengthen that training bubble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 And see, if you really get look at me solid like this, then that will have a lot of positive effects on your training bubble in terms of making it bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 All puppies have to learn how to reliably come to us when we call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=165.9s	165.9	 Most dogs don't generalize this skill from new place to new place or from circumstance to circumstance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 And when you're training your dog to come to you, your training bubble is really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=175.7s	175.7	 Too often we expect our dogs to come to us from across the house or across a big field without extensive training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=181.5s	181.5	 And that's not realistic for most dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=183.5s	183.5	 That's why you really need to focus on training your dog to come when called in a small area like this at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=189.7s	189.7	 There's not a lot of distractions to throw them off and you can really focus on teaching them the concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=195.4s	195.4	 Not everyone's comfortable with it, but if you are, get real low to the ground like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=199.3s	199.3	 It's much more inviting when those big human eyes are right there inviting a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 If you've got a brand new dog, focus on getting them to come to you from just a couple of feet away at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 And use tiny treats liberally and an upbeat fun tone to direct them and motivate them to come to you as you call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=214.4s	214.4	 Now, if your dog is a little bitey or you're not totally comfortable with your dog, use discretion here, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=219.7s	219.7	 Let's see if we can get them to come from a little bit farther away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 Come here, Rex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=225.8s	225.8	 Rex, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 Rex, Rex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=228.1s	228.1	 So right there, he's ignoring me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 He kind of acknowledged me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=231.2s	231.2	 He's thinking about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=232.5s	232.5	 But watch, I have a hunch if I get real low to the ground right now, he's going to come running to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=236.7s	236.7	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=237.7s	237.7	 Rex, I mean, look at that, just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 And so that really illustrates the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=242.1s	242.1	 When you get down here like this, dogs are like, oh, you look a lot more interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 And resist the urge to get mad or frustrated when your dog invariably doesn't come to you sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 Hey, Rex, come here, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=253.3s	253.3	 Right now, Rex is walking around over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=255.4s	255.4	 He's not coming to me when I call him as quickly as I'd like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 So what do you do when your dog actually doesn't come to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=261.1s	261.1	 First, we're going to shrink our training bubble and try and provide some additional motivation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=264.9s	264.9	 I'm going to let him know I've got that treat, but I'm not going to give him a treat for not listening to me, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=268.8s	268.8	 I'm just going to have him walk like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=271.1s	271.1	 Come on, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 That way, they really learn to go through the motions of actually walking towards you when you call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=277.5s	277.5	 And remember, if you got a puppy like this, you need to make sure that you have treats located all over the place,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=282.2s	282.2	 out of your dog's reach, that keep well at room temperature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=284.9s	284.9	 So that you can jump into these spontaneous training sessions as needed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=292.2s	292.2	 Just like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=293.4s	293.4	 Sometimes dogs are so excited or maybe you're using treats that your dog isn't too enthused about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=298.6s	298.6	 What do you do in that situation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=300.2s	300.2	 Well, there's no harm in picking them up and bringing them back to where you called them from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=304.2s	304.2	 While that doesn't really teach them to come to you, it still shows them that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=307.2s	307.2	 look, I'm still going to enforce the rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 You can't ignore me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=310.2s	310.2	 But training sessions like this aren't where you teach your dog to reliably come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=314.6s	314.6	 These sessions in the beginning are just focused on teaching your dog the general concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=319.4s	319.4	 It can take many months to get your dog to come to you in much more distracting situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 Start calling them when you're cooking dinner, watching TV, on the internet, or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=327.9s	327.9	 And really catch them off guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 That'll prepare them for more realistic situations when you need them to come to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=333.7s	333.7	 even when they don't want to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 And as we know, the biggest mistake by new puppy parents?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=337.9s	337.9	 Too much freedom, too early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=339.2s	339.2	 So always make sure that your dog is on leash, especially when you're teaching them to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=343.5s	343.5	 Whether you're inside or outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=345.9s	345.9	 The reason is, if they get away with routinely disregarding your request to come to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=350.5s	350.5	 well, it's going to set your training back significantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=353.4s	353.4	 If this has already happened with you, that's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=355.8s	355.8	 Just take a step back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=357.1s	357.1	 Understand it's going to take a little bit more work since the habit is well established
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 of not listening to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=362.2s	362.2	 But it's never too late to start over and commit to being consistent from now on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=366.3s	366.3	 So what about teaching your dog to lie down, for example?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=369.3s	369.3	 Believe it or not, this is one of a handful of behaviors that is a little bit different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=373.7s	373.7	 when you're teaching a smaller dog, at least for most smaller dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=376.8s	376.8	 Normally what we do with larger dogs is we try and lure them straight down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=380.2s	380.2	 and many larger dogs will follow that right into a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=383.4s	383.4	 But smaller dogs, not so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=385.3s	385.3	 This has more to do with their anatomy than it does with intelligence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 I mean, it just is more awkward to lure a smaller dog into a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=392.6s	392.6	 This requires you as a trainer to get a little bit more creative with your lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=396.2s	396.2	 Maybe you might want to go from side...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=397.8s	397.8	 Look at that, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 See how I went to the side?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=399.7s	399.7	 I've worked with many small dogs where this can be a two-week process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=402.5s	402.5	 So he's doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=404.4s	404.4	 Look at that right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=405.6s	405.6	 And I don't know if you noticed that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=407.4s	407.4	 That was a little bit different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=408.4s	408.4	 Rather than coming out like this, I actually went in towards his chest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=411.5s	411.5	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=411.9s	411.9	 See how he's going backwards and then through the legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=415.2s	415.2	 It's almost like they fall into the down right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=417.7s	417.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrYfsr4UDI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=417&pp=iAQB&t=418.6s	418.6	 Click thumbs up for Rex.
