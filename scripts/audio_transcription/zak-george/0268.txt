https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 And it has been for some time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=154.4s	154.4	 My goal has always been to teach her that biting is okay, as long as it's with permission
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=158.3s	158.3	 and with stuff that I approve of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 When we first got Inertia, she was pretty subdued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 In fact, she spent most of her time sleeping.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 So I was wondering, I mean, did I actually get lucky and just happen to get a puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=172.4s	172.4	 that didn't bite?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 And no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 Inertia is actually one of the most significant puppy biters that I've ever encountered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 She'd bite my flesh and it would hurt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 She'd bite at my clothes any chance she got, especially shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 Man, did she love shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 And of course, biting her leash was irresistible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=192.7s	192.7	 It's like if it existed, she was going to bite it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=196.3s	196.3	 Inertia had three really distinct biting habits that needed attention and all of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=200.4s	200.4	 took different amounts of time to resolve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 The first one was probably the most obnoxious and that's of course biting flesh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=207.1s	207.1	 See, there's a bite of the arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=209.4s	209.4	 Ouch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=210.4s	210.4	 That's too hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 She left a little mark there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 Remember puppies bite because they're teething and they want to engage you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 And the most natural way that they know how to do that is with their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=221.8s	221.8	 Puppies are going to grab things that interest them, just like infants will grab things that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 interest them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=227.2s	227.2	 In fact, I believe we should nurture this curiosity and encourage them to grab things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=231.3s	231.3	 But we need to show them what's okay to grab and what isn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 So when your puppy does bite you, redirecting their attention onto a toy or into a training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 session is the way to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 And I know what you're thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=242.7s	242.7	 That's easier said than done, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=244.5s	244.5	 So let me show you how we actually got it done from start to finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=248.6s	248.6	 We're in that prime teething season and biting season right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=251.9s	251.9	 She just bites and bites everything that she comes into contact with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=254.9s	254.9	 You can just look at my arms right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 There's bite marks all over them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=258.6s	258.6	 As I tell you guys very often, it's not reasonable to expect the dog to just stop biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=264.5s	264.5	 It gets worse before it gets better at this age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=266.9s	266.9	 I've been really careful to give her plenty of things that are acceptable to bite on because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 they need to bite at this age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 So obviously lots of play, lots of chew toys, lots of biting is the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=277.6s	277.6	 In short, I'm not discouraging the biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=279.6s	279.6	 I'm encouraging the biting, but with acceptable items because I have lots of plans for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=283.9s	283.9	 to use that mouth to grab all sorts of things and to use it for training and rewards.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 bite and when it's socially acceptable and when it's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 OK, now here's how inertia was looking almost two weeks later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=298.8s	298.8	 So the biting is definitely being reduced because I'm consistently redirecting her when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=303.5s	303.5	 she bites too hard or getting her to engage in a play session or if she's really rambunctious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=308.8s	308.8	 just giving her a brief timeout to calm down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 I say this because even at three weeks in, I still have a dog that is puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=314.7s	314.7	 It does go on for an extended period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=317.4s	317.4	 What you're looking for is slow, steady reduction over that period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=321.3s	321.3	 But we probably still have another few weeks of puppy biting in store.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=325.4s	325.4	 After three weeks, we were definitely seeing progress, but she was still biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 And you know what?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=332.0s	332.0	 Puppies have to both make it through their teething phase and gain the experience and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 And if you think about it, that is a lot to ask of an animal that's only been on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=342.9s	342.9	 planet for 10 weeks or so.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=349.1s	349.1	 to bite, we cannot forget about management.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=352.2s	352.2	 In the case of puppy biting, this means having your dog on leash so that you can restrict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=356.0s	356.0	 them from having access to family members, small children or anything else inappropriate

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 It's also important to proactively desensitize them to being touched like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=366.2s	366.2	 So I've really been prioritizing getting her comfortable with being touched, like her feet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=370.3s	370.3	 her nails, her ears, touching her teeth, brushing her teeth and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=374.4s	374.4	 So with a puppy like this, I mean, every day just spend a lot of time giving them a massage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=379.1s	379.1	 And of course, it makes it a lot easier when you let them nibble on a tasty treat like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=382.1s	382.1	 this too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=383.1s	383.1	 It keeps them occupied and it also conditions them to enjoy the actual touching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=387.6s	387.6	 Good job, honey.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 puppy bites you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=397.5s	397.5	 way to address this because it really addresses the symptom, you know, your dog biting you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 and not really the cause, which is your dog's desire to interact with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=406.2s	406.2	 That's why I think it's really important to focus on teaching your dog what they should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=409.5s	409.5	 do like biting appropriate toys or focus their excess energy on training.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=421.6s	421.6	 If you're really trying to measure progress, I think one of the things that you should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=424.2s	424.2	 be looking for are greater instances of your puppy licking you where they used to bite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=429.2s	429.2	 you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=431.2s	431.2	 So that is like she has just started probably in the last 24 hours starting to lick where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=436.5s	436.5	 she would otherwise bite.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=442.1s	442.1	 you're doing your job right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=456.7s	456.7	 our flesh.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=461.9s	461.9	 still other types of biting we had to contend with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=464.8s	464.8	 Next to chomping down on my skin, inertia's second favorite thing to bite were my clothes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=469.0s	469.0	 and my shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=470.7s	470.7	 This is a clip of nine week old inertia.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=476.5s	476.5	 My shoelaces can't stay tied for more than a minute or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=480.0s	480.0	 I think my shoelaces were actually untied for inertia's entire ninth week of life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=485.0s	485.0	 And you guys know how much I love my shoes, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=488.4s	488.4	 So this was a really hard time for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=490.8s	490.8	 So obviously I had to get that under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=493.5s	493.5	 Here's how we dealt with clothes and shoelace biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=496.3s	496.3	 I've been doing a lot of redirecting when she's chewing my shoelace like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=500.0s	500.0	 You know, I have lots of these toys on standby to try and get her attention on it rather

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=507.9s	507.9	 do wrong this time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=509.2s	509.2	 I still want to keep her in a really trainable upbeat mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=512.8s	512.8	 Remember when your puppy is biting, you basically have three options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=516.8s	516.8	 Redirect them into some type of play session with a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=519.7s	519.7	 Redirect them into a training session using treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=522.4s	522.4	 Or give them a brief timeout if they're just too overstimulated or you're unable or unwilling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=526.7s	526.7	 to tend to them at that particular time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=529.0s	529.0	 By time out, I simply mean giving them a break in their puppy bedroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=532.2s	532.2	 For many of you that might be a crate or their exercise pen or a spare room in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=536.3s	536.3	 And make sure they have plenty of safe things to chew on while they're in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=540.1s	540.1	 You know, things like this that have varying textures are really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=543.8s	543.8	 I told you Pup Box had you covered.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=549.9s	549.9	 Sometimes they're in the mood to play or other times they're in the mood for a training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=553.8s	553.8	 So make sure to be flexible depending on how your dog is feeling in that particular moment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=570.8s	570.8	 What's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=571.8s	571.8	 Get it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=581.6s	581.6	 now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=584.5s	584.5	 Let me see if I can get her attention off of the shoelace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=588.2s	588.2	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=593.4s	593.4	 Let's see if we can get her over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=594.4s	594.4	 Hey, I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=595.4s	595.4	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=598.9s	598.9	 I like what you did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=599.9s	599.9	 Here is something great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=600.9s	600.9	 How about a sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=601.9s	601.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=602.9s	602.9	 And she's going to go into a down because I already know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=605.6s	605.6	 So I'm going to say down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=607.3s	607.3	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=611.2s	611.2	 I'm rewarding her for following my lure going into a sit, a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=615.0s	615.0	 And of course there are going to be times where your dog doesn't want to play or do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=618.0s	618.0	 a training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=619.3s	619.3	 In those times it might be best to give your dog a little bit of alone time and just refrain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=623.1s	623.1	 from interacting with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=624.6s	624.6	 I mean, sometimes you just have to let your puppy be a puppy for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=627.7s	627.7	 All right, so that's the bottom line, but this didn't magically just stop her shoelace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=632.0s	632.0	 and pants biting overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=633.8s	633.8	 I've had inertia now for three weeks and honestly one of the big roadblocks that we've had to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=639.3s	639.3	 encounter is constant biting at my shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=642.2s	642.2	 So on this day, I decided that I really needed to be able to just walk around without having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=646.9s	646.9	 a puppy attached to my ankle at all times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=650.2s	650.2	 Here's how I did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=651.2s	651.2	 My goal here is to be able to walk back and forth on this carpet right here without her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=654.6s	654.6	 biting my shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=655.6s	655.6	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=657.6s	657.6	 Okay, come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=665.3s	665.3	 that you're not biting my shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=667.2s	667.2	 Those of you who have had really rambunctious puppy biters who just go at your shoes constantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=671.2s	671.2	 will know what I'm talking about here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=672.8s	672.8	 See how she's thinking about going for my shoelaces right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=675.1s	675.1	 It's just on the tail end, I hope, of getting resolved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=677.8s	677.8	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=679.9s	679.9	 She went into a sit and decided not to go for my laces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=683.3s	683.3	 Here's how inertia looked after another few days of doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=685.9s	685.9	 You can see even some of that shoelace biting is still around, though we have definitely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=690.0s	690.0	 made progress on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=692.0s	692.0	 That's enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=693.0s	693.0	 Easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=694.0s	694.0	 Thank you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=710.5s	710.5	 For example, I know that if I get up right now, there's a good chance she's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=714.1s	714.1	 go for my pant leg or something.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=736.9s	736.9	 I really want that chicken.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=752.8s	752.8	 But understand there is a learning curve and that's okay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=821.0s	821.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=822.0s	822.0	 Notice the position of my shoe right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=823.1s	823.1	 I'm keeping it away from her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=824.4s	824.4	 I want to be able to put that shoelace right under her nose and have her leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=829.5s	829.5	 Once your puppy is able to leave your shoes alone while they're still like this, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=833.3s	833.3	 time to up the ante and have them practice leaving you alone while you're moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=837.6s	837.6	 I mean, there are so many dimensions to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=839.9s	839.9	 I mean, leaving your shoes alone is one thing, but you really have to break this challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=844.4s	844.4	 down and give your dog experience with leaving things alone in as many situations as you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=849.5s	849.5	 can think of in order to really help them generalize the idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=853.2s	853.2	 I mean, what a project, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=855.4s	855.4	 Notice how she's not going for my laces as she has in past leash walking sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=859.7s	859.7	 So that's improvement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=860.7s	860.7	 Okay, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=861.9s	861.9	 Oh, she thought about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=864.8s	864.8	 Can you give me a sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=866.5s	866.5	 I'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=867.5s	867.5	 You see how she's just now really fighting that urge to go into the biting the pant legs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=872.6s	872.6	 and biting the shoelaces because that's what's natural for her to want to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=876.1s	876.1	 So this is starting to get a little bit of traction and this is really the last time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=879.8s	879.8	 that I remember any significant biting of my shoelaces or my pants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=883.9s	883.9	 Once your dog really starts to understand what you want, you have to remain consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=889.0s	889.0	 But if you do, you should start to see the biting fade out much more quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=893.1s	893.1	 In fact, by the time inertia was 14 weeks old, virtually all of her puppy biting habits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=897.9s	897.9	 were under control except for one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=900.9s	900.9	 It was really hard for her to resist biting her leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=904.1s	904.1	 And I'm talking about that really excessive kind of leash biting that interrupts any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=908.1s	908.1	 meaningful training opportunity that you could possibly hope to have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=911.7s	911.7	 It's hard to blame her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=912.7s	912.7	 It's basically a long string toy that's constantly attached to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=916.5s	916.5	 It takes a lot of self-control to resist something that's just dangling in front of your face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=920.5s	920.5	 all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=921.5s	921.5	 Here's how we focused on getting her leash biting urges under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=925.5s	925.5	 Inertia's puppy biting is definitely subsiding and getting more under control with the exception
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=930.5s	930.5	 of probably biting at the lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=932.5s	932.5	 So this is still something that really tempts her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=934.9s	934.9	 Sometimes I'll use this long 15-foot lead before a potty break or before a training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=938.6s	938.6	 session and you can see how dangly it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=940.7s	940.7	 Now, of course, with the gentle leave it, I can get her to stop there as long as I get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=944.5s	944.5	 her focused on me and I'm careful to go ahead and follow that up with a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=948.4s	948.4	 I like to do many dedicated training sessions to things like this to help inertia understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=953.2s	953.2	 how I want her to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=954.9s	954.9	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=955.9s	955.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=956.9s	956.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=958.0s	958.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=959.0s	959.0	 So, when your dog is doing something predictable, preempt those undesirable behaviors before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=963.4s	963.4	 they occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=964.8s	964.8	 Once something has happened twice in a row, it's a pattern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=967.3s	967.3	 So bottom line, the biting of my flesh faded out first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=970.6s	970.6	 That took about three weeks of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=972.6s	972.6	 It took about four weeks to get her shoe and pants biting under control and it took about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=976.7s	976.7	 six weeks to get her super excessive leash biting under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=980.5s	980.5	 So remember, the puppy biting phase is just part of having a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=984.3s	984.3	 It will get better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6yT7RhJ8A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=985.8s	985.8	 Get 50% off of your first PupBox when you sign up for a three-sixth or 12-month subscription.
