https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 It's no secret that when we're teaching our dogs we need to clearly communicate what we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=19.6s	19.6	 like as well as what we don't like.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=25.3s	25.3	 at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 You can eliminate a major chore from your life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=30.1s	30.1	 You can find the same food that your dog already loves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=32.8s	32.8	 You can also get some of the harder to find organic dog foods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=35.8s	35.8	 Peplow literally has hundreds of brands.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=52.4s	52.4	 Before we start today's training.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=55.8s	55.8	 I want to make sure that we're on the same page with how dogs learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 Very simply, if the outcome to a behavior is favorable to a dog, well they're more likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=63.7s	63.7	 to repeat that behavior in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 But if the outcome to a particular action is less favorable to a dog, well they're less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 likely to repeat that action in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=73.1s	73.1	 Being a good dog trainer requires you to balance both of those things often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=76.9s	76.9	 Traditional dog training often relies on physically correcting a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 You know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=81.3s	81.3	 It's got some serious limitations, not the least of which is that it's not exactly pleasant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=85.9s	85.9	 for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=86.9s	86.9	 But also things like choke chains and prong collars, well they only work when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 And I don't know about you, but I want my dog listening to me regardless of what kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 of collar they're wearing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=95.5s	95.5	 So for that reason, I've got to teach really reliable communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=98.9s	98.9	 This doesn't mean that we avoid providing undesirable outcomes to behaviors we don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=103.5s	103.5	 like or when they're on the wrong track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=105.9s	105.9	 But any training strategy that relies on correcting a dog more than connecting with a dog, well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 that's going to produce inferior results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=113.1s	113.1	 For example, you're probably going to be a lot happier at a job if your boss continually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 goes out of their way to acknowledge the things you're doing right time after time and gives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=121.5s	121.5	 you intelligent guidance when you do occasionally slip up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 Be that to your dog and pay them well while they're in training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=129.3s	129.3	 For dogs, there are two main types of currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=132.3s	132.3	 You can reward with food or you can reward with play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 Now environment is actually the third type of currency and as you get better with training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=139.7s	139.7	 your dog, you'll be good about finding opportunities to use the environment as a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=144.7s	144.7	 Today I'm going to show you how to use all three forms of currency to both reward and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=148.9s	148.9	 correct your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=149.9s	149.9	 Think of food rewards as currency to your dog, but all food rewards are not created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=154.4s	154.4	 equal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 I like to use something like real chicken or deli meat, just something that will stimulate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 in order to keep them really engaged and interested in training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=164.7s	164.7	 A tiny piece of meat like this is equivalent to one dollar, whereas say a softer training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 treat might be like a quarter to your dog and their kibble, well that's like a penny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 I want the treats that I use to be extra special during training and even better than their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=176.9s	176.9	 normal food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 Keep them small and use a really good tasting treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 Let's cover the basics and how and when to pay our dogs by teaching Bruno to look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=184.2s	184.2	 me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 Teaching your dog to look at you is extremely important so that you can really effectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 guide them in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=190.1s	190.1	 I'm only going to reward him when I have direct eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 Now I'm going to start by letting him know I've got a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 I'm going to hold it up here to try and get his attention onto me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=198.9s	198.9	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=199.9s	199.9	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 And I'm giving him the food reward because I like the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 He's on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=204.9s	204.9	 But honestly, right now he's just looking at a treat, isn't he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=207.5s	207.5	 He's not really looking at me when I ask for his eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=210.2s	210.2	 So I think I'm ready to phase in a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=212.3s	212.3	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=213.3s	213.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=216.8s	216.8	 It's not up here and coming from my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 It's coming from a different location.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=220.6s	220.6	 I'll tell you what, let's throw a curve ball at Bruno right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 I'm going to let him know I've got these treats over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 I'm going to distract him and I'm going to try and get him to look at me right now with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 But look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 He's having no part of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 This is my first opportunity right now to create an undesired outcome to the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=236.7s	236.7	 I'm saying look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=238.4s	238.4	 Bruno is not looking at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=239.6s	239.6	 He's trying to get to the food in my hand, but he's not getting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=242.9s	242.9	 Do you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=243.9s	243.9	 The corrective action here is he has no access to the food.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=251.8s	251.8	 our past lesson.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=277.2s	277.2	 get his eyes on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=278.2s	278.2	 Look at him thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=279.2s	279.2	 Oh, I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=281.2s	281.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=282.2s	282.2	 That was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=283.2s	283.2	 So I got his eyes on me in the presence of something he really likes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=286.6s	286.6	 The eyes are everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=288.0s	288.0	 Giving and withholding treats like this can be a great way to fuse your communication

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=294.3s	294.3	 But how do we use play to motivate our dogs to learn?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=297.3s	297.3	 Bruno is a pretty severe play biter, as you can see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=299.7s	299.7	 So I'd like to make gains in two major areas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=302.3s	302.3	 I'd like to show him how to behave more politely when he's presented with an exciting situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=308.4s	308.4	 And I, of course, would like to show him the right things to bite on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 Right now, he's biting me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=312.9s	312.9	 How do I, how do I correct?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=313.9s	313.9	 Let me look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=314.9s	314.9	 That was, he just got me real good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=316.7s	316.7	 How do I correct this without physically punishing him to let him know I don't like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=321.3s	321.3	 I want to do everything I can to redirect his attention into a sit and get him biting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=329.1s	329.1	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=330.1s	330.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=331.1s	331.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 The toy is just a tool that you use to really engage your dog in a fun way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=337.2s	337.2	 A four second game of tug of war can be like a $10 bill to a lot of dogs, but you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=341.9s	341.9	 to show them how to earn it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 Let go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=345.4s	345.4	 Now, if you need help with teaching your dog to let go, I'll have a video in the description.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=352.1s	352.1	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=353.1s	353.1	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=354.1s	354.1	 It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=355.1s	355.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=356.1s	356.1	 And so it's less about tug of war and more just the act of playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 You could even just toss the ball a few feet if your dog was really good at fetching as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 a reward.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=366.9s	366.9	 doing something you don't like, turn the tables on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=369.7s	369.7	 Try and motivate them to behave in a way that's going to get them what they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=373.5s	373.5	 Those of you who are struggling with normal puppy biting, I'm going to have a link in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=381.7s	381.7	 Many of you have probably experienced this at home with your own dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=384.3s	384.3	 When you go to get the leash or you ask them if they want to go on a walk, many of your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=390.5s	390.5	 Use those opportunities to teach your dog so that you can provide that amazing reward

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=409.3s	409.3	 You're a perfect dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=410.5s	410.5	 You could put your dog on a leash, thereby restricting their access to the exciting situation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=425.7s	425.7	 unresponsive to working for a tug toy or working for a food reward because they're just so

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=435.6s	435.6	 in and you need to change their environment a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=438.1s	438.1	 For example, let's say you're taking a walk, your dog is barking and lunging towards another

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=450.5s	450.5	 And that's how you know that they're in a trainable mindset and then slowly work up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerhIKIx1Q8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=497&pp=iAQB&t=454.2s	454.2	 to getting them to listen to you run more distracting situations later.
