https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 There are pros and cons to having a big class. On one hand you have to manage them, but on the other hand, for the people to be working with their dogs in a very distracting situation, it's kind of a blessing in disguise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 Because our training doesn't really mean much unless they'll do it when they're distracted. So that is the benefit to having a big class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 Don't touch it. Uh-uh, what did I say? No? Please leave that alone. That's not right. No? That's not right. That's right. Yes, very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 Do you see this? This is a Chihuahua Yorkie right here. I mean, it's a dog. Click and reward that in the initial stages and then ask for more and more as he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 He? Really? As he succeeds. Why did I click? Zam did not sit. He almost did. Exactly. He's on the right track. And it's important to let our dogs know when they're on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 Yes, almost. Very good. And I didn't, I'm not saying sit, sit, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 Yes, very good sit. It was brief, but it was there. Yep, that's it. And you can kind of lure closer. Yeah, almost. Yeah, but that's it. You got the right idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 You're telling the way you talk to her is perfect. It's important to actually kind of let them nibble on the treat as you're luring them into a down. So it's like this. Yes, it's good. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 Yes, lie down. Very good. You see that? That's all we're encouraging them to do. Sit, but he won't lie down. Right. Watch with a hyper dog like this. It's all about timing. All right. You got to be quick. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 Do you see that instantly? Are you doing that? Are you really quick like that? No, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 Sit. Nope. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 Eventually, I'm going to go a little slower. I'm just letting them lick my hand. Do you see that? And I'm holding the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 Yes, good. I'm going to reward that because it was better than the last time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 I'm going to get a little lower. I'm going to put the training bubble in the back because what I'm doing isn't working as fast as I think it should. So I'm going to get back down. No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 Yes, that was much. You see how we almost did it? Yep, that was close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 There we go. Doing well. Doing well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 Yes. Good. Good. Good. Much better. Do you see the progress here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 You told me he hadn't sat in six years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 And now he's sitting on command.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 How are we doing on Leave It? He what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 Sit. Wait. Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 Nope. I got all day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 Yes. Yes. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Watch. Sit. Don't touch this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 What are you talking about? You say he never does it at home. That was beautiful. It's all about communication. What that means, what that tells me is you need to get your communication tighter, which is why you're here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Very good. Don't make him wait for an eternity before you give it to him in the initial stages. Don't touch it. That is real meat. Look at that. Boom. You are awesome. I told you he's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 Look at these hops. That's what I want to breathe. That's what I'm feeling. Well, he, all right, is he getting his exercise? Yeah. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 But he does this all the time. Okay. Well, we're going to cover jumping next week. If that's what you're, I think that's one of the things that I think. That and running away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 Stay with distractions and come when called. We're going to cover come when called now and stay with distractions next week. Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=223.0s	223.0	 And this week, all of you can see this. I'm not going to move him. Stay. That was one. Stay. One, two, three. Stay. One, two, three, four, five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 I almost pushed him to failure there. It's very important that your dog does not fail more than one time in a row.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 The reason for that is if we get in this habit of just constantly going back and forth, we're going to have to do it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=246.0s	246.0	 It's very important that your dog does not fail more than one time in a row.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 The reason for that is if we get in this habit of just constantly correcting them, training isn't as fun for them and they learn at a much slower rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 Let me see a sit, stay. You can do this. You can do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 Hand signal. One, two, click, reward. Bam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=269.0s	269.0	 Six years old. Am I right? Yes. Six years old, learning sit and stay with the first dog. And doing it well. Doing it well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 With him, you've got to kind of call him and do it up. I remember. Come on. Come here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yes. Up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=281.0s	281.0	 You've got to be more animated with him. I remember that last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 The way we repair a relapse is by reinstituting the training bubble, getting back down and pretending we haven't taught it to them and starting over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 It'll take just a minute, but make that extra effort to get back down there to communicate with them anytime that you see them saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 Nah, I don't want to do it even though I've demonstrated that. I know what you're asking in the past. Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=301.0s	301.0	 That one thing will save you so much and it's something you don't hear a lot about though. Just get back close to them and refine it a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=310.0s	310.0	 And that's what I consider my job to be. To teach people how to communicate with their dog. It's not about teaching sit or stay or come when called or any of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvt57v0EdHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=638&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 It's about how to understand our dogs on a case by case, an individual basis. Anyway, if you're liking these videos, make sure you're subscribed.
