https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=15.8s	15.8	 Not only will the book walk you through everything you need to know to raise the best dog possible,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=20.8s	20.8	 wherever you see this play button there will be a corresponding video on my website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=24.8s	24.8	 If you want to reduce some of the chaos you might be going through with a new dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=27.8s	27.8	 you can start by setting up automatic pet food delivery at Pet Flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=31.5s	31.5	 There's really nothing to it at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 Choose your favorite brand of dog food and how often you want it to be delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=36.4s	36.4	 Plus, Pet Flow has excellent customer service on helping you find the right dog food for your dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Plus, I think it's important to support companies that do not sell training tools that are specifically designed to train with pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=54.1s	54.1	 Support ethical companies and make your life easier at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 There's more to having a well adjusted dog than you might imagine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 Preparing your family or roommates for a new dog, especially a puppy, can throw everyone a little off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=66.7s	66.7	 Start preparing yourself mentally for a potentially challenging few months and maybe a little bit less sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=71.7s	71.7	 Your pup has a lot to learn and their life is changing fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=75.8s	75.8	 It's critical that everyone is on the same page when it comes to interacting with a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 In general, I recommend choosing a lead trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 Now, parents of young children, I understand you might be tempted to delegate this to the kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=86.9s	86.9	 However, it should be you as teaching a dog effectively does require some maturity, know how and life experience that many young kids just don't yet have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=95.5s	95.5	 As the main trainer gets a feel for how to interact with a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=98.5s	98.5	 they in turn can then teach other members of the household how to connect with the dog a little bit more consistently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=103.9s	103.9	 If you do elect to have two lead trainers in the house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=106.6s	106.6	 say in the case of a couple or a mother and a teenager who really want to be involved with the dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=111.4s	111.4	 it's imperative that you're both very consistent and that one person doesn't say tolerate exuberant jumping or begging while the other person wants these behaviors prohibited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=120.6s	120.6	 You should have a conversation really early on as to what will be acceptable and what won't be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=124.8s	124.8	 And this will, of course, vary from family to family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 But what about introductions to friends, family and other pets?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=131.3s	131.3	 At first, it's expected that young children will be super excited and really eager to interact with a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=136.5s	136.5	 Your job as the main trainer is to make this a positive experience all around for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=140.9s	140.9	 And also make sure that you have a leash on your dog when meeting your kids at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=144.8s	144.8	 In order to make sure that those first few introductions between your kids and the new dog go really well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=149.7s	149.7	 have your child toss treats towards your dog and encourage the dog to come to your child rather than having your child approach the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 Teach your kids to be gentle, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=158.4s	158.4	 Let your children know about respecting the dog's space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=160.9s	160.9	 especially when the dog is eating, as many new dogs might be protective of their food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 Never leave a young child unattended with a dog either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=168.4s	168.4	 When introducing your new dog to other pets, keep those first few interactions really controlled and really brief
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=174.1s	174.1	 because all of the animals in the house need time to adjust to one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1ezr0is_c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=515&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 I'll have a more detailed video in the description that will show you how to introduce your dog to other family pets.
