https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Lots of people wonder how often they should train their dogs and how long each training session should last.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=5.1s	5.1	 But the answer isn't quite so...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 Black and white.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 What's black and white and cute all over?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=10.3s	10.3	 It's you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=11.2s	11.2	 Today, Ollie and I are gonna shed some light on the situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=13.8s	13.8	 Click thumbs up, subscribe to my channel, hey, and if you've got a puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 my book will help you tie in my YouTube videos more efficiently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=20.6s	20.6	 When training your dog, you have to have an amazing currency for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=23.7s	23.7	 Woof!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 That's how you bark?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 Today I'm using these dehydrated turkey dog treats from Open Farm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=28.3s	28.3	 Let's see what Ollie thinks of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 I'd say that he likes them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=30.9s	30.9	 Ollie, you can't just...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 I really love that Open Farm is ultra-transparent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=35.3s	35.3	 and committed to the responsible, sustainable, and humane production of their super premium dog foods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=40.8s	40.8	 Get this, the meat in their food is made with the highest quality human-grade meat from family farms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 The same exact meat that you find at high-end grocers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 and that's true of every one of their recipes in their dog foods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=52.4s	52.4	 So no low-quality meats, no by-products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 That's important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=56.1s	56.1	 And they're the first certified humane pet food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 Every animal is raised in comfortable conditions where they can live natural, stress-free lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=63.7s	63.7	 They want to empower you to know exactly where your dog's food is coming from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=67.7s	67.7	 You can trace every ingredient in your bag of Open Farm back to the source
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 using their What's in Your Bag feature on their website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 All you do is enter this lot code.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=75.7s	75.7	 I'm gonna have a link where you can check them out in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 Before I answer how often you should train your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 there's some things you need to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 Whoa, don't fall!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=83.2s	83.2	 Broadly speaking, there are two main types of training sessions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 primary and secondary sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=88.4s	88.4	 For a primary training session, you should be completely focused on your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=92.3s	92.3	 and work on teaching them something like sit, lie down, or stay, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=96.4s	96.4	 For primary training sessions, you should use really good treats for your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=99.9s	99.9	 something like real chicken or real high-end dog treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 And these turkey treats that I'm using today from Open Farm are fantastic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=105.9s	105.9	 because they break up just perfectly so that I can get lots of use out of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 The trick is your dog needs to love the treat, not just like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 These training sessions can last anywhere between a few seconds and 30 or 40 minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 depending on what you're teaching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 Of course, your dog is gonna have some say in how long these training sessions last, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 If you're a beginner and you don't have a lot of experience teaching dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 it's a good idea to focus on primary training for 10 minutes at a time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 as a general rule of thumb and do this very, very often throughout the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 with a heavy emphasis on practicing in lots of different environments over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 So I'm gonna give Ollie my full attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=140.1s	140.1	 and we're gonna see if we can get him rolling over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 So first, we'll need to get him into a down, which he's excelling at, doing a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 Now I'm gonna focus on luring him into a standard rollover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=150.6s	150.6	 But again, I'm not being passive here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 I'm not asking him to do it in a crazy environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=154.9s	154.9	 I'm just introducing the concept to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=157.5s	157.5	 Look at him, he's a little reluctant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 Right there, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=161.5s	161.5	 This way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 And you can see right there, there's a little bit of frustration settling in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=165.3s	165.3	 because he's like, what do you want me to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 So let me just check here to make sure that he's still pretty willing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 Good, I can get his attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=171.7s	171.7	 And I'm gonna reward him for that just to find reasons to reward him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=174.7s	174.7	 to keep him motivated here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=175.9s	175.9	 Getting to know your dog and being able to read their signs of frustration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=178.8s	178.8	 and also learning to read your signs of frustration is really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=183.2s	183.2	 It's best to end a training session before that occurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=186.2s	186.2	 Let's try the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 Maybe he's more comfortable doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=189.7s	189.7	 Good, come on, lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=194.5s	194.5	 There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=195.4s	195.4	 Yeah, that's called a rollover if I've ever seen one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=198.2s	198.2	 You can see how you have to be hyper-focused on your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 during these primary training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=202.4s	202.4	 He's starting to get it, wouldn't you say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=204.3s	204.3	 That was a beautiful rollover, sir.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=206.1s	206.1	 Primary training sessions are great for laying really good groundwork
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=209.5s	209.5	 with your dog, but secondary training sessions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 that's where the real magic happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=213.9s	213.9	 Secondary training sessions are a little bit less intuitive at first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 but you'll quickly find out why they're absolutely mandatory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=220.8s	220.8	 and why they'll make you a better trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=222.7s	222.7	 A secondary training session is more of an impromptu training lesson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=226.1s	226.1	 that you jump into whenever a real-life training opportunity presents itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=230.4s	230.4	 For example, you know how sometimes you put fried chicken on the floor like you do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=233.8s	233.8	 and then you forget about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=234.9s	234.9	 and then your dog is left with this amazing temptation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 while your attention is elsewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 That's when we stop what we're doing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=241.1s	241.1	 intervene to get his attention on us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 and then show him what we prefer he do instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=245.8s	245.8	 It's as though primary training sessions give your dog some foundation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 but secondary training sessions are what allow you to introduce context
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 so that your dog understands how to behave in a multitude of scenarios.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=256.9s	256.9	 If your dog has a habit of jumping on furniture like Ollie does,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=260.1s	260.1	 redirecting can be a fabulous way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 to show them how you'd prefer they behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=264.3s	264.3	 Look at that. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=266.7s	266.7	 The common question I get here is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=268.3s	268.3	 aren't you rewarding the dog for jumping on the furniture?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 But did you notice what I did at the end?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 He was up here, I redirected him over here to pay attention to me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=276.8s	276.8	 asked him to sit, he did so, and I rewarded him for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=280.4s	280.4	 So I was actually rewarding him for paying attention to me and sitting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=283.7s	283.7	 He might be about to... Okay, see? Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=287.1s	287.1	 I'm gonna just redirect him over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=288.7s	288.7	 Come on. Over here, buddy. Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=290.8s	290.8	 If you come over here, you'll get rewarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=292.4s	292.4	 Now, will you pay attention to me? Sit. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=295.4s	295.4	 And let's do a little bit of proofing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=296.7s	296.7	 Let me put a treat up here and see if that tempts him to get up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=299.4s	299.4	 To be clear, this isn't something you do five or six times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=302.1s	302.1	 As you can see, you have to keep doing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=304.7s	304.7	 in order for your dog to really understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=306.9s	306.9	 Now, it might be tempting to just pull them down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=308.6s	308.6	 or pick them up and put them down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=310.4s	310.4	 but honestly, you're not really motivating your dog to learn if you do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 And this is just part of having a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=315.7s	315.7	 Ollie, you're a mess, buddy. Looks like we have a new host.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=319.2s	319.2	 Come on, let's go this way. Good?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=322.8s	322.8	 Very good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=324.1s	324.1	 And of course, you know, redirecting combined with doing a good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=327.2s	327.2	 of controlling your dog's environment is the path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=330.0s	330.0	 to really get some traction on most of your beginner training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=332.8s	332.8	 Look at all these good treats. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=336.7s	336.7	 He's not ready to quite abandon it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=338.1s	338.1	 He's like, I haven't forgotten about those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=343.8s	343.8	 And see, right here, this is how you really teach your dog to think here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=347.4s	347.4	 You can see how he's going back and forth between the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=349.6s	349.6	 I planted up there and the treats that I'm offering him over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=353.9s	353.9	 Yes. Sit, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=357.7s	357.7	 Good work. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=359.8s	359.8	 And it might seem a little mean to put treats up on the furniture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=362.6s	362.6	 It's better to set up those training sessions sometimes too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=365.8s	365.8	 than it is to just wait for them to occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=367.8s	367.8	 Of course, that would be more of a primary training session than a secondary one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=371.3s	371.3	 But no, over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=372.9s	372.9	 Yeah. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=379.9s	379.9	 Sit. Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=382.6s	382.6	 Good work. Really prioritize getting good at redirecting your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 because it's one of the most powerful ways to guide your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=388.9s	388.9	 in spontaneous real life situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=391.7s	391.7	 However, if you find yourself redirecting your dog constantly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=395.1s	395.1	 this likely means that you're not optimally controlling the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 Now, since secondary training sessions are a bit more spontaneous,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=402.1s	402.1	 you should have treats scattered all around the house and containers like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=405.3s	405.3	 at all times so that you can easily get to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=408.3s	408.3	 when you need to get to treats quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=410.4s	410.4	 These treats should be soft and very tasty and keep well at room temperature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=415.2s	415.2	 The reason is secondary training sessions often require you to burst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=418.9s	418.9	 into training mode and you need to have your dog's currency quickly available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=423.3s	423.3	 The bottom line is if you have a dog, especially a puppy like Ali,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=426.7s	426.7	 virtually all of the time that you do have available with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=430.2s	430.2	 should be dedicated to some type of training job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=433.6s	433.6	 See that he started to jump on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=435.5s	435.5	 I jumped into training mode, redirected him into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=438.7s	438.7	 How about we get a lie down to and a stay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=442.2s	442.2	 Look at me. Yes. Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=445.8s	445.8	 So maybe that's teaching your dog how to mellow out and go to sleep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=448.4s	448.4	 while you're just on the Internet or teaching them how to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=451.2s	451.2	 when you spontaneously throw a toy in front of them to prepare them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=454.3s	454.3	 for future distraction training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=455.9s	455.9	 Now, my book Playing with Your Dog definitely counts as quality training time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=459.9s	459.9	 because it's teaching them one of the most valuable lessons of all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=463.5s	463.5	 how to focus on you and engage with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=466.0s	466.0	 And that is my absolute favorite type of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=469.3s	469.3	 If you're wondering how many things can you teach your dog at one time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=471.9s	471.9	 I'm going to have a link in the description with Louis the Cavalier,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7cpYSmA0c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=472&pp=iAQB&t=481.3s	481.3	 Make sure you're subscribed to my channel.
