https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today's episode of the Dog Training Revolution is crowdfunded by you and sponsored by Petflow.com.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 In today's episode of the Dog Training Revolution, we're going to be going over ways to prepare your dog when you're planning on adding a new member to your family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 Arden and Catherine are expecting a new baby boy and they want to make sure they're doing everything possible to ensure that their dog Sadie, the Shepherd Lab mix, is comfortable with their new son, Caden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 Make sure you click thumbs up to let me know you're enjoying the videos and that you want to see more of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 Also, like me on Facebook and of course, make sure you're subscribed so you see all of my future videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 Now, you know, many of us have very busy lives that makes getting to the store kind of challenging in order to get our dog food every two or three weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 Petflow.com will change your life because instead of running to the store every time you run out of food, it is there when you need it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 All you have to do is select the food you want and how often you want it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 Now, of course, you can edit or cancel this at any time for any reason at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 But understand this. When you get your dog food through Petflow.com slash Zach George, you're not just saving time and money.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 You're endorsing the evolution of modern ethical dog training, too. Enter code Zach 20 when you check out and you'll get 20 percent off of your first order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 Now, let's go say hello to Arden Catherine and their dog Sadie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 Arden Catherine, I've had the honor of working with you guys with Sadie a few times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 And I got to say you've done an incredible job with her. You guys are really in tune. Congratulations on your new baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 How much longer until you're due?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 Really could be any day now, any time between now and the next two weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 This is great. I love this here. And this is actually quite smart. This is a baby. Have you really taken this seriously?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 We certainly have. We would cradle the baby like it was our own. We'd walk around the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 We even downloaded a little phone app that makes a bunch of random crying noises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 While holding a baby and using the crying app here, it can really help a lot to initially prepare them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 But having an actual human being in your arms that has smells, that has unpredictable behavior, lots of different frequencies when they're crying and making sounds, that's still a completely different level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 You've also made an effort to bring her around lots of kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 We have. One of my great friends brought his six-month-old over a couple of months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 Sadie did great. The trials that we've had have been rather perfect circumstances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 And there's always that unexpected, you know, something falls on the floor or something runs out in front of Sadie and distracts her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 So those are the things that we really need to prepare for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 We don't want to underestimate how much changing a huge variable like bringing another person into the house can throw a dog off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 It's very important to have very tight, fluid communication with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 For you guys at home, you'll want to make sure that you've taught your dog all the basics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 Now, I'll have a link that'll show you how to teach your dog all the basics in order so that you can get prepared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 That should take anywhere between six and 12 weeks, depending on a variety of factors and where you are with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 So there's plenty of time for most people to prepare for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 How is she with jumping on you? Because obviously that's a pretty big deal breaker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 If you're holding a baby, you can't have your dog jumping on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 Sure. She does pretty well with not getting overly anxious and excited when people come in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 If your son, Kaden, is sleeping, you obviously don't want her barking, waking him up a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 So it's important that you have general barking under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 But I'll have videos on jumping and barking also in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=223.0s	223.0	 You want to break this down into two major phases, by and large, for most dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 The first phase, which we're going to focus on today, is teaching your dog how to just chill out and relax so that you can tend to your baby and do whatever you need to at will without interference from your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 The second phase is then introducing your dog to your baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 There should be no urgency to have them interact immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 Sadie's energy level is moderate, so exercise before training isn't required here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 But if your dog is a high-energy dog, you'll need to exercise them sufficiently before teaching this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 Fetch is generally the most efficient way to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 See the description if you need to know how to teach or improve your dog's fetch ability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 Let's see where Sadie is on stay while unexpectedly distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 That way we can see where we need to start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 What I'd like to see initially here is kind of how Sadie reacts if we really sell her, at least try and sell her, on the fact that this is a real baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=281.0s	281.0	 You're just being a distracting dad. You've got...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 And if you drop some of this, let's see how she does as you're walking around with the baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=288.0s	288.0	 She's really interested in you because there's a lot of action going on over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=293.0s	293.0	 Really good down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 Okay, so she's got that, but with the distraction she gets thrown up a little.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 It's like a lot of dogs. She's like, whoa, okay, this is a little bit harder, especially if you're going to throw a chicken on the ground and make sounds with a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 That's interesting to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 So we have to show her that she still needs to stay no matter how much she wants to get up and investigate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 When you're teaching your dog something like this, it's best to phase things in slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 You want to take baby steps, so to speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=317.0s	317.0	 You don't want to just wait for your new baby to come and hope everything goes all right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 I think we should work with her for a few more minutes on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 Have her relax into a down stay and chill on the couch right here while she does that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 That's what we want to be able to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=330.0s	330.0	 What I'd like to do next is to have you just walk around with only the baby for a second while she holds a down stay and make sure we've got that solid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=336.0s	336.0	 And then we'll change another variable on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=338.0s	338.0	 This is awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=340.0s	340.0	 She's holding a down stay while he holds a baby doll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 Our next step is to do the same thing, holding the baby and rattling the toy, maybe even dropping the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 So now we're doing two things, walking around with the baby, making a sound with the toy, expecting her to hold her down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=354.0s	354.0	 You can see she's got, look right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=356.0s	356.0	 That's X. Oh, nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 Get her eyes on you when you drop it next time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=360.0s	360.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 So she's looking at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 Now I want her looking at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=363.0s	363.0	 For guidance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=365.0s	365.0	 Why don't you try and make some sounds, maybe even whistle a little bit to see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=369.0s	369.0	 So stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=370.0s	370.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=371.0s	371.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 Now try to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=374.0s	374.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=377.0s	377.0	 So I think we're making a lot of progress right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 She's staying when you hold the baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 She's staying when you rattle the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=382.0s	382.0	 She's staying when you whistle, which she's normally thrown off by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 Now comes the real test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 Will she stay as you do all of that while you also drop chicken?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=391.0s	391.0	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=392.0s	392.0	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 You see this?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 That's progress.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 We're not going to accomplish things when teaching dogs in one big step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=406.0s	406.0	 You have to really break them down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=408.0s	408.0	 That's what you're seeing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 Sadie was trying, but she was having a hard time grasping that she should stay while Arden

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=414.0s	414.0	 When we teach our dogs, we need to make it a priority to anticipate how they're likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 to act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=419.0s	419.0	 In this case, we have Sadie breaking stay at around the same point in the exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 Since she is predictably breaking stay there, you'll want to come up and reward her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=427.0s	427.0	 So in other words, you'll sit down and then get right back up and reward her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=431.0s	431.0	 You know what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=432.0s	432.0	 Don't stall out too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=433.0s	433.0	 When your dog is repeatedly making the same mistake, you need to work through this by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 taking a step back on your training to help your dog understand a bit more clearly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=441.0s	441.0	 Stay there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=442.0s	442.0	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=444.0s	444.0	 Sit down slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 Tell her to stay again if you need to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=446.0s	446.0	 Stay there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=447.0s	447.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=448.0s	448.0	 Stay there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=449.0s	449.0	 Now whistle briefly, but tell her to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=452.0s	452.0	 See how we're going in slow motion, really not trying to throw her in the deep end and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=458.0s	458.0	 really overwhelm her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=459.0s	459.0	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=461.0s	461.0	 Be very clear about leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=462.0s	462.0	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=466.0s	466.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=468.0s	468.0	 Now look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=469.0s	469.0	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=471.0s	471.0	 That's what I'm talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=473.0s	473.0	 Do you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=474.0s	474.0	 This is an exercise you've got to practice a lot over a good few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=482.0s	482.0	 The next step is when you see her naturally relaxing in day to day life where she's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=487.0s	487.0	 hanging out while you're doing whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=489.0s	489.0	 You want to start to teach her how to do that when you ask her to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 That's called a settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=494.0s	494.0	 A settle is basically a down stay where a dog relaxes indefinitely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=499.0s	499.0	 So it's different from a down stay because when you ask your dog to lie down and stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=503.0s	503.0	 it means lie down, stay and wait for the next thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=506.0s	506.0	 Settle means lie down and relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 And when I get to you, I'll get to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=510.0s	510.0	 This is what a settle looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=512.0s	512.0	 So you would come up to her and you would say settle, relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=516.0s	516.0	 You're not rewarding with food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=518.0s	518.0	 You'd rather just kind of communicating to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=520.0s	520.0	 I like the calm behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=521.0s	521.0	 This is what we dog trainers call capturing a behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=524.0s	524.0	 When she does this naturally, you'll want to let her know how much you like the calm behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=528.0s	528.0	 Over several weeks of doing this, you'll be able to eventually say, hey Sadie, settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=532.0s	532.0	 The tricky thing about teaching a settle is that you're not rewarding the position they're in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=537.0s	537.0	 but rather their relaxed state of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=539.0s	539.0	 Pardon, I think you're doing totally awesome with Sadie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=541.0s	541.0	 She's a remarkable dog and I think she's going to be totally fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=545.0s	545.0	 Just be really consistent with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIJpLQrKGPo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=546.0s	546.0	 I'm so excited for you guys.
