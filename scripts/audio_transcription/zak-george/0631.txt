https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=83.1s	83.1	 And by the way, in my classes, we don't use dog treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=85.3s	85.3	 We use real turkey meat.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=97.8s	97.8	 It's very important not to ask a dog to learn new concepts while in that mindset.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 Can I try and get a bit closer to him?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=192.6s	192.6	 Sure enough, he started to brighten up a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=194.9s	194.9	 Even let me scratch under his chin.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=200.2s	200.2	 He's interacting with me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 he's saying, I won't even interact with you and play this game with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 I'm trying to play fetch at fairly short range with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=211.7s	211.7	 I'm trying to get him comfortable interacting with me at a closer range.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMRsUnYezY8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=632&pp=iAQB&t=243.4s	243.4	 The best way you're going to get your dog comfortable in various environments is working
