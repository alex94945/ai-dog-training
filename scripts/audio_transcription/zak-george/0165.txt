https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Right now George is currently getting posted. We're filming Chop and we're casting for the next series, which I think is going to be a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 We're going to a place where I heard there are 20 rescue homeless puppies needing homes. If we're going to a place with 20 puppies, I have to show you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 What if we did a series where we cast all of them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Please!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 Really? Come on, not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 Okay, I can't. Not happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 These puppies are from multiple litters and they get flown into this rescue from remote isolated villages throughout Alaska.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 I want to get to know as many of these puppies as I can. I mean, each and every one of them are incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 But we're looking for a certain something to stick out to us for the star of this series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 Oh my gosh, look at your eyes. You look ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 One of the things I look for when I'm looking at puppies, I mean, I personally love a dog that likes to play and interact with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 So far she's ticking that box, but so little.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 Look at this dog. Often for a lot of people, a lower energy puppy is probably more ideal than a higher energy one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 The advantage with lower energy dogs is they're more likely to just chill and give you your space and not require maybe as much attention as a higher energy dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 I just can't stop thinking about how brave that tiniest puppy was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 I mean, I'm watching her. She's basically getting trampled by all of these bigger dogs and she seems really resilient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 I mean, who doesn't love an underdog? She's literally under a lot of dogs right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 So I wanted to have one more look at her. Oh my gosh. Hello. Hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 Oh, she's adorable. I like her energy so much. I think this would be my choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 I'm Zach George. This is my wife, Bri, and our dog, Inertia. And this is Biscuit, the rescue dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 She's only 13 weeks old and completely untrained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 I teach dogs and I teach people how to teach their dogs using the most modern dog behavior science,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 which shows us that using frequent corrections when training our dogs only holds us back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 So I'll have to keep Biscuit's loving training for maximum results in the weeks ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 But look, just because it's more effective doesn't mean it's magic. And my plans don't always go as intended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 Not only does Biscuit have to learn all of her basics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 but she has to get properly socialized in order to be prepared for her new life ahead in this magical place known as Alaska.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 You're not going to want to miss a single episode. Subscribe and click the bell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 This is Reality Dog Training, Biscuit's Edition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 We are picking up Biscuit's and I already know that going into this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 one of my very, very top priorities is going to be getting potty training and house training under control as soon as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 How long do you think it'll be until there's a potty accident?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 Really? Because she's not potty trained at all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 Nope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when and how much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 Okay, so I have video evidence...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Oh no!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 ...that the best intentions alone...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 Are you serious?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 ...are not enough to potty train a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 Oh God!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 But I'm getting ahead of myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 The first thing I do with any new puppy is show them where to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 So we got a potty area out here for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 Gonna let her smell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 By the way, you hear that wind?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 Here in the Alaskan Chugach Mountains, the winds can be insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 Good girl! Oh, that's a pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 Good girl!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 Okay!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 Our neighbors stopped by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 We got a big windstorm coming tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 It might be a big one, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 Oh yeah, and he dropped off some moose bones too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 Our hunting group got two moose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 Well, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 That's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 Alaska is truly a different world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 I have a feeling this is going to be a very eventful first 24 hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 Biscuits appears to be a little extra reserved,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 or even nervous upon first coming into our house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 I know Inertia just adores puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 I think it's time to give them a quick introduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 to help biscuits feel a little more at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 But I'm gonna start small.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=242.0s	242.0	 I want to keep this first introduction nice and brief.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 And as expected, Inertia is very excited to meet biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 But I'm still gonna remind her to be gentle and not overly playful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=251.0s	251.0	 After all, she's had some much rougher playmates very recently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 with our other foster dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 Being sweet. Who's a sweet girl?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 But Inertia's doing wonderful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 Look at her. She's being very polite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 She's sniffing and then backing off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 And she appears to intentionally not be overwhelming biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 And biscuits is looking a little bit more curious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 and I know she's in good hands with Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 So I'll put her down to see how she feels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 Biscuits is a little hesitant, but I think they'll open up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 This is just a lot for biscuits to take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=281.0s	281.0	 You can see how she's up here, and that's fine for now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 She's curious, but she's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 I don't know this dog. That's pretty good, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 It's clear to me that Inertia is eager to engage in play,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 but biscuits isn't quite feeling it yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 And that's natural.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 It is a lot to take in from biscuits' perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=301.0s	301.0	 So I'm going to put Inertia up and give biscuits some space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=304.0s	304.0	 to let her absorb all of what's going on here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 I think we're just going to give her a little bit of time to unwind out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=310.0s	310.0	 The thing is, normally you say we should attach her with a leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 but she's never worn one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 She's never worn a harness or a leash to my knowledge at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=317.0s	317.0	 Obviously introducing a leash and a harness and a collar are high on my priority list,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=322.0s	322.0	 but there's a different trick in my toolbox
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 that might actually help me get some sleep tonight too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 Before we go any further, I want to teach biscuits her very first word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 Let me teach her the word yes before I introduce her to her new crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=336.0s	336.0	 Yes is such a great word to train a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 Since we know positive reinforcement can be so effective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 we want to find ways to say yes and follow it up with something our dog likes as often as we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 To teach her yes, all I'm doing is saying yes when she looks at me or pays attention to me in any way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 The key is I'm trying to mark the exact moment she does something I like by saying the word yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=359.0s	359.0	 And literally every single time I say yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 I'm going to attempt to follow it up with something that biscuits really likes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 And she appears to like food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=368.0s	368.0	 So I'll be using her meals to train her quite a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=371.0s	371.0	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 Just because she turned to my direction is why I said yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 I gave her the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 So you can see how this might be really powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 If you can let your dog know what you like in really strong terms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=384.0s	384.0	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 You discover that they are looking for ways to make you say yes so they can get whatever it is they're interested in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=392.0s	392.0	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 Oh, I love that she responded to that noise I made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 I definitely want to mark that and reward that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 And so as long as I'm consistent, it really is a good way to start building communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 I really want to minimize or even do my best to eliminate correcting where possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 I'm getting a good feeling about this girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=410.0s	410.0	 I think she's really getting the point with yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=413.0s	413.0	 I think she's going to start to understand what that means in context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 And I think we can start right now with this transformer crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 I mean, honestly, this is the most unusual innovative crate I have ever seen in my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=424.0s	424.0	 I'm going slow because she's never seen this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=427.0s	427.0	 So I want to make sure that she doesn't get nervous of a moving part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=430.0s	430.0	 But look at this!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=432.0s	432.0	 Crates can be an amazing way to manage your dog's environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=436.0s	436.0	 which is a key part of raising a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 On one very important condition,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=441.0s	441.0	 and that is that they really enjoy the crate, that they like being in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=448.0s	448.0	 Snaps up like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=449.0s	449.0	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 Why am I saying yes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=452.0s	452.0	 She was so brave around the door going up for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=456.0s	456.0	 This is a very straightforward exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=458.0s	458.0	 To get started, I'm just going to toss some treats into her crate and encourage her to go in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=462.0s	462.0	 There's another door here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=464.0s	464.0	 See how she comes right back out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=466.0s	466.0	 Let's see if we can get her voluntarily staying in there for a little bit longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=471.0s	471.0	 This is fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 So you can see here, look at her overall body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=474.0s	474.0	 She seems interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=476.0s	476.0	 She's alert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=477.0s	477.0	 Her tail is up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=478.0s	478.0	 Her eyes are bright.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=480.0s	480.0	 Now I want to see if she'll go in all on her own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=482.0s	482.0	 When she does, then I'll toss in the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=486.0s	486.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=487.0s	487.0	 See the hesitancy before she came out there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=490.0s	490.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=491.0s	491.0	 I want to catch her succeeding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 That's what we mean by positive reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=495.0s	495.0	 Rather than saying no, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=497.0s	497.0	 When she comes out, we catch her doing the right thing and say yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=502.0s	502.0	 Right there and really try and burn it in her brain with her lunch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=505.0s	505.0	 Let's see what happens if we go ahead and close one door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=508.0s	508.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=510.0s	510.0	 I want her to get experience seeing the door close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=514.0s	514.0	 Seeing it open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=516.0s	516.0	 All right, so she's doing a little...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=519.0s	519.0	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=520.0s	520.0	 She got a little hesitant there when I closed the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=522.0s	522.0	 Whenever you notice your puppy looking a little hesitant or unsure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=525.0s	525.0	 it's really best to take the time to give them a more positive association right away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=530.0s	530.0	 You can do that by going at your puppy's pace and not rushing them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=534.0s	534.0	 and pairing every potentially scary experience with lots of great treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=539.0s	539.0	 All right, so far so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=541.0s	541.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=543.0s	543.0	 See, I'm trying to override that instinct to come out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=545.0s	545.0	 because her desire is to come back to me and look for more food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=548.0s	548.0	 You notice how the metal on this is diagonal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=551.0s	551.0	 This diamond-shaped pattern isn't just for looks, though I do like the looks of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=554.0s	554.0	 It actually helps prevent injury to a dog's jaws or their paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=558.0s	558.0	 It's very clear that safety was of the utmost importance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=562.0s	562.0	 when they were designing this crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=564.0s	564.0	 It's not often you see a major change in the design of crates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=567.0s	567.0	 but I think Diggs really nailed this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=569.0s	569.0	 If you guys want to try the crate, I'm going to have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=571.0s	571.0	 Okay, we're getting somewhere with biscuits crate training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=574.0s	574.0	 but it's definitely too premature to declare victory just yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=578.0s	578.0	 Puppies need a lot of rest throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=580.0s	580.0	 Biscuits has had a pretty long day so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=582.0s	582.0	 So I'm going to try to shift my strategy and use this nap to my advantage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=587.0s	587.0	 What if we made it more inviting by putting a bed in it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=590.0s	590.0	 What do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=591.0s	591.0	 We have an extra bed lying around here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=593.0s	593.0	 It's one fluffy bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=595.0s	595.0	 I like that I have the option to be able to put my hand in here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=599.0s	599.0	 to encourage her to come in like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=601.0s	601.0	 I'm going to go ahead and throw some beef jerky in there as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=604.0s	604.0	 This is dog beef jerky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=605.0s	605.0	 Let me just let her think about it and see if she goes in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=607.0s	607.0	 Ideally, it would be good if she went in there, started chewing on it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=610.0s	610.0	 while I left the door open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=612.0s	612.0	 Okay, I see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=614.0s	614.0	 It's like that, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=616.0s	616.0	 Ooh, easy there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=619.0s	619.0	 Did you hear that growling right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=622.0s	622.0	 You definitely need to address that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=624.0s	624.0	 This is a high value thing to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=626.0s	626.0	 We'll have a lesson around that at some other point here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=628.0s	628.0	 Good. Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=630.0s	630.0	 There she goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=632.0s	632.0	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=633.0s	633.0	 I'm going to let her come right back out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=634.0s	634.0	 So there is a chew in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=635.0s	635.0	 She knows it's there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=636.0s	636.0	 My guess is she'll go back and investigate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=638.0s	638.0	 I've got both doors open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=640.0s	640.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=641.0s	641.0	 I'm kind of freaking out a little bit, Bree, about the crate training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=644.0s	644.0	 because I have to sleep tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=646.0s	646.0	 Do you see how she's falling asleep naturally?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=648.0s	648.0	 I was thinking maybe we could, once she falls asleep, gently place her in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=652.0s	652.0	 This is a dog training hack that we learned with our puppy Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=655.0s	655.0	 If you can catch your puppy taking a good nap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=658.0s	658.0	 and then gently move them into their crate while they're sleeping and unconscious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=662.0s	662.0	 you can set them up to wake up feeling comfy and relaxed inside their crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=667.0s	667.0	 The more literal minutes that I can have her spend in that crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=671.0s	671.0	 while she's not feeling stressed out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=673.0s	673.0	 the more likely it is she'll come to accept being in her crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=676.0s	676.0	 I don't know how to get out of here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=678.0s	678.0	 I don't know either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=680.0s	680.0	 Hypothesis supported so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=682.0s	682.0	 She's in the crate. She's sleeping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=684.0s	684.0	 I think we go ahead and leave the door open since she's asleep anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=689.0s	689.0	 So if she does wake up, she can come out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=691.0s	691.0	 But I really just want to slowly get her comfortable spending time in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=695.0s	695.0	 because we still have a little while until bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=697.0s	697.0	 And so this is a really great way to gently introduce the crate to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=703.0s	703.0	 I imagine she'll wake up shortly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=705.0s	705.0	 I probably don't want her sleeping too much because I want to sleep tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=709.0s	709.0	 I'm going to sleep in the bedroom, I hope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=711.0s	711.0	 Hopefully she'll just be like this and sleep through the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=713.0s	713.0	 And if I can steal eight hours overnight with her being comfortable and stress free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=717.0s	717.0	 while she sleeps in her crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=718.0s	718.0	 that's eight more hours in her cumulative bank of experience of relaxed, positive crate time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=724.0s	724.0	 But there's one kind of major complication with my plans to have Biscuit sleep through the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=730.0s	730.0	 That major windstorm is still headed our way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=733.0s	733.0	 And Alaska does not do weather in moderation at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=737.0s	737.0	 Even Biscuit's notices that there's something very off and different about the weather.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=742.0s	742.0	 When we were here over the winter, we had a windstorm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=744.0s	744.0	 I wasn't positive I was going to survive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=748.0s	748.0	 Oh my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=751.0s	751.0	 The glass vibrates. You can see it flexing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=754.0s	754.0	 I might be going in that crate with her to seek refuge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=757.0s	757.0	 The winds are picking up out here, letting the dogs out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=761.0s	761.0	 Watch this classic puppy fake out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=763.0s	763.0	 Biscuits think she's done with her potty break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=766.0s	766.0	 But I'm telling you, that dog is lying to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=769.0s	769.0	 All done? Come on, let's go potty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=773.0s	773.0	 Never trust a puppy. True words.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=776.0s	776.0	 You're such a little dog. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=779.0s	779.0	 Aha, see? That pee could have been in my living room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=783.0s	783.0	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=785.0s	785.0	 I'm feeling pretty good about this potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=787.0s	787.0	 I think it's going to go smoothly, perfectly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=789.0s	789.0	 We may never have a potty accident in the house at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=792.0s	792.0	 Biscuits doesn't have any experience with a collar or a harness yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=796.0s	796.0	 If I approach this too aggressively, I run the serious risk of causing her to be less trusting of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=802.0s	802.0	 Since I only have a few weeks with her, I must avoid as many setbacks as I possibly can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=808.0s	808.0	 But I have to get this collar on her, I have to get this leash and harness on her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=812.0s	812.0	 and I have to do it in a way that gets her to trust me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=815.0s	815.0	 My goal here is to introduce her to this collar and then her harness in a way that doesn't freak her out, hopefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=822.0s	822.0	 All I'm doing is I'm trying to just break this down into a few steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=826.0s	826.0	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=827.0s	827.0	 I think she might think it's a toy immediately, but I don't want her biting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=831.0s	831.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=833.0s	833.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=834.0s	834.0	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=835.0s	835.0	 Why can nothing go smoothly with you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=837.0s	837.0	 It must be a foreign concept to a dog when you try to put something around their neck like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=841.0s	841.0	 See how she backed away there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=842.0s	842.0	 That's not ideal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=843.0s	843.0	 I need to probably go a little bit slower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=845.0s	845.0	 You can see how this might be daunting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=847.0s	847.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=848.0s	848.0	 Being able to touch her with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=849.0s	849.0	 See, just getting her comfortable with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=851.0s	851.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=853.0s	853.0	 She's free to opt out any time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=855.0s	855.0	 And so far she's not opting out, which is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=859.0s	859.0	 There's a little bit of an opt out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=861.0s	861.0	 When a dog opts out, that's usually a sign that we're moving too quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=864.0s	864.0	 So it's important to pay attention to that kind of feedback.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=867.0s	867.0	 I think really she's backing up mainly because she's like, hey, let me grab that toy more than out of fear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=872.0s	872.0	 Let me see what happens if I go ahead and put her whole food bowl there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=875.0s	875.0	 Maybe that'll distract her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=877.0s	877.0	 Oh, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=878.0s	878.0	 Hey, hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=879.0s	879.0	 You did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=880.0s	880.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=881.0s	881.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=882.0s	882.0	 Let's see how she reacts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=883.0s	883.0	 I definitely want to follow it up with some extra rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=885.0s	885.0	 So far so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=886.0s	886.0	 Gosh, she looks so good with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=888.0s	888.0	 But the collar is really just a thing to hold her tag on so that she can be identified if need be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=894.0s	894.0	 So it's time for the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=895.0s	895.0	 I'm just going to let her investigate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=897.0s	897.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=898.0s	898.0	 But I don't want her thinking it's a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=900.0s	900.0	 So hopefully I can get her focused on that food before she starts picking it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=904.0s	904.0	 It's much safer to use a harness with a dog, especially that still pulls on the leash or if they're young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=909.0s	909.0	 So you're not having that extra tension around their neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=912.0s	912.0	 We try to avoid that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=913.0s	913.0	 Let her see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=914.0s	914.0	 Let her smell it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=915.0s	915.0	 Touch under her chin there, not over her head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=918.0s	918.0	 Dogs tend to get a little bit more nervous when you come in over their head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=922.0s	922.0	 So staying beneath their eye line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=924.0s	924.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=925.0s	925.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=926.0s	926.0	 I'm just going to go ahead and give her treats for every non nervous interaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=932.0s	932.0	 She's scratching because there's something new and foreign on her neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=935.0s	935.0	 That's pretty normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=936.0s	936.0	 Some people might be like, come on, just put it on already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=938.0s	938.0	 But really the main reason I'm running through these steps is I think it's a great illustration of how going seemingly slow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=944.0s	944.0	 and putting a bunch of little tiny steps in there can get you to where you want to be faster, even though it seems like, man, that would take much longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=952.0s	952.0	 It actually doesn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=953.0s	953.0	 It actually is quicker to take your time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=955.0s	955.0	 And I'm not going to say that, oh, she's just going to love wearing her harness instantly, but we need to make a good faith effort to make sure she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=961.0s	961.0	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=962.0s	962.0	 I haven't really started former lure training with her at all, but she's yes, she's doing quite well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=969.0s	969.0	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=970.0s	970.0	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=971.0s	971.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=972.0s	972.0	 I can go up and down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=973.0s	973.0	 I'm going to steal it while I'm here because she's doing so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=975.0s	975.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=976.0s	976.0	 And I'm going to continue to follow up with treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=979.0s	979.0	 I did go much quicker that time, didn't I?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=981.0s	981.0	 But she's I mean, I'm just looking at her overall body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=983.0s	983.0	 Her tail is nice and up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=984.0s	984.0	 She's taking treats pretty easily right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=987.0s	987.0	 A nervous dog doesn't always take treats here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=990.0s	990.0	 So there you can see she's getting a little weirded out by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=992.0s	992.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=993.0s	993.0	 So I will take it off just because she did start to get a little nervous there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=996.0s	996.0	 Biting at the harness leash or collar like this is really common with new dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1002.0s	1002.0	 Puppies are curious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1003.0s	1003.0	 They're going to explore things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1004.0s	1004.0	 Wait, wait, what are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1005.0s	1005.0	 Hey, let me see if I can divert her attention onto some new exciting toys in the aim of showing her how to properly behave here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1012.0s	1012.0	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1013.0s	1013.0	 Her natural fetch is looking great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1019.0s	1019.0	 Yeah, good, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1021.0s	1021.0	 I want to keep it that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1022.0s	1022.0	 So I'm going to play a little tug with her when she brings it to me, let her win a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1026.0s	1026.0	 This is the two month pup box and they know exactly what we need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1029.0s	1029.0	 This nylon bone came in our pup box as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1032.0s	1032.0	 There's still one more thing that we have to introduce to make sure we can manage her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1035.0s	1035.0	 And that is her leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1037.0s	1037.0	 Probably the most important management tool of all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1040.0s	1040.0	 Same thing with the leash here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1042.0s	1042.0	 Just let her know it's here rather than surprise her with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1045.0s	1045.0	 Let her feel the buckle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1047.0s	1047.0	 So she knows what that's like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1048.0s	1048.0	 She's so excited by the bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1050.0s	1050.0	 And this is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1051.0s	1051.0	 This is exactly where I want her when I'm training her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1053.0s	1053.0	 I want her in this like curious, happy state of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1057.0s	1057.0	 Let her see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1059.0s	1059.0	 Tap her with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1060.0s	1060.0	 You can see she's reacting normal there, very interested in the stuff around her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1064.0s	1064.0	 We do this because some dogs will immediately freak out the second they feel tension that they realize they're restrained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1070.0s	1070.0	 And if we can avoid that, that's only going to work to our advantage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 I've attached it to her harness here and I'm sure we're going to see some leash biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1077.0s	1077.0	 But this is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1078.0s	1078.0	 So I'm going to let her run around with the leash attached to her rather than guiding her immediately, getting her comfortable with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1084.0s	1084.0	 I'm doing that to avoid tension for just a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1087.0s	1087.0	 And then I'm going to introduce tension on the leash very delicately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1091.0s	1091.0	 Little tension there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1092.0s	1092.0	 And then I dropped it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1093.0s	1093.0	 She did well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1094.0s	1094.0	 If a dog was like, whoa, what was that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1095.0s	1095.0	 Then that would tell me, OK, slow down, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1097.0s	1097.0	 So what happens here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1098.0s	1098.0	 Because they're OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1099.0s	1099.0	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1100.0s	1100.0	 That's her first time like running and feeling the tension of the leash right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1104.0s	1104.0	 And she doesn't appear to be perceiving it as something that is aversive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1108.0s	1108.0	 I want her focused on me up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1110.0s	1110.0	 This is actually technically her first leash walking lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1113.0s	1113.0	 And if you've got a puppy, remember, Pup Box is going to send you items based on your dog's specific age, which will help keep your training on track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1120.0s	1120.0	 What really differentiates Pup Box is that they send you this really detailed training card with a ton of advice centered around your puppy every single month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1128.0s	1128.0	 And you can get 50 percent off your first Pup Box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1130.0s	1130.0	 I'll have a link and discount code below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1132.0s	1132.0	 OK, so now I have possession of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1135.0s	1135.0	 I can attach her to my belt loop or my belt if I need to while I'm around the house or to let her drag with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1140.0s	1140.0	 So if she does start to get away from me, she's a lot easier to get to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1143.0s	1143.0	 Or if she runs under the couch, she's still a lot easier to get to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1147.0s	1147.0	 Of course, that is something I need to be aware of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1149.0s	1149.0	 Leash biting is an inevitable part of puppyhood for a lot of puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1155.0s	1155.0	 So I'm just going to focus on giving her the appropriate thing to bite on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1160.0s	1160.0	 Thank you, Pup Box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1161.0s	1161.0	 And I need to do that consistently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1163.0s	1163.0	 It's not like you just do that four times and then your dog understands you kind of have to do it 400 times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1169.0s	1169.0	 But they'll get it eventually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1171.0s	1171.0	 Biscuits is well rested and she's had some time to adapt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1174.0s	1174.0	 Let's give Biscuits and Inertia another chance at playing together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1177.0s	1177.0	 Oh, this might be their first time playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1180.0s	1180.0	 Puppy is now adapted here for a good bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1183.0s	1183.0	 And I'm letting Inertia and Biscuits have a little bit more time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1193.0s	1193.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1194.0s	1194.0	 It looks like she's playing with a gerbil. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1196.0s	1196.0	 I want to make sure that Inertia stays pretty low key and mellow enough anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1201.0s	1201.0	 And look, Biscuits looks like she's opening up a little bit more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1203.0s	1203.0	 And I want to point out she's free to retreat under that furniture anytime she wants to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1208.0s	1208.0	 It seems like Biscuits is feeling braver and Inertia is trying to initiate play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1212.0s	1212.0	 But it seems as though Biscuits may have found some kind of loophole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1217.0s	1217.0	 She's racing between all of our living room furniture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1220.0s	1220.0	 It's so fun to see the games that dogs come up with to play with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1224.0s	1224.0	 This relationship definitely looks like it's trending towards being amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1233.0s	1233.0	 Did you hear that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1234.0s	1234.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1235.0s	1235.0	 So the little growling there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1237.0s	1237.0	 Did you hear that growl?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1238.0s	1238.0	 It was potentially resource guarding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1240.0s	1240.0	 Resource guarding is where a dog protects something that they value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1243.0s	1243.0	 It could be food. It could be a bone. It could be a stick, a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1247.0s	1247.0	 You name it. Anything a dog values at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1249.0s	1249.0	 It's extremely natural, particularly for puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1252.0s	1252.0	 I mean, look at the competitive environment that puppies come up in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1255.0s	1255.0	 And particularly Biscuits, being the smallest dog in that group, had to really assert herself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1261.0s	1261.0	 But there's a way to show dogs that they really don't need to feel so defensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1265.0s	1265.0	 And so I'll be focused on resolving this resource guarding as we move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1268.0s	1268.0	 I'm going to put this up for now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1269.0s	1269.0	 Good job, Inertia. You handled that very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1271.0s	1271.0	 So how are you feeling so far with this experience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1274.0s	1274.0	 We're pretty early in it. We've already had a little bit of resource guarding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1277.0s	1277.0	 She's a little hesitant of the crate, but I think she's going to be okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1280.0s	1280.0	 We'll see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1281.0s	1281.0	 I just want to talk about that potty accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1283.0s	1283.0	 I mean, I was hoping not to have it on literally the first day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1287.0s	1287.0	 I understand the rep has reviewed the footage from the security camera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1292.0s	1292.0	 Yeah, here's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1293.0s	1293.0	 I just feel like the inner puppy parent inside of me just gave me the biggest facepalm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1299.0s	1299.0	 because she woke up from a nap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1302.0s	1302.0	 Why do you take a puppy out? Because they just woke up from a nap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1305.0s	1305.0	 It's in my book and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1306.0s	1306.0	 I know. Then she walked over and drank a bunch of water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1310.0s	1310.0	 Why do you take a puppy out? Because they drank a bunch of water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1313.0s	1313.0	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1314.0s	1314.0	 And then she came to you and then me or me then you maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1319.0s	1319.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1320.0s	1320.0	 And then she peed right after that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1323.0s	1323.0	 And look, I'm not saying that she tried really hard to let us know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1327.0s	1327.0	 but I think there were some signs that we could have picked up on that we missed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1331.0s	1331.0	 And I just feel like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1334.0s	1334.0	 I also am very apprehensive about tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1336.0s	1336.0	 This windstorm, the crate thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1339.0s	1339.0	 I feel like you're not going to get much sleep and I'm excited that I get to ignore that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1342.0s	1342.0	 I think we should have you stay up with the dog in one of these episodes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1346.0s	1346.0	 Hey, Zach. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1347.0s	1347.0	 There's some destruction going on over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1350.0s	1350.0	 What? The carpet? Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1352.0s	1352.0	 Here. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1353.0s	1353.0	 And I mean, that's another form of management, obviously supervision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1357.0s	1357.0	 Hey, good. Oh, goodness, goodness. Hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1362.0s	1362.0	 OK, go play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1363.0s	1363.0	 So it still remains a mystery as to if I'm going to be able to get any sleep or how tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1371.0s	1371.0	 She doesn't look very tired yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1373.0s	1373.0	 One of the things that can be problematic when you bring a dog home the first night, you haven't trained them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1378.0s	1378.0	 They don't know anything yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1380.0s	1380.0	 I kind of break it down into two categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1382.0s	1382.0	 There's management and then there's like hands on training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1385.0s	1385.0	 If you're teaching a dog to sit or come, but we have to manage them when we can't tend to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1389.0s	1389.0	 because nobody can send to their dog 24 hours a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1392.0s	1392.0	 Management is just as important in many ways as training itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1399.0s	1399.0	 Oh, my goodness. All right. I can't focus. She's biting on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1402.0s	1402.0	 Let me see those teeth. Look at those teeth, those puppy teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1406.0s	1406.0	 Of course, one way we can get immediate traction on the biting because she doesn't understand the concept of being redirected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1411.0s	1411.0	 She doesn't understand. Look at me. She doesn't know how to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1414.0s	1414.0	 Those are all things that I would typically try to get her to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1417.0s	1417.0	 Another thing that I could do is actually satisfy her desire to bite as long as it's on something acceptable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1423.0s	1423.0	 What do we got here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1425.0s	1425.0	 I just gave her a chew here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1428.0s	1428.0	 I'm hanging out with her, seeing if she gets comfortable chewing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1431.0s	1431.0	 So she's doing a lot better in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1433.0s	1433.0	 My hope is that this will condition her to like being in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1438.0s	1438.0	 I'm going to be sleeping right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1442.0s	1442.0	 You're going to sleep downstairs again so you can get a good night's sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1445.0s	1445.0	 OK, this is by far the most stressful part for me because the last thing that I want or that biscuits wants is to be crying and stressed out all night long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1455.0s	1455.0	 But what I don't know yet is how long this is going to last or how significant this anxiety really is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1460.0s	1460.0	 She's a little anxious. I have a timer set right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1463.0s	1463.0	 I'm going to see if she if the anxiety subsides the first night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1468.0s	1468.0	 It's to be expected, but we've just let her out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1471.0s	1471.0	 She's had exercise, so I'm going to try for a few minutes at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1475.0s	1475.0	 If she doesn't settle down, then what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1479.0s	1479.0	 OK, all right, all right, all right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1482.0s	1482.0	 She's feeling anxious here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1484.0s	1484.0	 That's understandable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1486.0s	1486.0	 All right, we're going to chill for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1489.0s	1489.0	 I'm going to try and put her at ease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1491.0s	1491.0	 I mean, I'm trying to see things from her perspective, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1495.0s	1495.0	 As best as you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1497.0s	1497.0	 Hey, sweet girl. Hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1500.0s	1500.0	 How are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1502.0s	1502.0	 She's had a lot changed in the last several hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1505.0s	1505.0	 She was just around dogs and all she's really ever known.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1509.0s	1509.0	 Here she is with these people she doesn't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1511.0s	1511.0	 You're not going to have free rein all over the bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1514.0s	1514.0	 Not happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1515.0s	1515.0	 I think I'm going to try to get her quiet, get her sleeping here, and then maybe place her in the crate later on when she falls asleep and relaxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1523.0s	1523.0	 I don't know what the rules are going to be at her new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1527.0s	1527.0	 Wherever she ends up, so I want to make sure she's comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1530.0s	1530.0	 But at the same time, I might be asking her to do too much right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1535.0s	1535.0	 I think we might have to adopt a different strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1539.0s	1539.0	 I mean, really, what is the harm?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1541.0s	1541.0	 Can she can just sleep here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1543.0s	1543.0	 OK, problem fixed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1550.0s	1550.0	 See, you hear that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1553.0s	1553.0	 These village dogs are amazing because they come from a part of Alaska that is so remote that you can't even get there with a car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1562.0s	1562.0	 So you actually have to fly in and they end up down here in Anchorage for adoption.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1567.0s	1567.0	 And that's what she is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1568.0s	1568.0	 She's from a remote Alaskan village.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1571.0s	1571.0	 It's going to be interesting to find out what she's made of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1574.0s	1574.0	 What do you guys think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1576.0s	1576.0	 I'm guessing maybe a little Chihuahua for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1579.0s	1579.0	 Not for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1580.0s	1580.0	 It's very much a faux pas to try to guess what a dog is by looking at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1586.0s	1586.0	 As we saw with Chop, what was that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1589.0s	1589.0	 He turned out to be a lab mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1592.0s	1592.0	 I could not believe that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1594.0s	1594.0	 I'll bet you there's definitely going to be a surprise in her DNA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1597.0s	1597.0	 There always is with these guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1599.0s	1599.0	 I mean, I'm tempted to just pass out right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1603.0s	1603.0	 I'm just going to I have to try as a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1605.0s	1605.0	 OK, I've got to give it a test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1607.0s	1607.0	 I can't just assume that this is where she should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1611.0s	1611.0	 So here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1613.0s	1613.0	 And sit up, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1623.0s	1623.0	 OK, that is how we address her underlying emotional issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1630.0s	1630.0	 We didn't have to scold her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1631.0s	1631.0	 We didn't have to yell at her, which is really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1633.0s	1633.0	 No discipline necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1635.0s	1635.0	 We just needed to address her emotional state, got her a little calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1640.0s	1640.0	 And for now, she's relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1643.0s	1643.0	 What do you think? Pretty good. Night one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1645.0s	1645.0	 I mean, it's tough on night one. That's pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1652.0s	1652.0	 She woke up. She's chewing on her chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1655.0s	1655.0	 So I have some of her chews in there because she doesn't seem to bother by me talking right now, which is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1662.0s	1662.0	 But this is why I have like two or three different safe chews inside her crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1667.0s	1667.0	 So she has options if she does wake up and doesn't immediately want for something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1671.0s	1671.0	 And that's also something she enjoys doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1673.0s	1673.0	 So we're hopefully getting a positive correlation with being in the crate by doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1678.0s	1678.0	 It's really kind of magical to watch when it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1682.0s	1682.0	 I suppose the challenge sometimes is we don't know necessarily what to do to address the underlying issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1689.0s	1689.0	 I mean, you know, sometimes it's as easy as the dog is hungry or they have to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1694.0s	1694.0	 Other times, there's something that's making them more anxious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1697.0s	1697.0	 In this case, she's in a brand new place, I think is probably the simplest explanation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1702.0s	1702.0	 There's been a lot of variables, so we can just sum that up by saying change of environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1707.0s	1707.0	 So we'll see if she starts to whine or if she settles back down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1711.0s	1711.0	 She just settled down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1713.0s	1713.0	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1718.0s	1718.0	 I was unconscious six seconds ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1723.0s	1723.0	 Well, I was out. OK, what's happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1728.0s	1728.0	 They make a great soldier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1733.0s	1733.0	 Biscuits is awake again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1735.0s	1735.0	 And this time it seems like she actually needs something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1740.0s	1740.0	 All right, let's go see if she wants to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1749.0s	1749.0	 So this is Biscuits and me in the middle of the night in pitch dark Alaska in a freezing cold windstorm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1757.0s	1757.0	 trying to set a new world record for the fastest potty break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1762.0s	1762.0	 Mission accomplished.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1764.0s	1764.0	 I didn't want to put her just straight back in the crate and have her cry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1768.0s	1768.0	 You can't sleep up here, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1773.0s	1773.0	 She made it like five hours or four hours in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1778.0s	1778.0	 But then we were too tired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1784.0s	1784.0	 The learning curve when raising every individual puppy is different and it's significant even for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1790.0s	1790.0	 To my knowledge, Biscuits has never been in a proper city.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1794.0s	1794.0	 And fortunately, Alaska does have one of those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1797.0s	1797.0	 I mean, just one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1799.0s	1799.0	 But that's all we need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1800.0s	1800.0	 She's going to see a city for the first time and it's going to become very apparent how much she has to learn over the next several weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1808.0s	1808.0	 I mean, we haven't even begun to get traction on potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1811.0s	1811.0	 We've got to deal with things like puppy biting, leash walking, sit down, stay, come, leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1817.0s	1817.0	 Look at me and all in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1820.0s	1820.0	 I got to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cqHBO0OeI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=166&pp=iAQB&t=1823.0s	1823.0	 You're not going to want to miss a single episode of this series, especially if you have a puppy.
