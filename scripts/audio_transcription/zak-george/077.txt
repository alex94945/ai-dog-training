https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 and it may have more to do with that than it does

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 And with that, it's a given that at least some percentage

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 Let's start with the 1600s and Rene Descartes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=137.8s	137.8	 He was a famous philosopher, scientist, and mathematician.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=153.7s	153.7	 Descartes famously thought that animals were simply

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 But by the mid 1700s, new ideas concerning dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=169.3s	169.3	 were starting to emerge.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 but because they're sentient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=181.5s	181.5	 Sentient just means they're able to feel feelings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=183.9s	183.9	 And just a few decades later, 1780s,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 that's where we're at now,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=205.9s	205.9	 I think virtually every single one of us watching

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=209.9s	209.9	 But in his time, there were a lot of people

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=214.4s	214.4	 So now we're only 200 years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=215.9s	215.9	 and we start to see the rise

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=500.3s	500.3	 was that no animals were intentionally hurt

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=526.9s	526.9	 So next, between 1965 and 1979,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=531.9s	531.9	 something really significant happened.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=546.1s	546.1	 There are simple checklist of needs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=547.7s	547.7	 to make sure that an animal has a high quality of life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=550.5s	550.5	 What are these five magical fundamental aspects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=553.6s	553.6	 of animal welfare?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=554.7s	554.7	 Tell me if you agree with all of these by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=556.6s	556.6	 Number one, freedom from hunger and thirst.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=559.3s	559.3	 I think that one speaks for itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=560.9s	560.9	 Number two, freedom from discomfort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=562.9s	562.9	 by providing an appropriate environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=564.5s	564.5	 including shelter and a comfortable resting area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=568.3s	568.3	 So that's like no chained up dogs outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=570.2s	570.2	 Number three, freedom from pain, injury or disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=573.7s	573.7	 Number four, freedom to express most normal behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=577.6s	577.6	 And number five, freedom from fear and distress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=580.3s	580.3	 by ensuring conditions and treatment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=582.5s	582.5	 which avoid mental suffering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=584.6s	584.6	 I think it should be a given that dog trainers are bound
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=587.7s	587.7	 by this very common sense criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=589.6s	589.6	 We are obligated to make sure these fundamental needs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=591.9s	591.9	 are met when we have dogs in our custody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=593.7s	593.7	 So let's look at how we can use these five guidelines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=596.2s	596.2	 in terms of training our own dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=597.9s	597.9	 I'd like to zoom in on number three, four and five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=600.7s	600.7	 So let's look at number three,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=601.7s	601.7	 freedom from pain, injury or disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=603.7s	603.7	 We can make a reasonable case that at the very least
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=607.2s	607.2	 choke, prong and electric collars are walking right up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=610.1s	610.1	 to that line of causing pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=612.5s	612.5	 Remember they appear to work because they cause discomfort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=616.2s	616.2	 and that's when used as directed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=618.4s	618.4	 Basically what I'm saying is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=619.8s	619.8	 even if it is only discomfort and it isn't painful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=623.5s	623.5	 it's unnecessarily approaching pain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=626.8s	626.8	 and we should be going the other direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=628.6s	628.6	 And while I know that proponents of using these tools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=632.3s	632.3	 will say the ends justify the means,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=633.5s	633.5	 this is still highly problematic given what we know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=636.1s	636.1	 and the alternatives available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=638.1s	638.1	 Number four, the freedom to express normal behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=641.3s	641.3	 Let's talk about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=642.4s	642.4	 This is really about a dog's right to be a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=645.4s	645.4	 But when we use punishment to completely suppress behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=648.3s	648.3	 that come naturally to dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=649.9s	649.9	 things like barking, jumping, chewing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=651.7s	651.7	 having tons of extra energy to burn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=654.1s	654.1	 we're potentially harming our dog's quality of life,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=656.5s	656.5	 unnecessarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=657.7s	657.7	 That doesn't mean we let them do what they want,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=659.6s	659.6	 but it's important to let dogs be able to practice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=662.1s	662.1	 those behaviors in ways that we find acceptable too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=665.2s	665.2	 And in all honesty, we see this very often
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=667.7s	667.7	 in the dog training industry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=669.1s	669.1	 the use of these punishing tools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=670.8s	670.8	 in order to suppress behaviors like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=673.1s	673.1	 And number five, freedom from fear and distress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=675.9s	675.9	 I think this is one of the more obvious ones
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=678.1s	678.1	 because we know that aversive methods with all animals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=681.7s	681.7	 including dogs, including people and every other animal

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=686.6s	686.6	 to stress and fear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=687.7s	687.7	 At the very least, aversive training methods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=690.3s	690.3	 come very close to crossing the line of three of these five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhmXmlP_7cs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=695.3s	695.3	 And objectively, sometimes they definitely do.
