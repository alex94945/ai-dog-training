https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I think it's really interesting for me as a dog trainer to work with so many dogs and see that every dog is unique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 As long as you take the time to connect with them, it's not about the breed. It's about you as the trainer and your relationship with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 Savi still gets a little distracted, but she's only eight months old. Watch how patient he is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 We're going to watch from a distance every year because when I get into her area she's like, oh I want to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 But see how Arden, he's a big guy, but he's down there eye to eye with her. You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 Lots of love, lots of genuine interaction right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 I think they need to practice. Leave it a little bit though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 They'll get there in a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 Abby gets a little reluctant of strangers. Normally she's very guarded when I come up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 So we've made progress on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 That's why socialization is so important for a dog, especially when they're under eight months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 I think Abby's only five months old. Six months? Six months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 If your dog is responsive to play, use it. I mean a ball can be like a hundred dollar bill to some dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 Let me see, leave it over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 So I'm looking for, watch me and leave it. We'll do both here at the same time so I can look at this as I come around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 Oh excellent job Sadie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 Very good. Can you make it a little bit harder for her? Put that right in front of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 Look at that. That's what I'm talking about. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 Eight months old guys. I mean it's all about communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 You don't need to pull your dog away to teach them that. You connect with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 We talk about the training bubble a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 See that? Look at that line right there. Boom. That's a laser beam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 That's what I like to see. Woo wee yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 It's like an ounce of turkey in front of Bixby. Look at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 And I mean, talk about a connection. These guys have such a strong connection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 I love watching them work together. That looks awesome. It's very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 And huge training bubble between her and Pearl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 In other words, she's able to get really good communication from way up here and her dog's way down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 I like to see a solid 10 second sit-stay with duration and distance at this point in the class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 I like to see if they're able to do that in this distracting environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 Look at this. Eight months old. On the first day she was all over the place and they were like, what do I do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 When your dog looks at the distraction but then looks back at you, that's your cue that they're paying attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 Woo. She's thinking and there's that look. Beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 Chihuahuas have a stereotype for being very difficult to train but I can't, I mean she's absolutely immune to that stereotype.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 And that's why we shouldn't stereotype so much. I'm really big on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 Because it's all about the relationship. Look at that. Did you see the look?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Yes, right there. That's good. That's it. And that's the moment you wait for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 See the body language here? Very clear. There's no breakdown in communication here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 Wait for the look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 Boom. Right there. I mean, you know, that's what we built on. Again, only six months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 Six months old here. Already like showing major progress on stay with distractions. Beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 Bixby is a Boston Terrier Italian Greyhound mix. How about that for a combination?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 Bixby, come here. Bixby. Bixby. Bixby. Bixby. Bixby. Bixby. Bixby. Bixby. I've got better turkey. Come here. Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 Good girl. Stop talking about, man. I mean, that's tough. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 Like I say, traditionally, these are things that you wouldn't even approach until you get to the advanced level in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 Bixby. And see right there. You see her timing? And that's what you do when your dog jumps. See, look, she's boom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 Oh, you got such a weird mouth. Yes, play dead. Good. Good job. Stay. And right here, training bubble nice and tight. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 Look at this. I'm pushing it, trying to get a rollover, but that's okay. But you see where I would go here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 Almost. Oh, rollover. She did it. I get so excited when this happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 The reason I like trick training so much is because it puts people and the dog in such a...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 What's the right word for this? In such a positive frame of mind that your training launches itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 More important than the trick is the communication you build during the trick training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=246.0s	246.0	 Look at this. Roll over. That quick. That quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 Ah, yes. She is. That's wonderful. Look at this. Look at this. Look. What? What? What? Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 I'm sorry. I got excited there. And rather than almost, it's yes, you're on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 So just shift that emphasis a little bit. But that's awesome. That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=269.0s	269.0	 We're working on SimPretty over here with Bixby. Come on. Yes. Good. I mean right there. That's all there is to it with some dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 Every dog requires that unique tailored approach. Let me know what you think of the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=280.0s	280.0	 I'm really curious to see how you're liking this format, how you're liking the different dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 It excites me because it allows me to show you so many different situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHKEPW6Xr18&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=640&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 What people are doing right, what they're doing wrong. Leave a comment below. Click the thumbs up.
