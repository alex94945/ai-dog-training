https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 In today's video, I'm going to show you how to make your dog a mathematical genius.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=4.4s	4.4	 Three times two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 Well, kind of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=10.8s	10.8	 Now, in my last video, I showed you how to teach your dog to speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=13.8s	13.8	 The thing that I like most about this trick is that it's a wonderful exercise in subtlety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=19.5s	19.5	 Our dogs are so responsive to even the most minor movements that we make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=23.5s	23.5	 That's one of the things that makes them very special,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=25.7s	25.7	 and that's how they learn to communicate with us by evaluating what we're doing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=29.5s	29.5	 both what we're saying and in our body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 Now, like with any trick, you should cater it to your individual dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=35.7s	35.7	 I'm going to show you one way that I do it, but there are several ways that you could do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=39.1s	39.1	 In order to be really successful at this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=41.1s	41.1	 your dog should already know how to bark on a hand signal like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 Speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=45.6s	45.6	 So in a nutshell, we want to teach our dogs how to start barking and how to stop barking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=50.2s	50.2	 on a hand signal, and then over time, we want to make that hand signal more and more subtle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 So it might look something like this, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 Speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=62.7s	62.7	 Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=63.6s	63.6	 This means speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 This means stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 Then you want it to look something more like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=68.3s	68.3	 Again, I'm going for three barks here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=74.6s	74.6	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 I'm going to reward it there with recurrency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=76.9s	76.9	 And then you want to reduce your hand signal to even a more subtle one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=81.1s	81.1	 maybe something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=85.8s	85.8	 You might have one of two problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 Either A, your dog doesn't bark very willingly yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=90.1s	90.1	 You'll need to work on that before you can get too advanced here with the math.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 Or B, they bark constantly, which means you have to improve your communication with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=98.3s	98.3	 to get them to stop barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=99.8s	99.8	 And a way to have fun with this is to do it with flashcards, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=102.5s	102.5	 This is something I used to do a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 Okay, Bri, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 Pick one, anyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=105.9s	105.9	 How about this one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=107.6s	107.6	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 I think we can do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=108.9s	108.9	 So again, we're going to count the number of times that Venus barks here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 and make sure you're nice and wide so they can see how this is done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 Let's put this there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 So read me the math problem, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 It is six times two minus eight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=124.5s	124.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 Pretty good, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=132.1s	132.1	 Or it can be as simple as this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 I'm going to have her bark four times, but watch how I cue her to stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 Breaking eye contact is a great way to do it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=144.1s	144.1	 That's if you have solid communication with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=146.7s	146.7	 You must have a training mindset that is rooted in your relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 and your communication with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 You can't teach a trick like this with traditional training methods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 This has very little to do with the trick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 and very much to do with building exceptional communication with our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=162.2s	162.2	 So I thought I'd do something a little special this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=164.2s	164.2	 I'm actually going to do two different contests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=166.3s	166.3	 I'm going to give away both of these frisbees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 I will send them to you anywhere in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 Basically, all you have to do is leave a comment below,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 and I'll randomly select someone and send you one of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=175.9s	175.9	 The way to get the other frisbee is to go like me on Facebook,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=179.2s	179.2	 and I'm going to randomly select someone and send you a frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=182.2s	182.2	 Again, anywhere in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=183.4s	183.4	 Doesn't matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 The links will be in the description, and I hope you guys enjoyed the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=187.1s	187.1	 Good job, Venus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmdB03zGqQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=646&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 Go.
