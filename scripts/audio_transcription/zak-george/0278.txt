https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=124.8s	124.8	 that we've prepared. I'm just gonna put it there. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 generally, what I when she does that I've been saying inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 leave it alone. And she's been really good. Well, unless the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=135.7s	135.7	 camera's running. Hey, look at me. Leave it. Good girl. Alright,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 so I'm going to do an experiment. I'm going to walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=143.3s	143.3	 out. We're going to see how she does. I've got a camera set up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=146.1s	146.1	 over here. Now my honest impression is that this is like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=149.1s	149.1	 5050. But I'm really curious to get this baseline. So we'll see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 how she does. Okay, I'm just gonna leave. I guess Bri should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 come with me. So we can make this a true test. And we'll just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 head on out here to the deck. I have faith in her. I can't even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 believe I said it was 5050. She's not even trying to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 that food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 So I'm just gonna peek at her right there. That's cool. She
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 walked around the table. She's aware that it's there. Then she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=178.6s	178.6	 sees we're out here and she's just coming so far she hasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 touched it. So I think our training has done pretty well so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 far. This is good. It's one thing for her to do this well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=188.1s	188.1	 after a few seconds. But let's see if we keep it out there for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=190.4s	190.4	 little while if she will actually generalize not stealing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 off of a plate. Oh, she inertia leave that alone. Oh boy. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 okay. All right, I got too cocky. Leave that alone. Very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=205.7s	205.7	 good. So all right, that tells me I still need to spell it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 a little bit more for her. See this? Leave it alone. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 Practice again, I'm going to give her a few minutes. She's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 just looking at me. She's like, why do you keep putting me in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 the room with this? I think it's occurred to her that this might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=221.8s	221.8	 be a test. So overall, I mean, what would you give her? I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=225.8s	225.8	 give her maybe a B minus. I mean, she licked it, but she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 didn't technically eat it. But I'd like to have more confidence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=232.2s	232.2	 in that moving forward. So again, we're going to continue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=234.4s	234.4	 working on it. She's still not perfect. Set up real world tests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=237.4s	237.4	 like this with your dog often so that you can really clearly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 communicate to them exactly how you want them to behave. Oh, boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 She didn't lick the watermelon, did she? I hope not.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=256.4s	256.4	 when I ask her, it's obviously time to teach her how to count.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=260.4s	260.4	 Right? Basically, my goal is to teach her how to bark multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=263.6s	263.6	 times in a row and stop on cue. inertia does really well with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=267.2s	267.2	 speak inside. So we're at the point of training it outside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=270.1s	270.1	 but still at my house in order to really teach her how to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=273.4s	273.4	 this everywhere. Remember, when you change your dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 environment, even if it's just out on the back deck, they may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=278.5s	278.5	 be more likely to act on characteristically. So let me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=280.8s	280.8	 see up first how she's doing on speak outside. Get up and speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 Good. Yes, I'm going to reward it. She didn't make a sound, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=290.5s	290.5	 she's trying and that's really all that matters. Speak. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=295.3s	295.3	 there you go. Okay, nice. So she's getting she's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=298.9s	298.9	 Let's see if she does it for just a hand signal. Yeah, good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=308.1s	308.1	 that again. Good. Perfect. Let's see if she'll do it when I say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 speak without a hand signal. Speak. Good. Nice. Let me just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=319.2s	319.2	 prove this a little bit. Let me do it like this. Speak. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=324.8s	324.8	 Maybe turn my back to her. Speak. Yes. She's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=332.9s	332.9	 That was good. I didn't know she was doing quite that well. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=335.7s	335.7	 now let me see if I can get her to bark a couple of times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=338.2s	338.2	 Speak. Yes. Good. Do you see how she brainstormed there? She spoke
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 once. And then she was like, Where's my treat? Okay, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=351.0s	351.0	 didn't work. He's still looking at me. Maybe I should try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=353.9s	353.9	 barking again. This time I'm gonna ask her to speak but I'm

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJw2pQaB2wU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=279&pp=iAQB&t=422.9s	422.9	 two. What's two plus two? Yes, very good. So that was good.
