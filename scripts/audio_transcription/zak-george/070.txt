https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I have no reason to believe that this dog has ever even been inside of a house before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=4.1s	4.1	 So I want to make my job as easy as possible by getting them satisfied mentally by checking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 out the environment, taking a nice long walk as well as physically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=12.1s	12.1	 At no point here in this particular stretch is the leash even close to being loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 There are a lot of people who are really tool focused when it comes to training dogs and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 they think that by having a harness like this on a dog that you're encouraging the goodness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=27.4s	27.4	 gracious that you're encouraging the pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=30.7s	30.7	 Come on now back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 I just want to brace when he lunges out like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=34.7s	34.7	 There were some ducks over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=35.9s	35.9	 So so far he's lunged at ducks at least three times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 I use a Y shaped harness like this while I'm teaching dogs not to pull on the leash because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 it avoids putting pressure on their most sensitive areas like their throat and their joints.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=47.4s	47.4	 When you're teaching a dog to walk politely, considering what is actually causing them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=51.4s	51.4	 to pull will help you make progress much faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=53.9s	53.9	 So here George pulled because he wanted to lunge at those ducks, not because he's wearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvoalbYpnGw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=71&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 a harness.
