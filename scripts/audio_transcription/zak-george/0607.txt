https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=35.1s	35.1	 Stay and come when we call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=37.3s	37.3	 Make sure you're subscribed and tell me in the comments below how energetic is your dog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=52.9s	52.9	 Also make sure you give me a thumbs up and tell your friends about me on Facebook too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=56.8s	56.8	 So I've got a capacity class coming in right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=59.5s	59.5	 I get really excited when I get to work with new dogs because every dog is so unique like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 Molly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=65.4s	65.4	 This is Molly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 Molly is one of the most unusual mixes ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 Now if you know dog breeds you'll be able to tell what she is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=71.2s	71.2	 She's actually a pit full Boston Terrier mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=74.9s	74.9	 I don't know how they would make those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 I mean I do know how but it's a really awkward image in my mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 If I get within a couple of miles of Sassy over here she tends to get kind of excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=84.2s	84.2	 Can you tell?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=85.2s	85.2	 My dogs get super excited in class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 Hey what can I say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=88.2s	88.2	 My classes are fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 If your dog is this energetic and this happy the best thing to do is let them adjust to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=94.5s	94.5	 their surroundings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=95.5s	95.5	 You should also be taking them to lots of new places as often as you can so that when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=100.1s	100.1	 they do go to a new place it's not such a special occasion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=103.6s	103.6	 I always encourage beginners to use clicker training with their dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=106.7s	106.7	 The bottom line with clicker training is that you click when your dog does something you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=110.3s	110.3	 like and follow it up with a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 But what do you do if your dog is nervous or scared of the clicker?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=118.3s	118.3	 This is ideal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=119.5s	119.5	 She doesn't like the clicker or he doesn't like the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 If you notice that the clicking sound makes your dog feel uneasy you could try using a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=125.5s	125.5	 quieter clicker or you could use a word like yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 Clicker training isn't really about a word or a tool but it's more about giving your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=132.9s	132.9	 dog that immediate and prompt feedback to let them know that they did something that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=136.9s	136.9	 you like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 Dogs have good positive feeling and emotion behind your rewards as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=142.7s	142.7	 Right now we're working on stay for duration only.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=145.1s	145.1	 Just trying to get a one to three second stay in the initial stages.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 learning how to stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=165.4s	165.4	 Do you know what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=166.7s	166.7	 Practice in various environments often and find small reasons to reward your dog when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=170.7s	170.7	 they are this distracted.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 We're doing both stay with duration and with distance, walking away from them very early
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=181.1s	181.1	 on in the game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 having them stay while you're up close?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspvZR79-x0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=608&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 Yep, and then back here and reward.
