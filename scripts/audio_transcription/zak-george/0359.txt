https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=3.7s	3.7	 No, what is it?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=12.8s	12.8	 at that specific time in their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 And you also get a great training guide in every box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 Whoa!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 She just immediately goes into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Looks like you've got like a tug toy on one of the arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=22.5s	22.5	 There's squeakers everywhere on this toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 And the reason that's so important when you have a toy that's fun to tug with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 that's far more likely to keep your dog interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=31.9s	31.9	 Three month old puppies like Rose are definitely going to be play biters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 and destructive chewers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=35.9s	35.9	 I love that they included a Kong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 And they even include this peanut butter, which is optimized for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=40.7s	40.7	 Rose, that's not the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 This will keep your puppy preoccupied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 Sweet potato chews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=45.1s	45.1	 With a three month old dog, they've got to have a variety of different things to chew on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 So between the Kong and these sweet potato chews and some homemade chews like frozen carrots,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=52.8s	52.8	 this is likely to help you deal with even the most persistent puppy teething.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=56.1s	56.1	 A treat pouch and treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=57.6s	57.6	 These will come in handy later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=58.7s	58.7	 Pup Box has a great deal right now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 You guys have been asking for more follow up videos for dogs I feature on my channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=88.1s	88.1	 So that's exactly what I'm giving you today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 Last time we introduced Rose to her first leash training session outside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 but in a relatively distraction free environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=95.6s	95.6	 Today we're going to take Rose's leash skills to the next level by training in three different environments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=100.6s	100.6	 each with increasing levels of difficulty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=102.8s	102.8	 Let's start in a normal neighborhood setting right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=104.9s	104.9	 Before you do training in public places like this with your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=107.4s	107.4	 make sure that your dog is vaccinated and you have the okay from your vet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=110.4s	110.4	 It's easy to forget your treats when you take your dog on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=112.8s	112.8	 So make sure you have your currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 Because you're going to need to be able to motivate your dog to listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=116.8s	116.8	 Fortunately, I've got my treat pouch and my treats from my three month pup box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 So we're in good shape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 Okay, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=124.9s	124.9	 So she's very curious about people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 I'm going to get her warmed up with an easy sit right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 Since we are in a new environment, the fact that she's sitting for a treat tells me I'm in good shape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 Now that I've confirmed that she'll pay attention to me in this new place,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 I'm ready to start my leash walking session with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=138.4s	138.4	 So we're going to take a couple of steps over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=140.1s	140.1	 There's a little bit of jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 That's kind of a real common issue that a lot of puppies have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=143.8s	143.8	 On one hand, I really love this playful energy and that she's so into me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 But on the other hand, I want her to learn how to walk nicely on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=150.4s	150.4	 Training a puppy, you really have to walk the line between allowing them to have fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 while at the same time showing them the rules that you expect them to listen to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=157.9s	157.9	 When she jumps right now for this lesson, I'm going to make it very clear to withhold and put her into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=162.2s	162.2	 I want to really get the mechanics down before we take a proper walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=165.9s	165.9	 Sit. Yes. Sit. Yes. Sit. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 I'm quickly putting Rose into that sit before she has a chance to jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=174.7s	174.7	 See right there how she crosses in front of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 A lot of dogs do that when they're learning how to walk on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=179.3s	179.3	 So I'm going to work on keeping her on one side of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 I think I'll go with my left side and I'll just encourage her like this, keeping the treat over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 So every time that she crosses in front of me or thinks about it, I'm going to redirect her off to the side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=190.1s	190.1	 And you've got to be pretty relentless in your consistency about redirecting your dog to keep them on one side of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=195.4s	195.4	 Oh, look at that. Look how she's staying on my left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=197.4s	197.4	 And as soon as she starts to run ahead like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 you see how I'm turning to keep her on one side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=201.8s	201.8	 That should go a long way to getting her in the habit of walking on one side of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=205.4s	205.4	 And you might notice the rate at which I'm rewarding here is pretty significant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=208.9s	208.9	 There's a dog over here and there's a person up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 Let me get her attention on me. Sit. Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=214.4s	214.4	 And this was a really good opportunity because see, they're really far away over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 That gives me enough room to really get her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=220.4s	220.4	 That's why practicing in areas like this that are at your dog's current skill level are really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=225.8s	225.8	 And see, those are the real world distractions that you get when you train in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 This is why training inside of your house isn't good enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=232.1s	232.1	 But you want to get your dog really reliable with minor distractions like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=235.7s	235.7	 before you take them to places that are more distracting, like where dogs frequent or where dogs actually are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=241.4s	241.4	 So let's go find some more challenging distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 Look at her checking this place out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=245.3s	245.3	 So this place, there are many dogs and people that walk here regularly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 So there's lots of sense here. You can see she's immediately intrigued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 I'm not just going to jump into a training session right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=254.9s	254.9	 Being in a new place like this with so many different smells and sights,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=258.1s	258.1	 I'm going to give her a second to adjust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=259.7s	259.7	 Rose, come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=261.8s	261.8	 I'm not going to pull her. See how she's resisting me because she's distracted in public right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 Come here. See, she's a little slow to respond, but she's responding nonetheless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=269.8s	269.8	 So I really appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=271.2s	271.2	 Yes. Did you see that? She automatically looked back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 Those are the types of moments you really want to recognize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=276.5s	276.5	 It's important to really get your dog to go through the motions by themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 You hear that loud truck? I didn't know that was coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=284.1s	284.1	 This is the beauty of training in public. Take advantage of those moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 She reacted well. I mean, she acknowledged the truck. That's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=289.8s	289.8	 I know it doesn't look like much, but when you have a dog this young,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=292.7s	292.7	 you take any victory you can get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=294.4s	294.4	 It's normal with a puppy who doesn't know very much yet to constantly correct them and say, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=299.6s	299.6	 But that's so counterproductive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 You have to search for reasons to acknowledge what your dog is doing right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=304.8s	304.8	 That'll be the fastest path to success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=306.8s	306.8	 So rather than saying, no, don't jump on me, no, don't pull on the leash, no, don't pick up that thing on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 Say things like, yes, I like that you looked at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 Yes, I like that you acknowledge that turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=316.2s	316.2	 Yes, I like that you left that piece of garbage alone when I redirected you with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=320.4s	320.4	 In general, yes, it's a good idea to get garbage out of your dog's mouth when they get to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 But I saw an opportunity there to really teach her to think and redirect with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=327.6s	327.6	 So I snapped into training mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 Rose, this way. Much quicker to respond that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=332.2s	332.2	 She's becoming more reliable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=333.7s	333.7	 So I'm kind of rewarding, say, every other time right now instead of every single time like I was before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=338.8s	338.8	 Now she's really looking to me to see where the walk is headed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=341.7s	341.7	 Teaching your dog to walk nicely on a leash is actually a months long process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=345.4s	345.4	 because dogs need to learn how to walk nice contextually in a variety of different places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=350.0s	350.0	 I can't emphasize that enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=351.5s	351.5	 One of the most challenging things you can ask just about any dog to do is to listen to you in the presence of other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=357.3s	357.3	 Let's see how that goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=358.3s	358.3	 So we're here at the dog park right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=360.3s	360.3	 Obviously, her interest is piqued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=362.2s	362.2	 I mean, there's dogs walking in and out of the dog park before I even focus on doing any actual training with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=368.3s	368.3	 I've got to let her take this in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=369.4s	369.4	 I mean, this is wild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=370.4s	370.4	 There's dozens of dogs everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=372.3s	372.3	 And I can't just expect her to tune that out, especially at the age of three months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 Oh, she's discovered the dogs over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=379.8s	379.8	 Hey, it's OK. So right there, she's excited by another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 I'm seeing a lot of activity where she's showing these outbursts towards other dogs right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=386.9s	386.9	 But we're kind of right on the threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=389.2s	389.2	 It's hard for her to focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=390.4s	390.4	 So I think we need to get a little farther away from the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=392.5s	392.5	 The farther you are away from a distraction, the easier it is to get your dog to listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=397.1s	397.1	 I'm thinking that we should have better luck over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=399.4s	399.4	 And even though we've only gone 20 feet back, this is a new environment, a bit easier environment for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=404.4s	404.4	 because she's farther away from the dogs entering the park over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=407.4s	407.4	 And there's fewer dogs over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=409.8s	409.8	 Rose, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=415.5s	415.5	 So right now, even though she's ignoring me, I'm saying, Rose, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=418.9s	418.9	 I'm still going to go ahead and reward her because she's not barking and lunging at the other dogs like she was doing before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=424.3s	424.3	 So again, I'm really searching for those reasons to acknowledge progress over perfection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=429.0s	429.0	 Because she's becoming a little less reliable, I'm going to reward her just a little bit extra right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=434.0s	434.0	 And I'm just changing direction here to really get her focused on me because I can change direction at any time when walking her on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=440.6s	440.6	 So she needs to learn to pay attention to me when I do shift directions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=444.2s	444.2	 Be patient with your dog. Do not insist that they perfect leash walking at this age, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=449.7s	449.7	 Remember, it's a months long process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=452.2s	452.2	 And right now, I feel like I've got her attention pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=454.8s	454.8	 So I'm going to reward, you know, about 50 percent of the time right now for this particular lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=459.5s	459.5	 Balancing that rate of reinforcement is quite tricky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=462.5s	462.5	 By rate of reinforcement, I'm talking about the degree with which you reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=465.7s	465.7	 In other words, the less reliable a dog is, the more often you need to reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=469.6s	469.6	 And the more reliable your dog is, the less often you need to reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=472.6s	472.6	 I think Rose is ready to go back up here. Let's see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=475.2s	475.2	 So any time she voluntarily gives me her attention in the presence of other dogs, I want to be sure to go ahead and let her know I appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=482.1s	482.1	 She's taking treats again. That means that she's receptive to listening to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=486.1s	486.1	 We've got a dog coming. Let's see how she behaves now. Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=490.0s	490.0	 Good work. She can look at the dog. Now let's move. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=494.1s	494.1	 Back here and look at this much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=496.7s	496.7	 And this is why using a good currency is so important when you're working with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=500.4s	500.4	 Because look how compliant she is. Now, you can wean your dog off treats over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=503.7s	503.7	 But at three months old, that's not the time to do it. Rose this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=507.1s	507.1	 She sees the dog. Yes. Magic moment right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=510.8s	510.8	 She looked directly at that dog and then paid attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=513.6s	513.6	 I mean, this is fantastic for an introductory lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=516.5s	516.5	 Get 50 percent off your first pup box when you sign up for a three, six or 12 month subscription by going to pup box dot com slash Zach and entering discount code Zach.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIzv1wOGzo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=360&pp=iAQB&t=527.6s	527.6	 Make sure you're subscribed to my channel if you have a new dog, especially I'll show you everything you need to know to get them trained.
