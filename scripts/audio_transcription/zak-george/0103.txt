https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 She in general seems to be doing well with other dogs, our own included, but cats is kind of a wild card.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=11.7s	11.7	 When are cats not a wild card?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=13.4s	13.4	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=13.9s	13.9	 Angela is very accustomed to coming downstairs to socialize with me in the evenings,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=18.5s	18.5	 and she is not about to let Veronica stand in the way of her evening ritual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 Veronica is a really playful puppy and she clearly wants to chase Angela.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 This is one of the reasons I'm keeping her on leash, one of many reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=33.3s	33.3	 And the great thing about the leash, you're managing her so you're keeping it from escalating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 so at least this desire to chase the cat isn't getting established.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=42.9s	42.9	 They still definitely have a long way to go, but it really seems like over time Veronica is learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=47.9s	47.9	 that she does not usually get to chase Angela when she sees her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=52.2s	52.2	 Hopefully I can keep it that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=54.7s	54.7	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWClB8N1TeU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 That's so good.
