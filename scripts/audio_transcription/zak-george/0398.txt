https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Welcome to another video today we're going to meet Gizmo who is a four or five month old puppy somewhere in that range
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 And he tends to be a little bit nervous of new people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 So i'm curious to see how he's doing with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=9.6s	9.6	 I also understand that he has issues with picking things up on a walk that he's not supposed to so I hope to give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=14.6s	14.6	 Some advice on that and also he doesn't want to leave the cat alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=18.1s	18.1	 So we're going to have a general training session with him see how he does with those things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 I want to urge you guys to have your food automatically shipped to you from pet flow because it's going to make things much

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=33.5s	33.5	 Flow all you have to do is choose your dog's food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 They'll give you ten dollars off your first three orders so that you can see if it's right for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 Tell pet flow how often you want it to be delivered and enter code zac30 at checkout
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 I'm gonna have that link in the description below. How old is gizmo four months. Oh, wow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=48.5s	48.5	 He's a big four months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=49.8s	49.8	 How long have you been with me on youtube when I got the dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=52.1s	52.1	 I started researching the media like I was like, oh this guy's local
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 Came across the video first and then went and bought the book on amazon. Thank you. I appreciate that gizmo. You are so handsome, sir
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 Can I give this to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=64.8s	64.8	 So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 When he meets strangers typically does he is he just like kind of reserved or does he kind of like really freak out or is he nip?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=72.1s	72.1	 He's reserved and he'll he does do the submissive urination. Oh, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=76.1s	76.1	 Good to know and that's that's getting a little bit better. This is really good though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 That's one of the reasons like socializing a dog, especially when they're under eight months like gizmo is is so important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 This is kind of a impromptu counter conditioning exercise. In other words, i'm trying to change his emotional response to strangers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=93.4s	93.4	 I'm just trying to take advantage of that time to say hey look you've never met me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=96.6s	96.6	 I'm giving you tiny pieces of turkey here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=99.4s	99.4	 And he's already lighting up and the tail his body language here is suggesting that he's way more at ease
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 How much training have you done with him? I'm like i've been trying to do them almost every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 I try to spend a little time with him play with him and then you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 Work with him a little bit. Oh, that's good. He went right into the down. Yeah, he's got that down pretty well, actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 I see that look at these. He's so lanky. He's having a hard time with steak. Oh, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=120.7s	120.7	 You know and leave it. Uh, you forget it if it's the cat I have to go grab him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=124.9s	124.9	 Oh, okay. Gotcha him and the kitten are uh, they're they play but he just doesn't realize that he's so much bigger than the cat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=130.8s	130.8	 Are you pretty good about keeping him on leash? I go through my spurts. I'll keep him on the leash for a while and then off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 Okay, I'll let him go and then that's when he starts acting a fool. I'll go put the leash back on him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=140.5s	140.5	 I like that. He's sitting politely right now when you catch your dog doing something that you just like and you're not even asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=146.1s	146.1	 Asking for it. Just go ahead and reward it. Just hey, I like that. You're being good right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=151.3s	151.3	 Oh good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=153.4s	153.4	 I just pointed at my eyes and he looked directly into my eyes. Have you been working purposefully and look at me? Yes. Oh good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=161.9s	161.9	 Oh, did you see that that's a sharp leave it look at me combo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 I like the leave it look at me combo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=167.2s	167.2	 That's a sign that you've really been working on a lot of good impulse control training and you mentioned you're having problems with him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 Chasing the family cat cat will get on the couch wait for him to walk by and then jump on him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=175.3s	175.3	 Oh, okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=175.9s	175.9	 Well, that's kind of hilarious. Is it pretty easy to kind of set up the cat to kind of be in the area while you work on stay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=181.1s	181.1	 Yeah, the cat's all over the house pretty much, you know runs free if you focus on teaching gizmo to stay with toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=188.1s	188.1	 This is related to teaching your dog to behave around the cat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 They have to be able to stay with something like this in front of them before you can expect them to stay with a cat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=195.5s	195.5	 So i'm just trying to verify that he's tempted by this to see if it's a valid distraction and it looks like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=201.1s	201.1	 You know, he's interested in going after the toy a little bit there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=205.9s	205.9	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=208.3s	208.3	 Stay yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=212.1s	212.1	 Stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=216.5s	216.5	 Stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=219.3s	219.3	 Up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 Yes, good stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 Stay and see right now you see the pace in which i'm training. It's fast right now stay because i've got momentum up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=234.3s	234.3	 Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 So i'm just trying to burn it into his brain every time you're tempted by something and I ask you to look at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 Please look at me. And if you do that, i'm going to reinforce that with something you love
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=243.1s	243.1	 Here stay and it's like a lot of repetition stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=247.3s	247.3	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=249.7s	249.7	 Look at that look at you can see him fighting it up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=252.2s	252.2	 I don't want to push him to failure because I was right on the edge there stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=259.8s	259.8	 Yes, very good stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=262.6s	262.6	 And remember things with motion up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 Good, very good. Okay. Good job. That was a nice little nice little stay session right there, but things with motion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 Are going to be much more tempting. So you're working towards stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=277.1s	277.1	 Up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=278.6s	278.6	 Yes, good almost lost him, but it didn't so that's cool without introducing him to another toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=283.7s	283.7	 Let's ask him to stay this is a surprise primary training session. We're simulating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=288.4s	288.4	 Teaching him how to listen while in a surprise state of mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=290.9s	290.9	 You see it's a little tougher because that's a new toy and right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 I even had to put the treat right at his nose to say hey pay attention to me over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=297.9s	297.9	 Because that's real hard if you don't have your dog's eyes. It's really hard to communicate with them stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 Up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=305.7s	305.7	 Nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=306.7s	306.7	 Good and so that's a step closer to getting them to listen around the cat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=310.5s	310.5	 But we just have to avoid taking steps that are too big, you know where it's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 Hey, you stay for the ball now. You should stay for everything you have to kind of work up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=318.9s	318.9	 To that and work up to surprising them to where they're not expecting to stay where you just randomly do these pop quizzes on them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=325.5s	325.5	 You know outside of normal training sessions if I call him if he's in the other room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=329.3s	329.3	 I'll have to go up and get him. Come on. He's got to visually see me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=332.5s	332.5	 Has it gotten less reliable over the last several weeks or is it that's typically what I would expect because he's growing becoming more athletic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 And capable so they're like, yeah, you know, I can probably get away with not listening dogs are just a product of their experiences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=344.6s	344.6	 So when they get enough instances of the rule not being enforced they realize it's optional gizmo come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=352.2s	352.2	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=354.7s	354.7	 Looks like he's doing pretty well in coming called to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=356.9s	356.9	 But what I would recommend on come when called number one taking a step back on your training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=360.7s	360.7	 You'll know in the book that's a tenet of my right of my training program is to always be prepared to take a step back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=365.9s	365.9	 Even if you don't tie him to you just having him running around, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=369.9s	369.9	 With a loose leash can be good assuming you've kind of puppy proof the house where it's not likely to snag on anything and knock it down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=375.4s	375.4	 But he'll be a lot easier to get to so when he doesn't come to you you pick up the leash and just kind of escort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=379.7s	379.7	 Him back to where you were calling him from even if you got to bring a treat with you swallow the pride get the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=384.3s	384.3	 Really get him to go through the motions voluntarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 Rather than picking him up say or anything like that because that'll like teach him how to behave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=391.7s	391.7	 A common question here is if your dog isn't coming to you and you go and you lure them and you say come on like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=396.5s	396.5	 Are you reinforcing them not coming to you because you went and offered them a treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=400.7s	400.7	 And no not at all if those legs are coming to you. That's the action you're rewarding. Hi you are come here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=407.2s	407.2	 sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 Look at that. Oh now he's looking come on. Let's go. He's pepping up. I like that tail wagon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=414.0s	414.0	 Good come on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 This way come come on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=418.2s	418.2	 Check this out sit stay. Yes. Okay. Come on didn't reward that time because right now we're kind of in this groove
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=425.0s	425.0	 So i'm trying to phase in intermittent rewarding because that really is the most effective way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=429.9s	429.9	 I mean when you're first introducing something new to your dog you treat treat treat like crazy, but as they're becoming more reliable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=436.3s	436.3	 Treating them more randomly is good. Didn't even ask him to come there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=441.7s	441.7	 Reward that because I like that. I think he's part billy goat when they say he's mixed the vet asked me what I said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=446.5s	446.5	 I think it's billy goat because anything he gets he'll put that down. Let me have that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=451.8s	451.8	 Anything he can get that's one of those natural behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=454.2s	454.2	 We have to curb and and show them how we'd prefer they behave that's so natural
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=459.2s	459.2	 For for dogs because they don't have hands and and they're brand new to the world. So like what's this? What's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=463.8s	463.8	 What's this? You know, and they're just like grabbing everything they can remember there's two aspects to training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=468.6s	468.6	 A dog first you have to manage them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=470.6s	470.6	 So in other words by having him on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=472.2s	472.2	 He's a lot less likely to go and pick things up though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=474.6s	474.6	 He can still pick things up within range, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=476.8s	476.8	 But the better you control the environment the less likely that is so you can diminish the number of instances
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=482.1s	482.1	 That he gets by with picking things up. He's not supposed to so that's management
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=486.1s	486.1	 That doesn't teach him though. And that's the thing you just have to teach. I mean literally dozens hundreds of items
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=492.5s	492.5	 Just practicing your leave it drill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=494.7s	494.7	 Because so often we get content with practicing leave it with a treat like they show you in puppy class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=499.4s	499.4	 But there's so much more to teaching a dog how to leave things alone than that one specific instance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=504.6s	504.6	 The mistake that most will make on this type of training is relying exclusively on waiting for the specific situation to emerge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=512.9s	512.9	 To then try to teach the dog without first preparing them leave it alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=519.0s	519.0	 Over here, please sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=521.9s	521.9	 Good and see right the reason we're doing it while we're in this mindset is because i'm 100 focused on him. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=528.4s	528.4	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=529.4s	529.4	 And it's not like on a walk where i'm trying to get across the street and you know dogs realize when you're distracted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=536.3s	536.3	 So i'm being very purposeful stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=540.5s	540.5	 Yes, okay good work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=543.1s	543.1	 I'm kind of mixing stay and leave it here because for all intents and purposes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=546.9s	546.9	 This drill is just basically saying pay attention to me. Don't pay attention to that. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=551.2s	551.2	 It's kind of semantics at this point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=554.0s	554.0	 Come with your own distractions on a training walk where you're like, okay, this isn't a real walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=558.1s	558.1	 He thinks it's our normal walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=559.7s	559.7	 But actually I as the trainer i'm going to be focused on being able to drop treats in front of him and get him to look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=564.9s	564.9	 At me leave it alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=567.1s	567.1	 Look at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=568.7s	568.7	 Oh, that was awesome. Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=571.1s	571.1	 Up here almost come on over here. I'm gonna get them away from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdp8Jf2Mo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=399&pp=iAQB&t=574.3s	574.3	 Distraction on the ground. Nice job. Hey, if you guys enjoyed this click thumbs up for gizmo
