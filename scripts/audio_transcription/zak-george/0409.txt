https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 Today we're gonna go over how to resolve resource guarding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=26.3s	26.3	 because Pancake, well, he's got quite the issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 with guarding things like bones and food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=31.9s	31.9	 Whoa, dude, chill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=33.3s	33.3	 Resource guarding is where your dog tends to protect something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 that's of value to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=37.4s	37.4	 They can growl or even snap at you trying to protect it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=40.8s	40.8	 Why do dogs guard resources?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=42.8s	42.8	 Well, it's not because they're mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 I mean, guarding things is very natural to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=46.5s	46.5	 I mean, think about small children, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=48.6s	48.6	 who get really protective of a new toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 In most cases, resource guarding involves food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 but sometimes they might be protecting their bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=55.5s	55.5	 or something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=56.5s	56.5	 With resource guarding, it's ideal to address this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=59.4s	59.4	 before it even gets started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=60.9s	60.9	 So you'll want to dedicate training sessions to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 outside of meal time or outside of giving your dog a bone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=66.6s	66.6	 for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 Just a general tip, it's a good idea to not work on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=70.1s	70.1	 when your dog is super hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=71.6s	71.6	 Let's see what happens when we put this down for Pancake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=74.5s	74.5	 and see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 If I go in, you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 He protects his bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=78.8s	78.8	 This is natural.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 Let's see, if I get close, you see how he starts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 I mean, that's a serious growl right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 That can turn into a potentially serious problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=86.9s	86.9	 I'm going to show you how to get that bone away from your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 and how to teach them not to be so protective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=91.9s	91.9	 of things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 The idea is to keep your dog from ever getting to this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=95.4s	95.4	 So the exercises we're going to cover today also work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=98.5s	98.5	 even if your dog hasn't yet developed this guarding issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=101.6s	101.6	 that many dogs have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=102.5s	102.5	 See, right now it's a little close,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 and I'm not quite so sure that he wouldn't nip at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 if I went to go take that bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=107.7s	107.7	 So I'm not yet ready to go in there and take that bone away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=110.2s	110.2	 How on earth are we going to get him to not protect that bone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 and give it up willingly?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 So the first thing I have to do is get his attention off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 of that bone with something better than the bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=118.6s	118.6	 Let me be very clear here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=119.7s	119.7	 You don't just want to rush into taking that bone away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 See, there's the growling emerging again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 So come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=125.3s	125.3	 Come on, you want some ham?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=126.2s	126.2	 I got this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=126.8s	126.8	 Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=130.7s	130.7	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 He's like, no, I know what you're up to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=134.8s	134.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=135.8s	135.8	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=136.3s	136.3	 I'm going to pick up the bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=137.7s	137.7	 If your dog wasn't responsive to being lured away from the bone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=140.9s	140.9	 you could always do something like this too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=143.4s	143.4	 You drop the ham like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 As you get near them, that puts you in a better position to pick it up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 and then reintroduce it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=150.2s	150.2	 We need to teach him some good manners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=151.8s	151.8	 I don't have a problem with pancake chewing on a bone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 but he's got to do so with manners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=155.9s	155.9	 See, most dogs aren't going to snap at you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=157.9s	157.9	 if you're holding it in your hand like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=159.5s	159.5	 I mean, some will, so be careful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 It's when they get full possession of it that they're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 I'm never letting this go ever again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=165.4s	165.4	 If you've taught a basic leave it to your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=167.2s	167.2	 it's usually a pretty easy transition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 to teach them to leave a bone or a toy alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=175.4s	175.4	 We're going to reward for compliance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=177.7s	177.7	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=179.2s	179.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 I'm even going to set it down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 And reward with a tiny piece of ham.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=185.1s	185.1	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=186.7s	186.7	 And see, what you're doing just by being repetitive is you're saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=189.2s	189.2	 look, I can interact with this too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=191.4s	191.4	 You can have it sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=192.7s	192.7	 I can have it sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=194.4s	194.4	 We have to teach our dogs the conduct we expect of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=266M5Tup9xc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=410&pp=iAQB&t=197.2s	197.2	 as we teach stuff like this.
