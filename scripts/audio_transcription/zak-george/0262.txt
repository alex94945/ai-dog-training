https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=3.3s	3.3	 least training with inertia. I'm Zach George. I train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=7.4s	7.4	 This is my new dog and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=11.4s	11.4	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=13.9s	13.9	 You can start from the beginning or you can pick up anywhere.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=23.3s	23.3	 your results will forever remain in motion. This is inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=27.8s	27.8	 Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 If you're training your dog, the basics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 something that can really help keep you on track is pup box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=36.7s	36.7	 Pup box is special because it's a monthly subscription box where they send you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 items that will help you train your dog based on their specific age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 And that's really important. For example, this is the three month box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 Let me show you what comes in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=48.2s	48.2	 The first thing you'll notice is that you get this detailed training guide on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 things you should be working on with a three month old dog. In this case,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 at three months old or three years old,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=55.8s	55.8	 you always want to make sure that you have treats on you when you're training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 your dog something new. This stays shut. So your dog can't steal your treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=61.8s	61.8	 A Kong is classic. This really helps keep your dog occupied when they're alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=65.6s	65.6	 They even give you peanut butter to put inside the Kong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 Dogs really like plush toys as well. Let's see if this one has a squeaker. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 Of course your dog doesn't have to be three months old to appreciate this toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 And we have some real top notch training treats here as well. These are salmon bites.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 Sweet tater fries. It's a nice, really desirable chew right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 So once your dog is past the puppy stage, like inertia is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 you'll get the adult box and oh my goodness. What is this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=91.8s	91.8	 Toys that bounce kind of crazy with these odd shapes can be really exciting to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=95.4s	95.4	 dogs. I can't recommend pup box enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 You can get 50% off of your first box when you go to pup box.com slash Zach and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=105.9s	105.9	 There's one thing that I've done to make my leash walking training with inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=109.6s	109.6	 much smoother. And that's what I want to go over with you guys today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=112.7s	112.7	 And you guys have definitely noticed on Instagram.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 So many of you have been requesting a deep dive and how I taught inertia her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 switch move switch just means she switches over from healing on one side of me to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 the other like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 I find it really useful to teach dogs to heal on either side of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=130.5s	130.5	 It can really help you when you're navigating a busy area or you're near a busy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 road. For example, if you're not thinking about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 it can easily become a habit for you to keep your dog on one side of you most of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=141.3s	141.3	 the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=141.8s	141.8	 And so your dog can become accustomed to walking only on one side of you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=145.9s	145.9	 even if you're not aware of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=147.3s	147.3	 This can really limit how maneuverable and flexible you and your dog are when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=151.1s	151.1	 you're out in public. For example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=152.7s	152.7	 here's a shot from a past training session with inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 A woman walks towards us and I don't know how this woman feels about dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=159.4s	159.4	 Maybe she doesn't like them. So I chose to switch inertia to my other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 This little switch move is the easiest way that I have found to get inertia to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=167.9s	167.9	 switch from one side to the other in a compact, efficient movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 When I first started training this to inertia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=174.4s	174.4	 I found that lure training was the way to go for sure. In fact, with inertia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=178.7s	178.7	 I just started teaching her how to use her back legs and her front legs a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 bit differently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=183.3s	183.3	 One of the ways I practiced this was by having her put her front feet on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=186.9s	186.9	 different surface, like a book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 And I encouraged her to rotate her back feet around in a circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 This got her at least comfortable with the concept of pivoting on her front feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=196.2s	196.2	 a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=198.4s	198.4	 Once inertia got really good at that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=200.5s	200.5	 I started prioritizing how to teach her to spin into that heel position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=204.9s	204.9	 The objective is basically to have her turn and pivot on those front feet like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 this so that I can eventually put her into the heel position. Turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=214.5s	214.5	 Okay. Oh, I like that. So she actually went the other way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 but she just volunteered that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=219.2s	219.2	 So I'm going to actually jackpot that because that was a beautiful looking turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=223.6s	223.6	 Yes. Good. I don't really want her going into that sit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=226.6s	226.6	 but I like that she's turning. So we're still early stages on this stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 And see right here, she's a bit confused. She's like, what do you mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=232.9s	232.9	 I want her to basically say standing and do this motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=235.8s	235.8	 That's what we're going for here. Wait, let me get her warmed up with weight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 Good turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=243.7s	243.7	 Still pretty good. Cause see, she's getting real close to my thighs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=246.6s	246.6	 Still a little in front of me, but I want her over here. But again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=249.1s	249.1	 we're not going to be that picky at this point in her training. Turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 Let me see if I can intercept that sit though. Turn. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=256.9s	256.9	 So I gave her an enthusiastic yes, just before her butt hit the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 And I'm hoping for her to be like, Whoa, I better not sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=262.8s	262.8	 I did something right, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=263.9s	263.9	 That's the reaction I'm trying to elicit from her stand. Wait, turn. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=269.0s	269.0	 Good. Right there. She didn't sit. Do you see how I intercepted her?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=271.8s	271.8	 Even though this is sloppy, I'm rewarding the fact that she didn't sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=274.9s	274.9	 So you have to really reward small efforts. Wait, look at me. Turn. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=280.5s	280.5	 Yes. Oh, that's so good. So this is new territory. Again, not a good heel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=284.6s	284.6	 but I'm trying to break this habit that she has of going into the sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=287.7s	287.7	 If you can teach your dog how to spin with a lure like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=291.2s	291.2	 then you can easily teach this too. This is a heavily lure dependent trick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=295.4s	295.4	 at least the way that I taught it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=296.7s	296.7	 I used a heavy lure to really guide her and teach her how to get into position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 right beside me. Once she was doing switch really well, while I stood still,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 I then wanted to prioritize having her be able to do that while we were on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=309.9s	309.9	 walk or in a busier setting, like a city or a neighborhood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 And when in new distracting places,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 I would lure her for an extended period of time because it really took her a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=318.9s	318.9	 while to grasp how to do this. When in a challenging environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=322.8s	322.8	 this is some kind of unusual muscle memory that you're asking your dog to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=326.6s	326.6	 acquire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=327.2s	327.2	 So helping them out with the lure to really encourage them to practice the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=332.2s	332.2	 I also practice this by calling her to me as well and asking her to spin into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=336.6s	336.6	 that heel position routinely. As she was learning this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=339.6s	339.6	 I really had to be choosy about the times that I really wanted to be insistent

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=347.5s	347.5	 there might've been so many distractions that she found it too overwhelming.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 I would try to find a less busy part of the city and practice there for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=356.1s	356.1	 So we're going to go out into the real world and see how inertia is doing on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=359.6s	359.6	 this today. In general,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 I like to have inertia on whichever side is farthest from the cars when we're

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=368.1s	368.1	 sometimes you may want to walk on either side for one reason or another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=371.5s	371.5	 You can see how this might be helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=372.8s	372.8	 If you see another pedestrian coming by being able to have your dog on either

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=380.3s	380.3	 Even though I'd like to have her on one side away from the road as a general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=383.9s	383.9	 rule, maybe there's a dog in someone's yard.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcvVv4DJk4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=263&pp=iAQB&t=390.3s	390.3	 That's further away from the dog.
