https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 We just got done filming our Q&A video. It's a long video. I hope you guys are gonna like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 If you have any questions that you want to ask me, I might do a follow-up video to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=9.9s	9.9	 So make sure you leave them in the comments below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 It was really fun, so I hope you ask a good question. Some of the questions here were very interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 Let's just record it. Let's just do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 A little while ago, I made a post on Facebook asking you if you had general questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 I realized it's been an eternity of years since I've taken the time out to sit here and answer your questions that are not about dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 So I figured it's time for an update and to answer some of those questions that people ask a lot and things that I've been meaning to share with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=39.5s	39.5	 I think we just need to get to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=41.2s	41.2	 First question is from Diana. She says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=44.4s	44.4	 I've been with you for a little over a year, but I would love to learn about your history if you don't mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=49.8s	49.8	 Oh, okay. So just like my general dog training history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=52.4s	52.4	 Basically, I started training dogs about 10 years ago when I got my dog Venus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 I was really interested in the sport of dog Frisbee, which is one of the reasons I got Venus because I really wanted to compete.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 I love Frisbee. It looked like a fun thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 Did that. We won several competitions, competed for a couple of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=71.5s	71.5	 And it was a lot of fun. As I started really enjoying the process of teaching her, I realized, well, if I'm going to do it, I'm real serious about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 I want to do this full time. So I quit my job of selling real estate to train dogs, but I needed someone to paint me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 And this is a question I get a lot. How do I become a dog trainer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=93.8s	93.8	 What I did, I went to my local PetSmart. Well, actually not too local.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=97.1s	97.1	 It was about an hour away because all the other PetSmart had dog trainers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=101.2s	101.2	 PetSmart is a national dog or national pet supply chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=104.9s	104.9	 For those of you that don't know, that's Indy Scrap Chain. You might hear her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=109.1s	109.1	 I got a job at PetSmart. We quickly became the top producing dog training PetSmart in the entire world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=115.4s	115.4	 Pretty quickly. I was really proud of that. I'm still proud of that to this day because I had a waiting list months long into my class and it was just fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=124.2s	124.2	 So that in turn gave me a ton of experience. I literally worked with thousands of dogs at PetSmart in my two years that I worked there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 I started to realize that I wanted to do a little bit more with my dog training career.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=137.1s	137.1	 By this time, Venus and Supernova and Alpha, I had three dogs. I realized I wanted to perform with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=144.8s	144.8	 So I had an opportunity to join up with the Extreme Canine Stuff Dog Show who's still very, very successful today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 As a matter of fact, I was just talking to Chris not that long ago about some stuff and he's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=157.2s	157.2	 So some of the best times in dog training that I can remember took place with the Extreme Canine Show. It's a lot of fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 Around 2006, YouTube started to become a thing. So I started making YouTube videos on dog training, video blogs, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=173.3s	173.3	 I just enjoyed editing. I enjoyed being in front of the camera and I realized I wanted to do more with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 So I sent Animal Planet, the network, a letter one day pitching a show and I asked them if they'd be interested in working with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=186.4s	186.4	 We worked out a television show concept. I did 20 episodes of a show called Super Fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 Though you might not know this, the working title of Super Fetch was Fetch Me a Beer. That's what we were going to call the show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=199.8s	199.8	 Fortunately, the network changed their mind. I was thrilled about that. I never liked the title.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 So Super Fetch was the show. By the way, you can watch that on Netflix today if you have Netflix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=211.5s	211.5	 I don't know if it's available internationally or what. Most recently, I did a show in the UK on the BBC or Children's BBC called Who Let the Dogs Out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=220.9s	220.9	 which is basically, I describe it as American Idol for young British dog trainers under the age of 14 or 15 or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=229.8s	229.8	 Basically, we were looking for the most talented young dog trainer in all of Britain. So that was a lot of fun to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=238.8s	238.8	 I really, really enjoyed doing that show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 Bringing you to present day, I'm with my beautiful girlfriend Brianna here in Louisiana and she can't come to me in Atlanta. Tell them why, Bri.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 I'm in school. I have to finish getting my degree here in New Orleans because if I transfer, I just, it would, I would lose a lot of credits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=256.3s	256.3	 Did you know in the UK, if you say you're in school, it means you're like in like little kids school or high school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=261.8s	261.8	 Well, I'm at university.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=263.5s	263.5	 University, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 Yeah, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=266.1s	266.1	 I'm getting my biology degree. So Zach is waiting for me to finish and we're just hanging out in New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=271.9s	271.9	 Yeah, so I'm here hanging out with Bri doing dog training classes, having a great time. New Orleans is a fantastic city.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=278.4s	278.4	 Next question is from Del. Del is Dewey, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=282.1s	282.1	 One of my current students actually. Yeah, that's cool. Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 Del says...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 Dewey, yes. He's a West High Loterior. He's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=288.6s	288.6	 Oh, cool. I mean...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=289.4s	289.4	 He has his own Facebook page.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=290.6s	290.6	 He does?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=291.3s	291.3	 Yeah, he does. He's like hugely popular.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=293.3s	293.3	 Dewey, shout out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=295.3s	295.3	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 Del says, we want to hear from Bri. So tell us, what is it really like being around Zach's energy all the time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=304.6s	304.6	 What's that like? Being around life?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=308.3s	308.3	 Gosh, I didn't prepare an answer for this question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 You know, I'm a normal guy. I'm just like any other guy. Well, maybe you've made enough like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=315.4s	315.4	 I don't think you're just like any other guy, but I do find you very easy to be around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 I am never bored. You know, we always have something exciting to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=324.9s	324.9	 What people should understand, when there's a camera on, you're going to have a lot more energy and stuff too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=330.9s	330.9	 So the version of me you might see out there might be a little bit more energetic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=336.7s	336.7	 I mean, I do just kind of chill out sometimes, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=339.3s	339.3	 A little bit, but you still... Zach's a very good dancer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=343.8s	343.8	 You're not going to put that in, are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 I think I'm a great dancer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=348.9s	348.9	 Next question is from Kirsten.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=351.0s	351.0	 Or is it Kirsten?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=352.1s	352.1	 Or Kirsten.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 I'm not sure. Anyway, what's the question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=355.1s	355.1	 The question is, what TV show are you doing now if you're doing one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=359.7s	359.7	 Until I work with a network that I feel is forward thinking and embraces the message
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=368.1s	368.1	 that I have about dog training and the way to connect with our dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=371.4s	371.4	 I'm not just dying to get back into TV or anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=375.7s	375.7	 To me, the good thing about YouTube like this is you can get your message out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=379.9s	379.9	 to thousands, millions over the years of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=383.6s	383.6	 And I find that to be so much more effective because that's what resonates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=387.2s	387.2	 Do you know what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=388.3s	388.3	 When you don't have to run something by somebody to be approved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=392.5s	392.5	 and you can just put out what you want to put out, then I think that's a lot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=396.3s	396.3	 a lot more authentic, a lot more real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=398.3s	398.3	 You know what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=399.3s	399.3	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=400.0s	400.0	 I really respect the way that you are not willing to compromise very much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=406.1s	406.1	 when you're putting something out that has your name on it because you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 a really important message that you're trying to get across and it would undermine it if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=414.7s	414.7	 compromise in that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=416.2s	416.2	 The next question is from Jasmine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 I like this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=419.5s	419.5	 What is your proudest moment as a dog trainer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=424.9s	424.9	 That's a good question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=426.8s	426.8	 That one caught me a bit off guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=428.6s	428.6	 Proudest moment, I would say, and I mean, this might sound a little like not very proud,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=434.9s	434.9	 but every time when people take the time to tell someone about this dog trainer they saw on YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=441.4s	441.4	 or whatever, or they share a link or a post, or I get an email that says,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=445.7s	445.7	 your training is really working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=447.0s	447.0	 I want to thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=448.0s	448.0	 It helps a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=449.0s	449.0	 I mean, those are like the little moments every day that I get that make me proud to do what I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=455.0s	455.0	 There is no big moment that I say that was my proudest moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=459.4s	459.4	 but it's kind of a culmination of all these things that equal one big proud moment, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=464.3s	464.3	 The next question is from Nadia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=467.4s	467.4	 Do you feel that with dog training that every dog is cookie cutter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=471.0s	471.0	 that the same techniques that work on one may not work on another?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=475.3s	475.3	 Uh, the only techniques that are going to work universally are techniques that are catered to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=480.0s	480.0	 individual dog and techniques that are positive, loving, and authentic in their intention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=485.6s	485.6	 No, you can't teach every dog the same way, and the same way that you can't teach a person,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=489.7s	489.7	 every person, in the same way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=492.0s	492.0	 Dogs are exactly like people in the fact that everyone is an individual and learns differently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=497.6s	497.6	 and you have to connect with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=498.8s	498.8	 That's why I promote the bond with our dogs first and foremost at dog training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=503.3s	503.3	 and knowing your individual dog and prioritizing communication,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=506.3s	506.3	 because every dog is different and you have to understand them in order to get results with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=510.8s	510.8	 Next question is from Donna.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=512.6s	512.6	 Where did you meet your amazing girlfriend?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=516.2s	516.2	 Bree's most amazing girl I've ever known, uh, sincerely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=519.5s	519.5	 Uh, smart, beautiful, keeps me on my toes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=523.1s	523.1	 That's not the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=524.5s	524.5	 She's, well, I, I, but it's true though, she's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=527.8s	527.8	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=528.4s	528.4	 Some people, you guys may not know that she's amazing,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=535.0s	535.0	 So where did you meet me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=536.7s	536.7	 Well, I was doing a project with the oil spill, uh, for a company,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=540.3s	540.3	 and I came down here, I was filming something, and I met you because you were volunteering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=544.7s	544.7	 Well, I actually was volunteering with the Audubon Institute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=548.3s	548.3	 I was helping, like, seagulls and birds and stuff that were coming in with oil on them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=552.7s	552.7	 collecting them and bringing them to a place that could clean them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=555.4s	555.4	 But I also had heard that the SPCA was collecting donations of pet food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=561.3s	561.3	 for people who could no longer afford to feed their pets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=563.4s	563.4	 because they had lost a lot of income due to the oil spill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=566.7s	566.7	 And I heard that Zach was coming down to help with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=569.8s	569.8	 I was interested in meeting him, because I knew him on Twitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=573.0s	573.0	 So I tweeted at him and he said that you would be willing to meet me in, uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=576.9s	576.9	 the rest is history, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=579.0s	579.0	 Next question is from Katie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=581.0s	581.0	 Do you miss the Conyers Pet Smart?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=584.0s	584.0	 Let me see that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=587.8s	587.8	 Katie is actually an old student from back in the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=591.4s	591.4	 Uh, well, you know, I talked about that smart earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=594.0s	594.0	 Conyers was the town that I worked in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=597.0s	597.0	 Uh, good hearing from you, by the way, Katie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=599.2s	599.2	 I hope your dogs are doing good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=600.4s	600.4	 She was an agility competitor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=602.5s	602.5	 Cool!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=604.7s	604.7	 Really good trainer, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=605.7s	605.7	 Really good instinct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=606.7s	606.7	 I love working with younger people, although, what, she's gotta be 25 now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=611.6s	611.6	 Goodness, that was a while ago.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=615.9s	615.9	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=616.9s	616.9	 She was probably about 14, 15 at the time, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=619.5s	619.5	 Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=622.2s	622.2	 Her dad was really, like, uh, hands-on, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=625.9s	625.9	 And they, the whole family was really good about working with the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=629.6s	629.6	 So I think they took every class I offered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=632.4s	632.4	 So it was a lot of fun.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=635.4s	635.4	 We have so much fun when people move on from class to class,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=640.3s	640.3	 Yeah, because I offer different levels of classes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=642.7s	642.7	 But anyway, um...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=644.1s	644.1	 So do you miss the Conyers Pet Smart?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=645.8s	645.8	 Well, I miss Katie, first of all.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=702.7s	702.7	 As far as YouTube, I hope I do that for a very long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=705.8s	705.8	 I'm excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=706.4s	706.4	 You'll be doing that for the rest of your life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=708.2s	708.2	 That to me right now, it's hard to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=710.2s	710.2	 I see myself as an old man still making videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=713.6s	713.6	 when I'm 70, 80 years old if I'm able to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=716.6s	716.6	 If that's the thing or whatever the current thing or equivalent is at that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=721.2s	721.2	 I may take breaks from time to time, but I love making videos for YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=726.0s	726.0	 So maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=727.2s	727.2	 And whether or not it's dog training specifically,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=729.6s	729.6	 I do think that you will be promoting the advancement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=734.6s	734.6	 of the way that people think about their dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=736.6s	736.6	 and communicate with their dogs for the rest of your life in some way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=740.2s	740.2	 Oh, that's central to the, yeah, to everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=742.8s	742.8	 Yeah, even if I completely change careers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=744.9s	744.9	 dogs is something I will always be passionate about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=746.9s	746.9	 I can't change that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=748.2s	748.2	 And increasing the status of the domestic dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=751.5s	751.5	 and bringing it to where it belongs is vital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=755.0s	755.0	 to something that I'm passionate about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=756.8s	756.8	 What do I mean by that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=757.6s	757.6	 I mean giving them credit for being smart,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=759.4s	759.4	 beings and not patronizing them by assuming they only understand one word at a time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=764.8s	764.8	 or by putting a choke collar on them or a prong collar, as you know, if you follow me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=769.9s	769.9	 Not a fan of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=770.8s	770.8	 So I think all those things really undermine the intelligence of the domestic dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=776.5s	776.5	 Dogs are much smarter than many people give them credit for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=779.3s	779.3	 That's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=779.7s	779.7	 But you guys probably understand that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=782.2s	782.2	 Yeah, I mean, I hope so, or I'm not doing my job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=784.9s	784.9	 From Steph.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=790.0s	790.0	 And if you did, would you recommend a school or program?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=793.0s	793.0	 I get this question all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=796.7s	796.7	 There are a lot of programs out there you can do to become a certified dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=801.3s	801.3	 However, there's nothing governmental out there that requires you to get any certification.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=806.3s	806.3	 Anybody can call themselves a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=810.3s	810.3	 I did not go to any type of school, and I've talked about this several times before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=815.4s	815.4	 My experience, I mean, you know, my experience comes from working with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=819.2s	819.2	 thousands of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=820.2s	820.2	 That's really what I consider to be my school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=822.6s	822.6	 Is there anything wrong with going to a school?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=824.5s	824.5	 Not at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=825.2s	825.2	 I don't think there's anything wrong at all with going to a school
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=828.1s	828.1	 that promotes positive training out there at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=831.2s	831.2	 Some are good, some are not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=832.6s	832.6	 It really, you just have to do your homework with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=835.4s	835.4	 But I've gotten most of my experience just real world training, working with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=839.4s	839.4	 Worked with approximately 3000 dogs now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=843.0s	843.0	 There's not much you don't see when you work with that many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=847.6s	847.6	 But I think that if you do your homework and you find a really good school,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=851.1s	851.1	 that you should consider that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=852.8s	852.8	 I mean, education is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=854.0s	854.0	 There's also a ton of information available on the internet as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=857.5s	857.5	 I mean, I'm constantly learning what new people have to say about dog training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=861.8s	861.8	 by reading and watching high quality YouTube videos from good people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=867.7s	867.7	 That's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=868.3s	868.3	 And you're still consistently working with hundreds of new dogs all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=872.5s	872.5	 In our classes here, I mean, I've been learning a lot from those dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=876.1s	876.1	 And I'm sure that a lot of it you already knew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=877.9s	877.9	 But you know, you still see new things every day with that too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=882.0s	882.0	 Real world experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=883.5s	883.5	 In one way, I'm very glad that I didn't take the more traditional route
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=888.2s	888.2	 to become a professional dog trainer by doing the certifications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=893.2s	893.2	 Because I didn't allow it to keep me tunnel vision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=897.4s	897.4	 I think the mistake that a lot of professional dog trainers make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=901.3s	901.3	 who attend these schools and get their certification
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=904.0s	904.0	 is they assume that all that is scientifically known is all there is to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=909.8s	909.8	 And that is something that's just not true because every, I mean, I still work with new dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=915.8s	915.8	 Every week I'm working with new dogs and they're coming in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=918.7s	918.7	 And you still see like the depth is so, it goes very, very deep with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=925.2s	925.2	 And there's a lot more than than operant and classical conditioning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=928.4s	928.4	 when it comes to teaching dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=930.0s	930.0	 Right. Like we said before, every dog is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=932.5s	932.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=933.7s	933.7	 Yeah, it's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=934.6s	934.6	 It's true because in order to be a really good dog trainer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=938.0s	938.0	 you have to connect with the individual dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=940.5s	940.5	 And that's something that is not stressed enough, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=943.7s	943.7	 Next question is from Monica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=947.1s	947.1	 Which trainers have inspired you that you personally admire and why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=952.3s	952.3	 See, that's a tough question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=954.7s	954.7	 What inspired me to become a dog trainer was the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=959.0s	959.0	 And the complexity of the dog and their capabilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=963.8s	963.8	 That's what amazed me when I got Venus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=966.8s	966.8	 So Venus is who inspires you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=970.5s	970.5	 Yeah, I suppose so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=972.5s	972.5	 I see why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=973.3s	973.3	 No, there are a lot of trainers out there that I admire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=976.3s	976.3	 But is there a trainer I look up to that I want to be like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=978.9s	978.9	 Not really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=980.0s	980.0	 And that's because I'm more concerned not with that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=983.0s	983.0	 but with understanding what makes dogs so smart and enjoying their energy and their enthusiasm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=990.2s	990.2	 and their authenticity and their intelligence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=992.6s	992.6	 That's my inspiration to be a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=996.1s	996.1	 Next question is from Jade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=998.2s	998.2	 Jade says, what do you struggle with as a trainer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1003.8s	1003.8	 That's an interesting question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1005.8s	1005.8	 Yeah, there's struggle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1009.1s	1009.1	 I get a little frustrated sometimes that it's difficult to get a lot of the mainstream public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1016.2s	1016.2	 to accept that dogs are really intelligent animals full of depth and understanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1022.2s	1022.2	 and that you don't need to put a training collar or a prong collar around their neck to teach them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1032.0s	1032.0	 Okay, one more question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1033.8s	1033.8	 The last one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1035.3s	1035.3	 I feel like I'm drinking something every time I read the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1037.8s	1037.8	 That's not something I drink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1039.0s	1039.0	 It is. That's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1039.8s	1039.8	 That's okay. I drink when you talk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1042.1s	1042.1	 I understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1043.0s	1043.0	 Okay, last question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1044.6s	1044.6	 This is from Owen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1046.9s	1046.9	 What is your thing when you're not training dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1049.8s	1049.8	 Ooh, like what do I enjoy doing when I'm not training dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1052.4s	1052.4	 Well, at the moment, I mean, I love editing, video editing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1056.8s	1056.8	 I think that's what's funny is I like video and I've got a lot of things, believe me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1063.4s	1063.4	 but I was thinking about this actually earlier today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1066.6s	1066.6	 The thing about editing, and you can probably comment on this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1069.7s	1069.7	 it's so detail oriented frame by frame.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1072.6s	1072.6	 You want to make the exact right cut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1074.6s	1074.6	 You want it to come off exactly right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1077.4s	1077.4	 It's a very detail oriented activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1082.2s	1082.2	 It seems like an art form.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1083.8s	1083.8	 When I'm watching you edit videos, it really,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1087.2s	1087.2	 the way that you are reminds me of the way that I am when I'm trying to like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1091.8s	1091.8	 play the piano or paint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1093.3s	1093.3	 It's really an artistic state of mind that you have to be in to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1097.0s	1097.0	 have this vision and make it all come to reality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1099.5s	1099.5	 You're very, very picky about making sure that everything is perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1105.3s	1105.3	 And that's how an artist is, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1108.6s	1108.6	 Yeah, you just want to tell the story the way it's supposed to be told.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1113.8s	1113.8	 And that's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1115.9s	1115.9	 The irony though is because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1118.2s	1118.2	 I hate details in every other area of life outside of dog training and video editing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1123.8s	1123.8	 I'm like, you know, okay, I've got a big picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1125.8s	1125.8	 This is what we need to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1127.0s	1127.0	 This is what needs to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1128.8s	1128.8	 Somebody else do the details, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1132.6s	1132.6	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1133.1s	1133.1	 You're doing amazing, John.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1134.2s	1134.2	 You're much better than I am.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1136.6s	1136.6	 But for some reason, those two activities, I love the details.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1140.9s	1140.9	 I mean, they're so detailed, so intricate, and it's a lot of fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1144.9s	1144.9	 Maybe I just overdose on that, and that's why I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1147.4s	1147.4	 That's why I don't like doing details anywhere else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1149.5s	1149.5	 Maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1150.2s	1150.2	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1150.8s	1150.8	 Anyway, so that's the last question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1152.7s	1152.7	 I hope you guys enjoyed the video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3RBighAbA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=620&pp=iAQB&t=1156.2s	1156.2	 Make sure you leave your questions below that you would like me to answer, dog training or otherwise.
