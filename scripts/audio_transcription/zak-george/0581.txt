https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=13.4s	13.4	 Those first several weeks of having a puppy should be dedicated to building communication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 After all, our dogs have no idea that doing something natural like biting us or chewing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=22.6s	22.6	 things up is not acceptable to us.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 That communication doesn't happen overnight, but in this video, I'm going to show you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 exactly what to do in order to get started and minimize that time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=66.9s	66.9	 stage chewing things, biting things, and he's just like so interested in everything around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=72.1s	72.1	 him like puppies are.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=74.1s	74.1	 Why don't you show me a couple of things that you've done?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 We work with him every day on sit and giving paw and lying down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=80.9s	80.9	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=85.9s	85.9	 What kind of dog is he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=87.3s	87.3	 We have no idea.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=92.9s	92.9	 Anything from part catahoula, lab, Australian Shepherd, Roddy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 Our biggest issue with him right now is biting when he's playing and it's when he's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 excited and he'll start kissing and it'll turn into bites and it's starting to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 hurt because he's getting bigger and bigger by the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=110.5s	110.5	 We don't want people to be afraid of him and we don't want him to keep doing this as he

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Dogs bite for a couple of reasons at this age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 A, they're teething and B, they're interacting with the world because they don't have hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=122.2s	122.2	 That's how they grab things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=123.2s	123.2	 That's how they investigate things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=124.5s	124.5	 Michael calls him a land shark because he just runs towards us, mouth open, just coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 at us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 So some days it's worse than others but he just doesn't understand that it hurts us and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 so that's kind of an issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 And right now you might notice that I'm picking him up right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 I had him on his back just to kind of cradle him and see how comfortable he was being held
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=144.8s	144.8	 by a person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 You know, it's important that when we have a dog, if we do have a dog this young, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 we get them used to being touched kind of firmly, you know, because when people come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 up to your dog they're going to pat them like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 So it's a really good idea to desensitize them, massage their paws, wherever possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=159.8s	159.8	 Because, I mean, look, right there they can interpret this as play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=163.3s	163.3	 When a human thinks they're just petting a dog, a dog might think, oh, this person's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 playing with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=167.2s	167.2	 Biting like this, so natural, so expected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=169.1s	169.1	 I mean, at this age, 10, 11 weeks, it's not realistic to eliminate play biting altogether.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=174.3s	174.3	 Why don't we get down here low to the ground and work with him a little bit, let him walk around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 I still do feel the need to warn a stranger that he will bite or could bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 Oh, there's the bite right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 Ouch!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=186.8s	186.8	 Got my finger pretty good, but that's, you know, that's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=190.2s	190.2	 That's what you sign on for when you get a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=193.3s	193.3	 He seems to be kind of a moderate play biter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=196.5s	196.5	 The first thing I think we should do is teach him kind of a basic leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 Now you can see he already knows I've got this real turkey in my hand right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 I'm just going to go over this really quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=204.3s	204.3	 I have a full video in the description that will show you how to teach your dog to leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=207.5s	207.5	 something alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=208.5s	208.5	 But right here, when he backs off, I'm just going to go ahead and reward him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=211.9s	211.9	 So cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=213.3s	213.3	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 There's more going on than just teaching him to leave something alone here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=217.4s	217.4	 The big purpose of teaching leave it is so that we can communicate to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 No, that's not what I want, because if we just go up to them and get frustrated every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 time they bite us, they're not going to understand what the problem is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=227.1s	227.1	 So it's good to establish that clear communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 You know, remember, those first three, four, five months of working with a dog is all about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=234.4s	234.4	 building communication.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 And that's totally normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=241.9s	241.9	 That's why we teach them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=242.9s	242.9	 That's the point.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 it alone as I open my palm.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=308.7s	308.7	 a dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 a blessing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=322.2s	322.2	 If we know that he's likely to do it anyway, let's show him what is acceptable to chew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=326.5s	326.5	 on or bite on rather than getting on him when he bites us.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=338.5s	338.5	 A, it shows them what to chew on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=340.6s	340.6	 B, it is the beginning of teaching your dog tug of war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=343.8s	343.8	 Now, tug of war is one of the most underestimated rewards in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=349.5s	349.5	 And most puppies will play it instinctively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=351.6s	351.6	 Now I see he's good about tugging it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=352.9s	352.9	 Is he good about letting it go?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=359.9s	359.9	 What's kind of ironic about teaching a dog to not bite is that if you can teach them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=364.2s	364.2	 to bite when you ask and stop when you ask, that you can really make a lot of progress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=369.3s	369.3	 here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=373.7s	373.7	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=375.4s	375.4	 Do be careful because their aim isn't very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=377.5s	377.5	 Like when he jumps like that, they might get you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=379.2s	379.2	 So you got to make sure you're using the right kind of toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=383.2s	383.2	 Just wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=384.2s	384.2	 See it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=385.2s	385.2	 We're just making it less interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 That's all we're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=390.4s	390.4	 I'm not trying to pull it away from him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=391.6s	391.6	 I'm going to wait for him to let go on his own accord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=394.4s	394.4	 Yes!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=397.9s	397.9	 I could come prepared with a toy and encourage him to put his teeth on that and we could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=401.9s	401.9	 make a training session of it like, hey, you can bite this, but you also need to let go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=405.4s	405.4	 of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=406.4s	406.4	 So you need to be prepared to kind of teach both of those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=408.9s	408.9	 Or if you have like a real severe case or a dog that's in a really, really bitey mood,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=414.4s	414.4	 then you would want to come armed with your good food rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=417.8s	417.8	 I'm going to try it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=519.3s	519.3	 Be patient, wait for him to let go like we talked about, and then try and pet him.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=531.8s	531.8	 Let go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KQegi4r8k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=582&pp=iAQB&t=545.6s	545.6	 Let go.
