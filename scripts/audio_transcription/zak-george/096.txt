https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today's video, if you watch till the end, will solve 99% of all of your dog training problems. Guaranteed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=7.1s	7.1	 I'm Zach. I'm a professional dog trainer and this is my wife, Bree, and we're showing you how we train our dogs everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=13.5s	13.5	 If you like dogs, subscribe to our channel. Our new episode starts now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 Inertia, you know, everyone wants an update from you to see how you're doing. I think it's time for a pup quiz.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 We really need to make sure your basics are down. Lie down. Stand, sit, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 Come. Heel. But my understanding, Inertia, is that you're an honor student.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=37.8s	37.8	 This month's box couldn't be more on. Bark to school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=41.1s	41.1	 Gonna have to do something extra special to earn a gold star, Inertia. And no sleeping in class. Weave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=47.5s	47.5	 I love how Bark keeps everything so fresh and so interesting because that keeps my dog interested in training, which is huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=54.2s	54.2	 Multiple texture toys like this, she goes crazy for. So the detail and dimension of Bark toys will certainly exceed your expectations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 They do mine. Good. Go get it. Job well done today. I'm going to give these to her later. These chews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 Don't forget, we've got to put your homework in your backpack. It's like so many toys in one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 I think you might be at the super chewer level, Inertia. Super chewer boxes for those dogs who are really tough on toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 These are about the most durable school supplies. I mean, dog toys that I've ever seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 Oh, it's a pencil sharpener and a pencil. Obviously, you can put treats in here like that and you'll get really high quality treats with every box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=90.2s	90.2	 You can see how many treats I put in. But when I turn it over, look at that. Your dog has to work a little extra hard to get these to come out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=96.2s	96.2	 These toys are so valuable. You're going to have to practically do somersaults to get a reward. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=102.3s	102.3	 I think Inertia gets an A plus. All of you can try Bark Box out and get a free box when you sign up for a subscription at barkbox.com slash dog training or superchewer.com
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=112.8s	112.8	 I'll have links below. I think a thing that a lot of us have in common on this channel is that we're interested in learning the science and the art of teaching and raising dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=122.2s	122.2	 We find ourselves in northern Montana today surrounded by wildlife, water and lots of woods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 And I want to share something with you today that really fundamentally changed the way that I look at training dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=133.9s	133.9	 I'm reminded about a metaphor that I used to give to my dog training students all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=137.8s	137.8	 That is training a dog is a lot like making a campfire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=141.3s	141.3	 And so what do I mean by that? I mean, first you have to have a spark, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=144.3s	144.3	 And sometimes that spark is the hardest bit to get the thing going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=148.1s	148.1	 Ouch. I found myself thinking many times, how am I supposed to get a dog to pay attention to me if they're constantly biting and jumping and only sometimes interested in what I'm offering them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=158.7s	158.7	 Much less teach them how to be super well mannered like all of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 The first rule of building a campfire is to set yourself up for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 So I've got some of this wonderful dry moss I'm finding on the ground everywhere here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 Some little twigs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 We want this fire to fuel itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 We don't want to take shortcuts like putting lighter fluid or gasoline on the fire because those results are artificial and they're short lived.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=182.7s	182.7	 That's not authentic. Methodically setting up the fire like this is the equivalent of setting up our dog's environment for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 I've never had so much pressure to actually produce a good campfire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=194.5s	194.5	 I mean, I've really put myself on the spot here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=196.4s	196.4	 You don't want to rush this part of the process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 If you've ever built a fire before, you'll know if you just try to burn a log, that's pretty tough to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=204.3s	204.3	 It's really important to have a good foundation, something that's likely to succeed so it doesn't just smolder out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=210.5s	210.5	 You know, you can see we have some dried moss, some twigs, things that are easy to burn, things that are likely to be successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 We're not trying to do everything all at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=221.4s	221.4	 Because we want to keep the process as smooth as possible, we need to make things extremely likely to work to succeed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=228.4s	228.4	 And we want to do that early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=229.7s	229.7	 Whereas here I'm finding easy things to burn with our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 We need to find things that are easy for them to understand and accomplish at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 That was a real natural look at me when I asked for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=239.8s	239.8	 Inersia, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 The way to teach them language, I think anyway, is to be very purposeful about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=244.8s	244.8	 I don't exactly know how to make a campfire with like a flint or two sticks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=250.1s	250.1	 So I will be using a lighter, but I think the metaphor still holds true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 Now, the moment of truth, the spark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 How does this thing work?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=260.1s	260.1	 Is this broken?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=261.2s	261.2	 Oh, I think it's childproof.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=265.1s	265.1	 See, one click, it didn't spark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 Man, this lighter doesn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=269.7s	269.7	 This lighter is broken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=271.1s	271.1	 This would be very frustrating if your lighter stopped working when you're trying to build a fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 You know what else is frustrating, though?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=277.6s	277.6	 Oh, Inersia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=279.2s	279.2	 You're going to make me work, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=280.6s	280.6	 A dog that doesn't know how to pay attention to you yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=284.4s	284.4	 Oh, it started to spark, but it won't stay lit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=288.5s	288.5	 I mean, a second ago, it was fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=290.1s	290.1	 Inersia, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=291.7s	291.7	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=292.7s	292.7	 And now it's like it's not even functioning right anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=295.7s	295.7	 Ow, oh my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=298.4s	298.4	 OK, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=300.3s	300.3	 This is so delicate right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=302.6s	302.6	 Going to light it from the bottom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=304.2s	304.2	 Want a strong foundation here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=306.8s	306.8	 So I'm lighting it in several places here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=308.7s	308.7	 Right now, I'm just getting smoke, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=310.5s	310.5	 It's not coming easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=311.5s	311.5	 It's not like, oh, just light the fire and you have a great campfire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 And if we try to skip steps in between, like trying to burn a big log, that's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=320.4s	320.4	 expose a flaw with my process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 She's in a leash-biting frenzy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=325.6s	325.6	 Looks like I need to slow down a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=327.4s	327.4	 Pretty sure Inersia thinks we've lost it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 We're living outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 Although she seems to be enjoying it just fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=334.7s	334.7	 She's got dirt all over her face, you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 Oh, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=338.0s	338.0	 This fire is so delicate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=339.9s	339.9	 At this point, you have to really be patient with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=342.7s	342.7	 You can't rush the process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=344.0s	344.0	 Can't get content here just because I started to have a little success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=347.5s	347.5	 No, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=348.5s	348.5	 Or else it'll just start smoking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=350.9s	350.9	 And we just had rain, so I've got to be extra patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=354.1s	354.1	 Sometimes blowing on it helps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=356.7s	356.7	 Sometimes playing tug with a dog can really rekindle their interest in you and learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 And I have my first twig on fire now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=363.5s	363.5	 You know, twigs stay on fire longer than the dry vegetation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=368.1s	368.1	 So I might need to reposition a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=369.9s	369.9	 I might need to adjust my strategy here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=371.7s	371.7	 And maybe I'll put this twig a little over here where it's starting to get traction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=374.9s	374.9	 In other words, I want to be flexible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=377.1s	377.1	 I don't just want to assume the fire is going to work because I thought I designed it exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=381.5s	381.5	 right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=382.5s	382.5	 She's like, wait a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=383.5s	383.5	 I don't understand this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=384.5s	384.5	 See, she's bucking up there a little bit saying, I want to go this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 So you can see there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=391.3s	391.3	 Just being silly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=392.5s	392.5	 I became way more interesting to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=394.8s	394.8	 Little smoky at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=396.0s	396.0	 Doesn't really look like a perfect campfire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 Man, I've been working on this for kind of a long time now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=400.8s	400.8	 Many, many minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=401.8s	401.8	 It's not going as easy as I had hoped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 And see, I think this is the point where we're training our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=407.8s	407.8	 Sometimes we're like, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=409.1s	409.1	 It just doesn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=410.2s	410.2	 I have not done something right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=411.8s	411.8	 I can't get the fire to get going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=415.1s	415.1	 Hey, let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=416.9s	416.9	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=418.8s	418.8	 I have a hunch that if we stick with it and we're patient and we're consistent, we put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=423.6s	423.6	 in our time, we will eventually get something going here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=428.5s	428.5	 OK, let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=430.8s	430.8	 Yes, he did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=432.3s	432.3	 He did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=433.3s	433.3	 We did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=435.9s	435.9	 But look how much time it takes in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=438.7s	438.7	 You can't take your attention off the fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=440.6s	440.6	 If your attention is divided, the fire probably goes out at this stage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=444.1s	444.1	 And then all of a sudden it starts to rain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=446.7s	446.7	 Now I've really got the odds stacked against me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=449.8s	449.8	 Sometimes unforeseen things happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=451.8s	451.8	 That doesn't mean we give up on our fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=453.6s	453.6	 Well, depending on how bad the rain is, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=456.1s	456.1	 We're starting to get somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=457.3s	457.3	 But again, if you get overconfident at this point in the game, then it's like you run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=462.4s	462.4	 the real risk of losing all your progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=465.5s	465.5	 Just like a dog, when the fire is young, it requires the most attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=469.1s	469.1	 Oh, yeah, we got a flame going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=471.6s	471.6	 But I'm also feeling raindrops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=474.7s	474.7	 And still, even now, as it's getting going, if I tried to put a big log on there, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=478.9s	478.9	 could imagine what might happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=480.2s	480.2	 It could really smother the whole thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=482.6s	482.6	 Much better to take lots of little steps to ensure success first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=486.4s	486.4	 It always helps to have a patient frame of mind, train in environments that make you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=494.4s	494.4	 Now that the fire is getting warmer and ready to handle a tougher challenge, I think I can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=498.4s	498.4	 now start to put a slightly bigger piece of wood on the fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=501.9s	501.9	 Here's a real nice piece of wood here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=504.0s	504.0	 I cut this one myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=505.5s	505.5	 Cut all of this myself, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=507.4s	507.4	 I think I don't know what I'm doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=509.6s	509.6	 Really?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=513.5s	513.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=514.9s	514.9	 Are you videoing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=516.9s	516.9	 I'm going to continue to set the fire up for success by presenting the nice, easy to burn

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=523.3s	523.3	 And even still, it can be tempting to put lots more giant pieces of wood on here so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=530.5s	530.5	 that you can kind of forget about it for a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=532.5s	532.5	 No, try to do too much too soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=535.5s	535.5	 You guarantee failure.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=655.6s	655.6	 Make sure it's got room to breathe in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=658.2s	658.2	 That should be very interesting, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=660.9s	660.9	 And one of the whole points of building a campfire, at least in this day and age, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=665.8s	665.8	 to be able to throw that big log on there and know that it's going to burn and know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=670.0s	670.0	 that it's going to do exactly what you want it to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=672.6s	672.6	 But you can never take your attention completely off of the fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=675.4s	675.4	 It always requires some kind of maintenance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=677.6s	677.6	 This is the log I have chosen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=679.5s	679.5	 It has bark on it, generally makes it a little tougher to burn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=683.1s	683.1	 But if the fire is strong enough, it might take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=686.3s	686.3	 Hopefully this will work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=690.3s	690.3	 Good luck log.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=691.3s	691.3	 Now that the fire is big and roaring, you're seeing these logs burn with ease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=696.1s	696.1	 And I could mess with it a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=697.6s	697.6	 I could throw things off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=698.9s	698.9	 But the fire is so strong that it's going to continue to survive at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=703.4s	703.4	 And you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=704.4s	704.4	 A really good fire might even withstand a rainstorm too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=707.8s	707.8	 Well, seems like it's really raining, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=711.6s	711.6	 Zach is persistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=713.4s	713.4	 That's literally raining right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=716.0s	716.0	 And our fire is still surviving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=718.2s	718.2	 The unexpected happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=719.5s	719.5	 Sometimes you get a fire and circumstances are different than you thought they would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=724.1s	724.1	 be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=725.1s	725.1	 What do you do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=726.1s	726.1	 Well, we manage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=727.1s	727.1	 I'm going to continue stirring this fire and provided I'm diligent enough, we can survive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=732.1s	732.1	 even a moderate rain shower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=733.9s	733.9	 I think we got a shot, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=735.9s	735.9	 I don't know about you guys, but sitting here in the rain in Montana next to my fire is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=741.6s	741.6	 so deeply satisfying for some reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=744.0s	744.0	 I don't even want to go inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=745.6s	745.6	 Roofs are overrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=746.6s	746.6	 Rain is definitely picking up now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=749.7s	749.7	 Nature is giving me its best shot right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=753.9s	753.9	 Come on, fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=754.9s	754.9	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=755.9s	755.9	 Pretty sure this is exactly what it was like to be Lewis and Clark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=760.6s	760.6	 By starting off right, not taking too many shortcuts there, we built a strong foundation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=765.3s	765.3	 hopefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=766.3s	766.3	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=768.3s	768.3	 And hopefully that will get us through these kinds of storms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=771.5s	771.5	 Can you be quiet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=772.5s	772.5	 There's a bison over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=773.5s	773.5	 I want you to be quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=774.5s	774.5	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=775.5s	775.5	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=776.5s	776.5	 That's a bison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=777.5s	777.5	 Yeah, so that's real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=778.5s	778.5	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=779.5s	779.5	 And suddenly I started to see new life in my fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=786.4s	786.4	 The rain was still continuing, but my fire burned anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=791.1s	791.1	 I'm really into this metaphor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=792.5s	792.5	 Each layer feeds the next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=794.7s	794.7	 And when you combine everything and total it out, you have such an amazing fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=800.0s	800.0	 Well, I just want to remember this campsite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=802.9s	802.9	 So I'm going to take video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=805.4s	805.4	 This is where I learned the ways of nature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=807.8s	807.8	 This is where I learned how to be self-sufficient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=811.1s	811.1	 I no longer need the conveniences of modern technology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=814.9s	814.9	 I have everything I need right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=817.0s	817.0	 I wonder if there's a McDonald's nearby because I am hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=820.2s	820.2	 How you doing, girl?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=822.6s	822.6	 She's enjoying herself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=823.9s	823.9	 I don't know that Inersha has ever seen a campfire and how sad is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=828.1s	828.1	 She really seems to be taking to it though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=830.1s	830.1	 She's mesmerized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voR-MZXRXmc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=831.1s	831.1	 Clearly, Inersha's fire is roaring, but Veronica is still just starting to spark.
