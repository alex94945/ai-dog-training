https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=25.5s	25.5	 This is Inertia. Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 Today I want to work with Inertia on her off-leash training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 Priority one is to make sure that she is not hangry for this training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 Have you guys seen this? Nom Nom is changing everything.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 I love not having to think when I feed my dog and still know that she's getting super healthy meals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=67.5s	67.5	 Nom Nom's meals are made with USDA restaurant grade ingredients.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 We are enjoying sharing Inertia's journey with all of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 And as we move forward, we're having a stronger and stronger emphasis on off-leash training with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 Let's go over how to get a dog to behave and listen to you while off-leash in completely uncontrolled environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 Teaching most dogs to listen to you off-leash reliably in a variety of places takes a good couple of years of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 You'll remember that we've been and still do use the long lead extensively to aid us in our off-leash training endeavors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 Ideally, we use a long lead like this at first to allow our dogs to know what it's like to be farther and farther away from us in some situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 The lead allows us to somewhat simulate off-leash training while also giving us control of the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=129.5s	129.5	 Should things not go as we expect them to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=132.5s	132.5	 So frequently when I'm training in places like parks or other places in public, I like to use a long lead like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 Once I feel that a dog is fairly reliable while on a long lead and I've tested them over a few months and lots of places, I then graduate to training in fenced areas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=148.5s	148.5	 And as counterintuitive as it seems, I still use the long lead even in a fenced area, but I'm using the lead in a different way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 See, I really want to freely be able to drop the lead while testing our training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 So in the event there is a breakdown in our communication, I'm able to more quickly get to a 50-foot lead in order to regain control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 And I should remind you that you should seek out new and unfamiliar but fenced environments very often throughout the first couple of years of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 Maybe a family member has a large fenced yard or you drive an extra 20 minutes or so to go to a different fenced sports field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=181.5s	181.5	 Dogs don't always know whether a specific patch of real estate is fenced or not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 so you can get a taste of how they might respond when in a new place and off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 So let's say that you are at the point where your dog is listening to you extremely reliably with the lead on and in a fenced environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 That's when you can start testing without the lead. And this process can go on for months in different places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 And if at any point throughout this training, your dog starts to not listen to basic requests like come and stay, take a step back, put that lead back on them and polish up that training a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 It's been completely normal for inertia and I to have some good days and some not so good days when doing off-leash training over the last one plus years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 So where are we in our journey today? We're about to find out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 We're going to do some off-leash training today. And you might notice right off the bat, we're not in a big city.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 And you can see there's not a lot of dogs. There's not a lot of people around at all right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 So when you're training your dog to listen to you off leash, you want to change one variable at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 In this case, the variable we're changing is, well, essentially removing the fence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 So let's make sure we have some basic control of inertia. I'm going to be using her frisbee as currency today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 Go on. There we go. Got to get her in the mood to play good where possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 I like to start my off-leash training sessions with a game of fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 I like to get her warmed up before a training session. But frisbee and fetch in and of itself is off-leash training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 In fact, for us, it's been a really important part of off-leash training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 And she's intrigued by these people who are coming up over here. She notices them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 Come on. Inertia. Good girl. Good here. Get it. Get it. That was a good decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 Come around. Good. Looking at him again, but coming right back this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 Look how eagerly she's running back towards me. That's a huge part of off-leash training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 You want to make sure that your dog will come to you. And if you've gotten them obsessed with fetch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=300.0s	300.0	 if you happen to have that kind of dog anyway, then you're getting them enthusiastic about running towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 And I don't care if my dog has a toy or not. They're sprinting towards me. I'm happy. Heel. Look at me. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 Good. Lie down. Stay. Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 Stand. Look at me. Heel. This way. Easy. Look at me. Stay. Heel. Come on. Heel. Come on. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=344.0s	344.0	 Here. Come on. Come on. Oh, this way. Switch. Come on. Let's go. Lie down. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 Stand. Stay. Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 Stay. Okay. Get it. Come on. Let go. Good. Go. Good job. Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 So in addition to basic obedience like that, you know, I like to do fun tricks too. Come on. Weave. Keep going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=394.0s	394.0	 Good. Lie down and roll over. Come around. Go. Stand. Stay. Yes. Heel. Circles. Keep going. Yes. Come around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=413.0s	413.0	 That was a different direction than normal too. Do you remember a crawl? Keep going. Keep going. Yes. Come around. Go. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=422.0s	422.0	 Good. Stay. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=430.0s	430.0	 Okay. This might look super silly, but even practicing something like play dead where you want your dog to hold that position and throwing in some extra distractions can really translate into other areas of training and teach them great impulse control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=444.0s	444.0	 Okay. Come around. Good. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=448.0s	448.0	 A hugely important part of your training with off-leash training is to make sure that your dog has a very reliable stay and come when called. So that's something we really are putting a strong emphasis on. Girl, come. Heel. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=462.0s	462.0	 She didn't know I was going to do that. We hadn't practiced that where I started going up the hill. So that threw her off. I need to fix that right now. So let me break that down. This is important. I pushed her too far. So I need to make it easier for her. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 Stay. I'm going to pause here to reiterate. So I think that's all I need to do with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=503.0s	503.0	 Ah, stay. Come. Good. Lie down. Good. Come this way. No. Come. There we go. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=519.0s	519.0	 And she's like, Hey, what about this? Let go. I think that's a good deal. Girl. Nice. Let's see how inertia is doing with a basic off leash free walk. Now free walk is just where you let your dog roam and sniff and be a dog. But the only real rule is that she stays with me and doesn't reach the end of this leash. I'll periodically be making sure that she comes back. I'll change directions just to keep her paying attention. But this has its own set of challenges in that as you move, you're being consistently in the same direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=549.0s	549.0	 I've been constantly introduced to new ground sense and new variables. And one of inertia's favorite things in life is to just sniff and smell and enjoy the world. She really finds great satisfaction in it. So we'll see how she's doing in here. I mean, if she wants to stay near me, she can. If she wants to roam ahead, she can. And I still have her on the long lead, just again, to be extra responsible and make sure that if any surprises occur, I have options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=577.0s	577.0	 I'm going to call her back the other way just to make sure she's paying attention. Inertia, come. So I'll just start walking this way. That looks pretty good. We're just using the environment as a reward right now, letting her continue on her way and sniff the ground. Inertia, come. Wanted to keep up with me here. That's very good. Don't want to getting too far away. The whole idea of a walk like this is to keep your dog engaged. But look, she's getting a little far away here, almost getting to the end of the leash. Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=607.0s	607.0	 Here. Come on. Good girl. Lie down. Good girl. Yes. Stay. And this whole time, I haven't given her any food rewards or frisbee. I am using the environment here. And at this point, I expect her to listen to basic requests like this, even when I don't have treats, because we've been phasing them out. Doesn't mean I'll never use treats, but I don't have to. And here, I mean, she has given me enough confidence where I feel I can let her drag the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=637.0s	637.0	 I don't have to necessarily hold it, but you'd want to make sure you're really confident that your dog was pretty reliable before you let go of the lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=649.0s	649.0	 Come. Good girl. Here. Yes. I'm going to use a treat there. So if she's having a particularly tough time listening to me, then I'll break out a treat here and there. But it's just more and more rare these days that I have to do that. And that's kind of how it goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=666.0s	666.0	 Your dog doesn't just go from not trained to train. There's this whole bit of stuff in between that you have to work through. So between the occasional high value reward like chicken or something like that, or a toss of the frisbee and allowing her to explore the environment, that's usually enough to gain compliance from her. Inertia. Come. Come on. Come on. Good girl. Yes. Here we go. I'll give her a good reward there too. I'll create some distance to make this easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=696.0s	696.0	 Easy for her inertia. Come. Good girl. Come on. He'll lie down. Stay. Very good. Yes. Stay. So I'm going to pause here. I'm going to put her into a down stay. You can see we got a heck of a distraction here. Dog playing fetch here. Yes. Good girl. So I'm going to let her look at me. Now look at the dog here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=720.0s	720.0	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=725.0s	725.0	 Girl here. Yes. So they're really good job holding her stay while watching a dog running and playing for her. That's been quite the challenge. So no reaction. Now the puppy is getting farther away. Come on. Let's go. Good. Lie down. Good. Come around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HeJvQeJi04&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=229&pp=iAQB&t=747.0s	747.0	 Good. Come. And I'll tell you what, let's see. I have a good feeling here. Let's take the lead off completely here for a sec. Come around. Ready? Go. Good. Come. Good. And so now being able to play frisbee with a dog in the distance. So she was very focused through all that. Now I'm back to off leash training on a slightly different path.
