https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49A12LPsE8M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=613&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 The traditional advice on this is when your dog jumps on you, you cross your arms and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49A12LPsE8M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=613&pp=iAQB&t=161.8s	161.8	 you turn around.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49A12LPsE8M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=613&pp=iAQB&t=173.1s	173.1	 You've got to do this in your own individual way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49A12LPsE8M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=613&pp=iAQB&t=175.4s	175.4	 Look into your dog's eyes often when you're training them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49A12LPsE8M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=613&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 Her eyes will get all wide and she'll say, I'm about to jump.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49A12LPsE8M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=613&pp=iAQB&t=189.5s	189.5	 Use treats in the beginning.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49A12LPsE8M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=613&pp=iAQB&t=200.3s	200.3	 My goal here is to just try and touch her on the head without her jumping.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49A12LPsE8M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=613&pp=iAQB&t=222.7s	222.7	 No, no, no, no.
