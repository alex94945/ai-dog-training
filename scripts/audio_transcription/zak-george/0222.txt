https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Why you gotta cause a scene when there's a police car right there? I mean come on Kona, be cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 I'm Zach George. I'm a dog trainer. Meet my new project, Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 I've got just three weeks to train her and set her up for the most well-behaved life possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 That means I need to work on the most common puppy issues like potty training, how to actually pay attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 stopping things like play biting, chewing, separation anxiety, getting along with other animals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 leash walking and teaching her everything a good dog needs to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 Real dog training doesn't always go smoothly and that's why I'm going to show you every success and mistake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 and how I work through all the most challenging parts of raising a new puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 Welcome to your new puppy survival guide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 My time with Kona is running out. I can't believe how fast things go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 But there's still some very important things I want to make progress on with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 So I want to do some more training in public to see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 One of the first things I like to do with Kona in the morning, you know, after I let her out for her first potty break,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 after she's had a little bit of playtime, is to do some very light training for her breakfast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 just to kind of get her warmed up and primed for the day of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 Kona loves her breakfast. In fact, I don't know that I've ever seen a puppy that likes to eat as much as her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 When Kona first started staying with us, she was an excessive jumper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 You saw a little bit of it there. It's still there a little bit, but you can see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 I love this dog. Boy, it's great when your training actually works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 Because remember, she wasn't even conditioned to the crate when we first got her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 So I love seeing that. Feeding your dog in their crate is a must if you're trying to get them comfortable with being in their crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 Have you ever seen a puppy inhale food like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Finding a food that your dog loves eating is always a plus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 I like to give her this right after her breakfast as well. These are sea meal soft chews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 These aren't just like treats. These are super nutrient dense supplements for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 The first ingredient is dried seaweed meal, which we all know is good for us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 If you start off by feeding your puppy a really premium food while they're growing the most,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 it could make a huge difference as they get older.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 Just for our viewers, you can get 30% off of select solid gold products by going to solidgoldpet.com slash Zach.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 We're going to go find a place to train as we're walking to there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 She's going to get a lot of time to adjust to yet another dramatically different setting than she's used to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 We're here in downtown New Orleans today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 This is a place that I love to train dogs because of all the distractions and the fact that it's a nice urban setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 So for Kona, this could be a total curve ball for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 It could be really challenging for her to focus or she may continue to impress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 We'll just have to see. Kona, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 There we go. So far, so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 I'm not even training yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 One thing that's immediately different about training here, I've got to keep this leash really short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 I mean, we've got cars all over the place, so I don't want to let her wander too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 And that restriction that I have to keep her on right here might make her a little uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 I want to be cognizant of that because if she feels like she's having to pull to get everywhere, it might not put her in the right mindset for this training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 But safety is, of course, the number one priority.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 So I'll try and balance those two things as we go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 We have a little city bird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 When you're filming out here, you don't know when a bird is going to cross your path or a dog is going to come around the corner or any of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 So I'm just stopping right here because I feel like I just want her to stop and look around rather than continuing the walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 Let's see if I can encourage her to move along on the walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 Hey, Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 Yes, let's go. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 See that? Do you see how she had to think through her actions there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 There was no manipulating her with the leash at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 It's natural to want to physically control your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 There's nothing even inhumane about that necessarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 They're just not really experiencing originating a particular behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 And there are endless training opportunities when you're in a new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 I mean, here we have some broken glass that we have to watch out for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 I want to be preemptive because I don't want to mess around with her accidentally getting a piece of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 Look at me. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 Look at me. Let's go. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 Yes. Just wanted to be extra careful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 There we go. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 So there we go. Don't give your puppy too much of a benefit of the doubt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 I really want to improve Kona's heel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 She's shown so much potential at such a young age for this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 and she has been so adaptable thus far in various environments that if we could get her walking nicely on leash out here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 that would be a huge plus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=251.0s	251.0	 Let me pick up where we left off yesterday and just kind of remind her what this whole exercise is about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 Easy. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 I have to kind of remind her of easy. We just introduced that concept yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 If your puppy takes treats really rough, watch the last episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 What's this? Look at me. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 Since I'm in public here, I really want to make this heel training exercise as easy as I can for her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 even if that means giving her tiny bits of the treat that I'm holding every half step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 After all, she's a young puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 Obviously today, this is still very lured dependent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 This is a brand new behavior, but maybe by the end of this lesson,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 I can get a few examples of her healing without having to have a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=288.0s	288.0	 So obviously in front of her, since she does follow this lore so well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 I'm really trying to refine that spin into heel position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 She's really doing well on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 And of course, it takes a little bit of time to phase out the lure on this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=300.0s	300.0	 But my objective with doing this right now is just to get that muscle memory intact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=304.0s	304.0	 Dogs have to learn how to use all four of their legs in distinct ways moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=308.0s	308.0	 When your dog is healing, you want them paying strict attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 Do keep in mind though, heel is not how you would walk her on a regular basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 It's just a more disciplined form of walking, which is important in urban environments like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=320.0s	320.0	 But sometimes you just have to let your dog be a dog and take a normal walk without healing too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 In fact, most of the time you should do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 Kona. Here. Yeah. What? What are you even doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=333.0s	333.0	 Yes. Come here. Back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=336.0s	336.0	 She's getting a little ahead of me there, but I still like that she's slowing down her pace and looking up at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=341.0s	341.0	 Not asking for perfection here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 Just trying to slowly evolve this behavior. Let's go. What's going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=349.0s	349.0	 Yes. Loving that. See how she does on the left here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 I'm just trying to get Kona really enthusiastic about paying attention to me in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 I'm not looking for a super strict heel as much as I'm just looking for her to seem like she's joyfully engaging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 Joyfully engaging with me. Yes. Good girl. There we go. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=367.0s	367.0	 Getting her warmed up with the mechanics and trying to remind her where we left off was helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=371.0s	371.0	 And then getting a little peppier seemed to really get her more interested in me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 So maybe that's my sign to be more interesting to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 Do you like this? Are you having a good time? Come, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 Look at me here. Kona. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 Okay. Good job. So there we go. Not bad. I like her little prance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=394.0s	394.0	 She's coming to life there. You might have noticed in that last example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 I didn't use any treats to lure her because I think she's starting to get the picture so I can get her to pay attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=404.0s	404.0	 Reinforce after she does what I want her to do. I mean, that's what I'm trying to see anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=408.0s	408.0	 This is the very first step in phasing out treats over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=413.0s	413.0	 Back here. Getting a little in front. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 Good. Keep going. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 This way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=428.0s	428.0	 Back here. Look at that. She's really starting to follow that hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=434.0s	434.0	 Yeah. Oh, look at the sit. I like that. Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 Okay. Take a break. Good girl. I want to go down the street over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 I'm not going to insist that she does a heel like we were just practicing right there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=447.0s	447.0	 but I just want her to kind of stay in my general area. Let her have a leisure walk herself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=452.0s	452.0	 She's smelling something here. Look at that. Calling dogs off-ground sense can be tough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=458.0s	458.0	 Kona, come. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=463.0s	463.0	 Definitely reinforce that when you get it. You can see how training a dog requires you to be overwhelmingly consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=471.0s	471.0	 But the good news is, is if you can master being very consistent going through these steps,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=476.0s	476.0	 your dog will learn at light speed. But if you just lack like 15 or 20 percent consistency,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=482.0s	482.0	 that can set you back for months, if not longer. So you really do just want to commit and follow through,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=487.0s	487.0	 and your dog will learn to do anything you want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=491.0s	491.0	 Every once in a while, Kona sees something that really piques her interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=494.0s	494.0	 When she'll let out a little bit of a bark, all of that's fine. I mean, we're not seeing any outbursts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=499.0s	499.0	 And by letting her investigate things and make sense of them, she's likely to adjust much more quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=505.0s	505.0	 So that heel training session was just a few minutes. It wasn't very long at all,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 because at this age, we're really trying to balance socializing to the world and our basic training at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=514.0s	514.0	 Let's see how her stay with distance is doing. That's an important one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=520.0s	520.0	 I swear she understands every word I'm saying. Kona, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=525.0s	525.0	 Sit. Stay. You can lie down if you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=533.0s	533.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=538.0s	538.0	 OK. Good girl. Yes. Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=542.0s	542.0	 I noticed a couple of yawns there. I mean, you know, they happened right after I gave her a request.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=547.0s	547.0	 So she might be a little frustrated. I'm not sure about that. I'm going to test again just to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=552.0s	552.0	 But that's my cue to lighten up a little bit on her, maybe. You know, that's what we have to look for with our puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=558.0s	558.0	 Remember signs that a dog is getting frustrated or excessive yawning, excessive lip licking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=563.0s	563.0	 scratching or even biting at your clothes a little more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=567.0s	567.0	 Stay. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=572.0s	572.0	 Look at me. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=579.0s	579.0	 So you see, she's having a tougher time here, and that's because we hear different things in the background.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=584.0s	584.0	 There's a big bus going by. I'm going to give her a second and then we'll try to pick up with stay with distance after she's had a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=591.0s	591.0	 I mean, really finding the tempo of a training session. It's all part of the discovery process with a new dog like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=596.0s	596.0	 Yes, I actually like the automatic sit there. And remember, part of the challenge of this particular training session is we've just arrived here seconds ago and we jumped right into training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=606.0s	606.0	 I wanted to see if I could get her to respond to me. We were over there. She was well adjusted. Here she's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=612.0s	612.0	 So the difference of just half a block is huge. Look at me. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=617.0s	617.0	 So I'm going to look for really easy things to reward her on. Like, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=622.0s	622.0	 Okay. Yes. Good work, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=627.0s	627.0	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=630.0s	630.0	 Give her some solid gold kibbles there. So in a way, I'm kind of waiting for her to initiate this training session when she feels comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=635.0s	635.0	 I'm waiting for those signs from her that she's like, Hey, let's play that game where I do stuff and you give me treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=643.0s	643.0	 Yes, that's not a bad thing to do with your own dog. I mean, a real part of training a dog is just waiting for them to be in the right mood and to offer the behaviors organically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=652.0s	652.0	 Yes. Rather than requesting them, make them think it's their idea, right? And you'll find that by doing this over time, your dog is going to be much more in tune with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=657.0s	657.0	 Yes. I like that she's relaxed. That's kind of an organic stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=662.0s	662.0	 So let me see if I can say stay. She's been really good about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=667.0s	667.0	 Okay, come. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=672.0s	672.0	 Good girl. We're going to do a surprise primary training session here in a second. I noticed there was a bottle cap back there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=677.0s	677.0	 I picked it up and I'm going to toss this in front of her and ask her to stay with very, very gentle, gentle movements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=682.0s	682.0	 Teaching a dog to respond to you on something like stay or come when called on very short notice is essential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=687.0s	687.0	 We don't want to wait until a real life situation happens where we suddenly have to ask them to stay or come to us while they're in a surprise state of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=692.0s	692.0	 Koda, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=697.0s	697.0	 Look at me. Yes. Okay. Come on this way. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=702.0s	702.0	 So she had no notice right there at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=707.0s	707.0	 That that was that bottle cap was going to come in front of her and make that dingy sound. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=712.0s	712.0	 That was a really good instance right there where we really had the element of surprise and she succeeded pretty flawlessly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=717.0s	717.0	 I want to try that drill again, but of course the element of surprise isn't quite as good here, but I'm going to make it a little more exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=722.0s	722.0	 Who is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=727.0s	727.0	 So here you can see she's barking at someone. Look at me. Yes. There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=733.0s	733.0	 I was able to get her attention off of the police vehicle there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=738.0s	738.0	 Why you got to cause a scene when there's a police car right there? I mean, come on, Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=743.0s	743.0	 Nonchalant, man. Be cool. Look at me. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=748.0s	748.0	 Look at me. Yeah, that was huge. You guys, she's doing so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=753.0s	753.0	 Look at me. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=758.0s	758.0	 Look at me. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=763.0s	763.0	 Let's try some food. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=768.0s	768.0	 Look at me. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=773.0s	773.0	 So, I mean, okay, good girl. Leave it. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=778.0s	778.0	 Good girl. Come on. Let's go this way. I mean, that was really impressive. You can see how Kona's impulse control is really starting to go next level right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=787.0s	787.0	 New environment, being surprised, listening on short notice like that. 14 weeks old. What a star student she is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=793.0s	793.0	 You can see how we are connecting all of the dots in these lessons here. She's doing well with sit down, stay, look at me, come, leash walking, paying attention at will, leaving things alone when we ask her to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=805.0s	805.0	 I mean, there's a lot going on here more than just leash walking. You can see at this point we're not focusing on one thing at a time necessarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=812.0s	812.0	 We're really combining a lot of those skills into a single experience for Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=817.0s	817.0	 Here we have the obligatory garbage truck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=821.0s	821.0	 Garbage trucks can throw many dogs off. So I love this training situation right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=828.0s	828.0	 Nice job, girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=834.0s	834.0	 Now, you know, if she weren't, we would do some basic desensitizing and counter conditioning with her. I've had to do a lot of that with my own dog, Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=843.0s	843.0	 I mean, every dog is different. Some dogs are more naturally prone to be reactive towards things like that. Others are more dialed back like Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=851.0s	851.0	 What's this? Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=855.0s	855.0	 Stay. Yes. Yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=863.0s	863.0	 Another garbage truck. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=867.0s	867.0	 I think we could be street performers in New Orleans. No problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=871.0s	871.0	 I mean, it's a good fallback option if this whole YouTube thing doesn't work out. You'll have to know how to take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=878.0s	878.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=881.0s	881.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=883.0s	883.0	 Okay, good. I've had kind of a tough time getting that lure away where she'll hold it because she wants to get up almost immediately when I pull it away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=891.0s	891.0	 But sometimes you can see how it's really splitting hairs at the beginning of this particular training session, again, in a distracting environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=898.0s	898.0	 So I need to take that into account, too. It's a little bit harder just by virtue of being in an outdoor new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=902.0s	902.0	 I was having to really just constantly reward to keep her in that position with the aim of trying to get my hand to pause out here to eventually phase it into a hand signal, which would be, you know, take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=913.0s	913.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=915.0s	915.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=916.0s	916.0	 I was able to get a small victory. I was able to get her to hold that bow position for just a fraction of a second longer, which is progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=924.0s	924.0	 And that principle applies to so many things, whether it's heel, what we're trying to keep them in a specific position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=929.0s	929.0	 And you'll know from past videos, even though it looks like I'm rewarding her a lot. In this case, I was using chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=934.0s	934.0	 Remember, I'm just feeding little tiny micro bits through my fingers as she holds the position. So it is a small amount, just to be clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=942.0s	942.0	 Okay, good girl. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=944.0s	944.0	 So we've got hug. We've got bow. Let's see how shake is doing. Shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=951.0s	951.0	 Can I have your paw?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=955.0s	955.0	 Yes. Okay, I'll take it. Shake might need a little work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=960.0s	960.0	 You can see on this 10 foot lead right now, she's starting to get a little away from me. So I'm going to proof come when called on short notice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=967.0s	967.0	 Kona, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=969.0s	969.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=971.0s	971.0	 Good. Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=973.0s	973.0	 There's a scent right through the bushes here. It's got her attention, but she did come to me. So I want to let her know I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=980.0s	980.0	 Kona, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=985.0s	985.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=987.0s	987.0	 Good girl. And I'm just kind of luring her into that heel position loosely just to, again, have a slow, steady effort to work on that muscle memory. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=996.0s	996.0	 Kona, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=997.0s	997.0	 Look at this. This is her first elevator. Come on, girl. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1001.0s	1001.0	 Good job. Come on. Good work. Isn't that neat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1006.0s	1006.0	 It'll be interesting to see how she responds to the movement of the elevator here as we go up. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1015.0s	1015.0	 Listen to that buzz that vibrating floor. You know, it's a loud elevator. That's a wonderful socialization experience for a young dog like this. And she's classic Kona right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1031.0s	1031.0	 Yes. I even like that she's offering me her attention in this new situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1036.0s	1036.0	 Okay. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1040.0s	1040.0	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1042.0s	1042.0	 See right there. I had to use force because I failed to control the environment and keep aware. I mean, we can't be perfect. So I'm not saying that you never use force when you're training a dog. It's just the least ideal option because if I was paying attention, I could have practiced a real life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1055.0s	1055.0	 Leave it. You know, over time, it'll be my duty to set her up for those training exercises like we did before because I hate when I have to do that. Right. That's not ideal. She's not going to learn. That's more of a management technique than it is a training technique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1066.0s	1066.0	 The leash is primary function is a safety net to prevent your dog from going too far doing something you don't want to. But we don't use the leash ideally anyway to physically train our dog. Right. But in that case, I was caught off guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1078.0s	1078.0	 I had to rely on the safety net to keep her away from picking up a potentially harmful item. And so I only bring this up to let you know that yeah, sometimes you do have to have tension on your leash when your dog is going for something. But I also want to differentiate that that that is not really the ideal training strategy in order to teach your dog to originate thoughts from the inside outwards. So real good example right there. It happens to all of us. Look at this fountain right here. This is another unique socialization experience. Let's let her look at that. You can see it's got her attention a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1108.0s	1108.0	 Can't be more distracting than a cat to hurricane. Can it? She's interested. You want to try paws up? Yes. Nice job, girl. Okay. Good job and paws up. Look at that generalizing paws up out here. Cunha's done a lot of training today. I don't think we really need to do much, but it's a good idea to have a little bit of a chat with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1136.0s	1136.0	 So that's it for today. I don't think we really need to do much, but it is worth pointing out that if you can socialize your dog around construction equipment and loud sounds at a distance where they feel comfortable, then you might get a lot of benefit for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1149.0s	1149.0	 Now if your dog was more nervous, you might want to work up to an environment like a construction site. But for a dog like Cunha, this can only further her progress and condition her to react ideally when encountering places just like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1161.0s	1161.0	 We're actually required to walk through a construction zone. That's how we get to where we're going. We've got some construction workers to pass over here. Good. Leave it alone. Good girl. Yes. That was wonderful. Real life. Leave it in action there. That was awesome. Huh? That's essentially a surprise training drill right there that we got. And I was ready to snap into training mode, but she reacted how I wanted her to. So I was so thrilled with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1186.0s	1186.0	 We can't go into the casino until you're a little bit older, Cunha. She's got something here. Leave it. Cunha, look at me. Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1195.0s	1195.0	 There's a good example of where she got fixated. I covered the scent up with my foot, got her attention on me. I'm gonna have to do it again here, and then asked her to voluntarily, come on, let's go. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1207.0s	1207.0	 Again, resisting the urge to just yank her along and say, come on, let's go. You know, I mean, you'll find if you can just be patient and take your time doing that kind of training, your dog will really understand it at a much deeper level, much more quickly. Honestly, we made an amazing discovery the other day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1226.0s	1226.0	 She noticed that on the Kindle app in a book, you can actually see some of the top highlighted points that actual readers highlighted. And then it occurred to us, well, I've got a book, right? I wonder what people are highlighting and what they are finding most helpful about my first book, Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1242.0s	1242.0	 I swear, this is not a commercial or promotion for my book. I just want to genuinely cover what you guys think are the most important things. For the next year, I strongly recommend insisting that your dog hold a sit-stay for five to 10 seconds at every open door leading to the outside before allowing them to walk through it. Be really consistent. This is a biggie. I love that that's highlighted because teaching a dog to stay at an open doorway is a potentially life-saving skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1267.0s	1267.0	 You'll recall that was one of the major things that I wanted to accomplish with Kona during this series was really showing her how to stay when there were really exciting things going on outside. So I would throw a toy, I would distract her with treats. In other words, I really want a dog to understand that staying when they want to go is something that we as people strongly value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1286.0s	1286.0	 Here's another one. When I have a new dog, my protocol is to attach a four to six foot leash to my belt loop during the day so that when I get up to go to the kitchen, check the mail or do yard work, my dog is with me. I'm just saying, I do practice what I preach. That's also a good one. Being able to manage your dog's environment. That's everything. Reason being, if your dog is with you all the time, then you're in a position to prevent bad habits from occurring. And you're also in a position to reward good skills that you wish to see repeated too. So attach a leash to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1316.0s	1316.0	 I'm going to give you a little bit of a speech to you, especially with a puppy in training. By the way, can we just observe how amazing Kona is doing with her first barge going down the Mississippi River right here? Let's go on to our next quote. For treats during primary training sessions, again, use tiny pieces of real chicken or other real meat. The reward should be very small, the size of a grain of rice for small dogs and no larger than a pea for medium to large dogs. So today I've been using a combination of her kibble solid gold and chicken just to kind of mix things up. But knowing how to pay your dog when they're learning something new,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1346.0s	1346.0	 and knowing which currency to use is huge. Oh, this next one is about fetch. Don't use treats for fetch. It says trying to teach a dog to fetch within minutes of using food is a bad idea. In most cases, as the dog is in food mode and less likely to be grabby with their mouth. The reward for a proper fetch should be the toy or the object. So I think that makes sense. A lot of people are thrown off by that because we use food so much for training obedience. And it kind of slips our mind sometimes that for teaching a dog to play a vigorous game of fetch, we really want them in place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1376.0s	1376.0	 So we have a play mode where they're like, yeah, that's awesome. I want to play tug of war and just be really playful. Food has the effect of getting dogs to be on their best behavior. And it almost makes them behave a little bit more formally subduing the play. But the whole point of fetch is to have a way to really bring that energy to the surface so that you can get them to burn it on demand when you need to, you know, on your terms and schedule. In fact, in our last video, when I was teaching Kona a retrieve, which is different than a fetch, I was using food because I wanted her to be a little bit more dialed back, not so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1406.0s	1406.0	 full. I just wanted to pick an item up and bring it back. But you notice that the second I switched from the toy as the reward to the food as the reward, she got a lot less grabby with the toy. This is the number six most highlighted point in the book. The fastest way to achieve a bond with most dogs is through activities that involve play such as fetch tug of war or even a game of chase in the backyard. As Plato once said, you can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation. That quote has always resonated with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1436.0s	1436.0	 me because it seems so applicable to dogs. It's just the best way to get to know a dog and for a dog to get to know you when you're in a truly authentic, genuine place of play with your dog. It's euphoric for them and you at the same time. I mean, think about how good you feel when your dog is playing tug of war and being all goofy and crazy, or how you feel when they're running after a ball and burning all that energy and vigorously coming back to you. When dogs associate things they love with you, that bond grows. And when that bond grows,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1466.0s	1466.0	 you'll have a dog that does anything. I'm glad you guys highlighted this one here too. This is a super valuable one. Prepare to spend 20 minutes to one hour a day of training and exercise at least five days a week for the first six months to a year of training. I guess that one was highlighted so much because it really highlights the recipe to a trained dog, right? If you put in the time and you're doing the right things during that time, you can expect your dog to behave as most people would wish their dog to behave. Oh, an example is highlighted as our next quote. For example, if you ask your dog to come,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1496.0s	1496.0	 and she doesn't come, then it's up to you to snap into training mode for a few seconds or a few minutes if necessary to motivate her to come to you regardless of what you're busy doing. You gave the request. Now see it through and make sure you get the result you want. I mean, that's true. Follow through is huge. So in the case of getting your dog to come to you, in a worst case, if you're calling them, you're offering them treats, and they're like, no, I don't want to come. Well, you still have to see it through and you have to go up and gently escort them back to the point from where you were calling them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1526.0s	1526.0	 From I mean, especially with something like come when called, it's vital to follow through. I love how you guys are really clued into very specific pieces of advice in the book. Next. Also remember to put away your dog's favorite toys unless you're playing with them. That way your pet will be excited when you bring them out as a reward. If special toys like balls, frisbees and tug toys are just left out all the time, they'll likely lose their potency. With that, I do want to clarify to that that doesn't mean you leave all toys put away. I mean, especially with a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1556.0s	1556.0	 like Kona having various toys of varying textures are important for her to chew on. But it is true things like balls, frisbees, and tug toys, especially I like to use those as currency. So those are usually put out of her reach. Some good potty training advice here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1571.8s	1571.8	 Number two, at the very least walk your dog first thing in the morning right after he wakes up from a nap 10 to 20 minutes after eating and drinking after playtime and right before bedtime. Not much to say about that. Let your dog out very often if you're trying to potty train a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1586.4s	1586.4	 This next quote is kind of related to the last one here. Dogs will typically have to go potty about 15 to 20 minutes after eating and also make sure you remove your dog's water dish two hours before bedtime and during house training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnv2Mw5yW6c&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=223&pp=iAQB&t=1597.3s	1597.3	 Potty training a puppy is one of those things that require so much follow through. You have to really be committed for that first year of training of not getting too complacent just because you go a couple of days without an accident.
