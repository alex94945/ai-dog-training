https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I just want to show you guys this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=1.6s	1.6	 Donnie is my foster dog, and one thing that I think is going to be really important for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 whoever adopts him is that he participates in some kind of dog sport.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=9.1s	9.1	 He has a lot of energy and he needs a productive outlet, so why not frisbee?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=13.5s	13.5	 It's local and it's super simple and not very intimidating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=16.8s	16.8	 I really love how easy this sport is to get into for people that haven't done dog sports
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=22.5s	22.5	 So, for the next two weeks, we're going to be working on getting Donnie ready for frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=27.2s	27.2	 I'd like to have him catching frisbees out of the air by then, but to participate in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=30.9s	30.9	 the sport, he can still catch rollers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=32.6s	32.6	 That's perfectly fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 I am just particularly bad at throwing them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=35.8s	35.8	 But my main priority is going to be seeing if he can do this around other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=41.6s	41.6	 That could be very challenging for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=43.9s	43.9	 Our other big training goal between now and then is teaching him how to let go of the frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 I love playing frisbee with dogs, and I love the variety of reasons people get into teaching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=54.4s	54.4	 their dogs how to play frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tryRvfaEHug&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 Tell me what you guys think, and once again, awesome job, Tara and Donnie.
