https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today's video is sponsored by PepFlo. One of the best ways to get your dog interacting with you is to get them playing with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=7.9s	7.9	 Today Stella, the four-month-old Italian Greyhound puppy and I are going to show you what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 You're kind of funny looking, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=14.2s	14.2	 Click thumbs up for Stella, make sure you're subscribed to my channel, and pick up a copy of my book, Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=19.4s	19.4	 I've been enjoying sharing with you guys some of my favorite super premium dog foods lately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=23.4s	23.4	 I want to tell you about Open Farm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=25.5s	25.5	 Let's take this formula.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=26.8s	26.8	 Ocean Whitefish Meal, field peas, green lentils.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=29.3s	29.3	 When you see an ingredient list like that, you know that you're feeding your dog something really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 You'll get super premium quality ingredients like wild caught fish, fresh fruits and vegetables from local farms, and meat that's humanely raised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=40.5s	40.5	 All of their recipes are grain free, high in protein, and they avoid using high risk ingredients that are often associated with allergies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 And they've got some unconventional ones like these Codskins too, which are way cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 You can actually trace every single ingredient in your bag of Open Farm back to the source using their What's in Your Bag feature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 Stella is loving the dehydrated chicken treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 If you want to feed your pet-like family, make it easier and order your food from Pet Flow and have it delivered directly to your front door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 I'll have a link and a coupon code in the description that'll get you all set up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 We all know that you can use treats during training, but if you can get your dog playing on cue and bring some structure to that play,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=78.8s	78.8	 you might be surprised at the rapid progress you can achieve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=81.7s	81.7	 But not all dogs immediately like toys or maybe they like one toy, but not another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 Today, we're going to see if we can get Stella interested in playing with different toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 Let's see how Stella reacts to this toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=93.3s	93.3	 You'd be surprised at what a squeaky sound can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 Of course, be cautious when squeaking a toy right in your dog's face for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=99.3s	99.3	 You don't want to scare them. Oh, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=101.3s	101.3	 One way to get your dog really interested in a toy is to bring it to life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=105.2s	105.2	 Make it exciting. Do a little bit of keep away here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 Let them win sometimes. Don't just keep it away from them forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=110.9s	110.9	 If your dog doesn't get this into the toy immediately, it doesn't mean you're doing something wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=114.6s	114.6	 She just happens to really like this particular toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=117.5s	117.5	 Experimentation is a huge part of getting your dog interested in different toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=121.3s	121.3	 There are really two types of toys out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 You have toys like this that are really fun for training and getting your dog to engage with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 Things like tug toys, frisbees, balls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 And then you have toys like bones or other safe chew toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 And it's important that with toys like this, you only break them out when you're directly interacting with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 Safe chew toys, however, they can chew on those anytime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=141.6s	141.6	 Now, just because Stella likes this toy here doesn't mean she's going to like every toy in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=146.9s	146.9	 I've got an idea. I want to try our next toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=149.2s	149.2	 I don't think it's going to be quite this easy to get her into it, but let's see what we can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 I love a dog that will play frisbee, but a frisbee to most dogs is actually quite boring at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 I mean, it's just a thick piece of plastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 This one's going to take a little bit more work, I suspect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 I'm moving the frisbee around here trying to get it interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 And she's just over there sniffing the door saying, what's over here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=168.3s	168.3	 She's not interested in this frisbee one bit yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=171.1s	171.1	 What's this? What's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 Oh, there we go. Right there. See, she looked at it a little bit more curiously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 I like that. That's where it starts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 She likes it when I move around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=179.7s	179.7	 That's OK. That's cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 So if I could get her interested in me and transfer that to this frisbee, that'd be great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=189.9s	189.9	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=192.8s	192.8	 Stay with me here. I know this seems a little weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 I'm holding a feather. Hey, Stella, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=199.2s	199.2	 See, years ago, when I used to do frisbee dog competitions with my own dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 my dog Supernova, he wasn't particularly interested in frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 So I stumbled on this by accident, noticing that he really loved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 this particular cat toy that had feathers attached to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=213.4s	213.4	 I took those feathers off the cat toy, taped them on the frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=216.8s	216.8	 And the rest is history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 Clearly, this modified toy isn't something you'd want to leave with your dog unsupervised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=221.9s	221.9	 I'm just trying to spark her interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 And I'm trying to think outside the box a little bit just to get her interested in the frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=227.3s	227.3	 So use discretion, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=229.6s	229.6	 Yeah. What is that? Whoa. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 Already immediately more interested. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 Yeah. And she's checking it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 That's already a victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=238.3s	238.3	 You know, just be creative with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=240.2s	240.2	 If your dog doesn't immediately take to a toy, that doesn't mean they hate the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 It might take a couple of training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=245.4s	245.4	 So you can see we're on the right track with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 Now, she's not totally taken to the frisbee in one single training session, but that's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 We saw her lighten up and get fairly interested in it more so than she was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=255.9s	255.9	 And sometimes just small bits of progress are all you really want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=258.9s	258.9	 So I think she's on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 Of course, your dog is going to have some say in what they like and what they don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=266.2s	266.2	 You want the baseball man?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 Oh, look at that. I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=270.9s	270.9	 She loves a tug toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 There's so much you can teach with a tug toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=274.8s	274.8	 Look at that. Get it. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=276.7s	276.7	 It's not like your dog is going to just love most toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=279.6s	279.6	 So it's important to make toys interesting to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=282.3s	282.3	 And so the more you play with your dog with different toys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=284.8s	284.8	 the more you should notice that their interest intensifies over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z0EOHPNfI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=495&pp=iAQB&t=288.0s	288.0	 Check out OpenFarm's amazing line of products at PetFlow.
