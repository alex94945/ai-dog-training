https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today's kind of an unusual day. We're going to be talking to the Association of Professional Dog Trainers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=4.6s	4.6	 Our friend Trevor of Doggie Dojo has given a talk on dog training and social media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=9.6s	9.6	 And we are supposed to be a special guest via video conference, so that should be interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=14.4s	14.4	 But here's the thing. We tried last night and rehearsal was pretty much a disaster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 We couldn't get a reliable feed. We'll see how well it goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=21.2s	21.2	 I'm super excited to talk about it too because I love YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=24.1s	24.1	 I mean, that's my social media of choice, if you will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=27.6s	27.6	 And to be able to talk to other dog trainers about that will be pretty interesting too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 So I'm just sitting over here with all kinds of things hooked up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=35.4s	35.4	 I've got my mic. I've got our audio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=38.3s	38.3	 I've got my one pair of headphones listening to the live stream.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=41.7s	41.7	 My other pair of headphones monitoring audio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=44.8s	44.8	 Hey guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=46.5s	46.5	 All right. Wow. Looks like a bunch of talent there. A lot of great dog trainers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=50.1s	50.1	 My name is Zach and I, my, between my girlfriend and co-producer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=54.5s	54.5	 and I, we produce the world's most watched dog training content on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=58.8s	58.8	 I've been doing this since 2006.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=61.1s	61.1	 I started doing this because I really have a strong desire to show people how to teach their dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=67.1s	67.1	 how to connect with them and really raise the standards in teaching dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=70.5s	70.5	 I mean, that's really why we started doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=72.4s	72.4	 I'm also the author of Dog Training Revolution right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=75.3s	75.3	 And I really recognized immediately that YouTube presented a unique opportunity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=81.1s	81.1	 to really present all sorts of things, not only dog training, all sorts of things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 but I saw that it was a game changer and that it could really make a huge difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=90.6s	90.6	 when the average person could really promote what they wanted to promote and get out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 I mean, I just thought that was an amazing thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=98.1s	98.1	 What YouTube really allows people to do is have that average,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 the average person to get out there and really allow the public to kind of determine what they like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 what they're interested in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=107.7s	107.7	 And it's the democratization of video content that I think is really the game changer with YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=114.1s	114.1	 And you really get to see what the public is interested in, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=118.4s	118.4	 and in this case, wonderfully, and it's so exciting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=122.4s	122.4	 the public is really interested in positive modern dog training methods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=125.7s	125.7	 I think that's kind of what our success on YouTube has shown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 If you think about it, like back in the day, you know, 20 years ago when people would get a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=133.5s	133.5	 they might go to the bookstore, they might try and find a great book on dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=136.7s	136.7	 Maybe they would try to find a DVD or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=139.7s	139.7	 But these days, they're going to the internet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=141.5s	141.5	 They're going to YouTube to really get that guidance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=143.8s	143.8	 They're insisting on better information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=146.3s	146.3	 I think the public is becoming more intelligent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=149.5s	149.5	 I know that's an arguable point, but I think as the internet really presents education to people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 and information to people that allows everyday people, average people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 to make more informed decisions about their dog and other aspects of their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 Being in front of a camera isn't for everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 And there are other ways to really make a splash on social media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 that don't center around being an on-camera personality, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 If you're a great photographer, you can do things like Instagram,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 or if you're a great writer, you can compose wonderful essays on Facebook
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 that really, you know, shine a spotlight on modern methods in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 And there's no vehicle to get things shared better than on Facebook that I know of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 Twitter is another great social network for people to really take advantage of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=190.1s	190.1	 And that's my background on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=192.6s	192.6	 What questions do you have for me, Trevor?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=194.2s	194.2	 I think it's important to be very tolerant when you start out on social media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=197.4s	197.4	 because you're talking to so many different people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=199.9s	199.9	 and you need to understand that there are a lot of different viewpoints out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 And what's one thing I wouldn't do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=205.6s	205.6	 I would try not to act irresponsibly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=208.9s	208.9	 And by that, I mean, I take it really serious, the responsibility very seriously,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=213.3s	213.3	 of making sure that I do my best to advise the public in a responsible way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 since I know that lots of people are watching me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=219.3s	219.3	 So making sure that you're presenting good information, I think, is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=222.5s	222.5	 at least in the area of dog training, is one thing that I would do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 I know as far as my YouTube videos go, I make my videos as long as they need to be and not longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 So that's how I would say, if it takes 25 minutes to conduct a proper lesson, then that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=239.5s	239.5	 If it takes three minutes, that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=241.8s	241.8	 So I think taking into account your viewers' time is important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 I had a great time doing that. Thank you, Trevor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 Thank you, APDT, for having me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=250.1s	250.1	 Hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=250.8s	250.8	 Let's get live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=251.4s	251.4	 I just decided to vlog you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=253.1s	253.1	 You want to see it? Here's what you look like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 Do you like Game of Thrones?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 Good question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 Yes, I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=258.9s	258.9	 Like, that's not typically my kind of TV, but there were zombies in the first episode,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 or white walkers, so I was hooked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=264.6s	264.6	 So if you don't follow us on Instagram, do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 It's Zach George on Instagram. Pretty easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=270.1s	270.1	 Just a bunch of live stuff today. That was fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUpg5AhBPHs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=435&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 Click thumbs up, subscribe to my channel.
