https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=155.3s	155.3	 and their dogs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 Well, there's a lot here I need to talk about because eye contact is the very foundation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=173.7s	173.7	 of the way that I teach dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=176.3s	176.3	 So obviously I think eye contact is very important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=179.5s	179.5	 But you said a couple of things here that I want to kind of address because they raised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=183.3s	183.3	 a bit of a red flag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 You said you had a fearful rescue dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=189.9s	189.9	 So I think encouraging eye contact from a dog that you know very well, as long as you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=193.6s	193.6	 not seeing any obvious signs of distress or major discomfort.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=198.7s	198.7	 You wouldn't want to go up to a dog that you didn't know for the rest of you and encourage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=203.1s	203.1	 strong eye contact without getting better acquainted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 You said it will build her confidence if she knows you're paying attention to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=209.7s	209.7	 That may be the case, but that's not the primary reason we teach a dog to look at us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 We teach a dog to look at us so that we can guide them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=216.2s	216.2	 Remember, dogs are one of the only animals on planet Earth that look to a human being

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=227.2s	227.2	 There's a lot going on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=228.8s	228.8	 That's how I anticipate a dog's next move almost exclusively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=232.9s	232.9	 Eye contact coupled with overall body language, of course, too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=238.4s	238.4	 Make sure your dog is comfortable, keep it a positive experience and don't ask for too

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 your dog to look at you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=254.6s	254.6	 I think it has like, I mean, a 99 point something percent like to dislike ratio.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=267.5s	267.5	 For example, should you really make sure that you go through a doorway before your dog does?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqpJu15YcU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=567&pp=iAQB&t=273.7s	273.7	 Let me give you a bit of background for those of you that don't know.
