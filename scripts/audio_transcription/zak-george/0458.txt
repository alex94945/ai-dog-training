https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 There's a few problems that almost everyone has when they get a new puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=11.2s	11.2	 So let's talk about those today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=12.8s	12.8	 Hey, click thumbs up for Deuce, the chocolate lab puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=15.9s	15.9	 You can't just bite me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=17.1s	17.1	 Subscribe to my channel and pick up a copy of my book too, Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=21.1s	21.1	 If you've got a new puppy, you're definitely gonna need it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 Trust me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=24.3s	24.3	 Puppies can really try your patience sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 And even if you've watched all of my videos and you feel like you know exactly what to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 the amount of time that it takes to resolve some of these issues can really catch many of you off guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=35.8s	35.8	 Let's start with potty training, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=37.6s	37.6	 Of course, a puppy should never be left unsupervised or in an uncontrolled environment for the first many months of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=43.6s	43.6	 Nonetheless, potty accidents can and will occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 Your goal is to minimize those accidents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 See, preventing accidents from occurring should always be Plan A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 It's ideal to give your dog the opportunity to relieve themselves outside every hour or so when you're awake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=59.1s	59.1	 So what do you do when your dog actually does have an accident in the house?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=62.7s	62.7	 Well, if you don't catch them in the act, then nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=64.8s	64.8	 Just do a better job of supervising them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=67.9s	67.9	 So if you do catch them in the act, do your best to interrupt them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 The ideal time to interrupt your dog is right when they squat before anything comes out and get them outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 I know what you're gonna say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=78.9s	78.9	 They do it so fast you don't even see it coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=81.5s	81.5	 Now look, my top recommendation for anyone with a puppy is to have them attach to you with a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=86.9s	86.9	 And honestly, not enough people take my advice on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 But it's really critical during the first many months of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 With a puppy like this, you haven't had time to really build that mutual communication with each other yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 So in lieu of that, you have to be in total control of where they can and can't go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=102.3s	102.3	 If you have your dog attached to you with a leash, you'll get to know their subtle cues and their body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=106.9s	106.9	 And that will make it a lot easier to be able to tell when they're about to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 He's peeing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 Oh, that's so great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=111.7s	111.7	 You did number one and number two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=113.4s	113.4	 That's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 Since dogs are attracted to previous spots where they've had accidents before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 it's extremely important to do a thorough job of cleaning up any accidents with a safe but good pet urine cleaner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=125.2s	125.2	 Odor Cleanze Pet Urine Eliminator is really great because it really gets rid of the smell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 So if you've got a new puppy, you're definitely gonna want this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=132.6s	132.6	 Odor Cleanze is great about breaking the odors down at the source rather than just covering it up, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=137.8s	137.8	 Or diluting it like many other cleaners do out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=140.6s	140.6	 Most importantly, though, it's safe to use around your pets and your family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=144.2s	144.2	 When your pet has an accident, you just blot the accident, dilute it with warm water,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 then pour on the Odor Cleanze and work it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=150.6s	150.6	 Then add a little bit more water to saturate it, blot up the excess, and let it sit for around 15 minutes or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=156.2s	156.2	 Once it's dry, just vacuum it up and you're done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 You can even use it on hard surfaces or even in the washing machine for your pet's bedding, for example, to get all those smells out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=164.3s	164.3	 You can get your Odor Cleanze Pet Urine Eliminator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=166.5s	166.5	 I'll have a link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=168.1s	168.1	 And when you enter code ZACH20, you'll get 20% off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=170.8s	170.8	 Puppy biting can be really overwhelming to deal with, especially if you're not expecting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=175.8s	175.8	 I mean, really? That was right on cue, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=178.2s	178.2	 Here's the thing about puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=179.6s	179.6	 It is not typically resolved in just a few days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=182.3s	182.3	 It often takes several weeks of really being consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=185.4s	185.4	 Puppies bite because this is how they engage the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=187.9s	187.9	 I mean, they don't have hands, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=189.7s	189.7	 And because they're teething.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=191.1s	191.1	 Puppies understandably like to chew and bite when they're teething.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 So let's sum up what to do about puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 Now, number one, since puppy biting is one of the most predictable behaviors out there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=200.3s	200.3	 when you engage your dog, get in the habit of having them sit or lie down for a treat virtually every single time you interact with them before the biting occurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 This will show them how you expect them to behave when you interact with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=213.3s	213.3	 He's in that bitey mood right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 I've got a treat and watch how quickly this will calm him down and get him to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=220.3s	220.3	 Since your dog's likely to bite and you know they are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=222.9s	222.9	 especially if they're vigorous puppy biter like deuces, be one step ahead of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=227.4s	227.4	 Have them sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=228.9s	228.9	 I'm going to have them hold that sit for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=230.9s	230.9	 I'm going to give them a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=232.1s	232.1	 And you'll also notice too that treats tend to really quell a dog's biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=236.9s	236.9	 In other words, dogs use their mouths for two reasons, to grab things and to eat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=241.6s	241.6	 But when they're in eating mode, they don't tend to grab things as hard or vigorously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=245.6s	245.6	 And see what we've done there is we've used the dog's mouth to grab things and to eat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=248.6s	248.6	 And see what we've done there is we've taken his mind off of the biting behavior and more on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=253.3s	253.3	 hey, pay attention to me right here so that I can show you something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=256.5s	256.5	 Do you know a rollover?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 Secondly, show them that biting on a toy is acceptable so that they have some type of outlet for their biting desires.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=264.6s	264.6	 Why is it you can have all the tug toys and chew toys in the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 but for some reason puppies always prefer their leash?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=271.2s	271.2	 These are the real questions that we don't have answers to yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=274.5s	274.5	 So here's the thing. Now, when you first go to do this, see how he's biting on me right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 I mean, he's really on me. It can be difficult to get their attention on a toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=282.4s	282.4	 when they're so fixated on you, your shirt or whatever it is that they're biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 So you have to be extra persistent here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 I'm trying to get his attention on this and look, he's not into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=292.2s	292.2	 I think I've forgotten how to train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 I just want to body slam them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=296.1s	296.1	 Atta luck. Just stay the course here because if you just really take your time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=300.4s	300.4	 understand that dogs are very curious and very interested in interacting with you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 it's not immediately obvious that we want them to go and pay attention to the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=309.8s	309.8	 But we want to make this toy really enticing, really exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 Hey, what's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=314.7s	314.7	 Remember, motion is a great way to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 There it is right there. And that was the spark. So we're not going to let that go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 We're going to keep it going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=322.0s	322.0	 And it's normal to get a few sparks before you get a fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 Making it wiggle. I should patent that move right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=327.9s	327.9	 There's a lot to the wiggle. See that? Good. There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=330.7s	330.7	 And those are the sparks we're trying to get right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=333.2s	333.2	 Just because they show a little interest in get bored doesn't mean that they're not interested in the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=337.3s	337.3	 You have to stay with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=338.9s	338.9	 This happens over a course of weeks with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=341.2s	341.2	 So this is all part of the process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 But getting your dog hooked on a tug toy equals lots of great options later on when it comes to training your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=349.2s	349.2	 That's a good tug for a three month old. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=352.5s	352.5	 A lot of times people make the assumption that it's about getting them into the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=356.1s	356.1	 It's about getting them into you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=357.5s	357.5	 The toy is just a way for you to interact with your dog in a way that's fun for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=362.1s	362.1	 And if your dog is having fun, they're likely to pay attention for a lot longer period of time too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=366.7s	366.7	 Okay, see right there? He got off the toy and he's like, I want to bite you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=369.7s	369.7	 And that's most likely because I was getting boring with the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=372.7s	372.7	 And so that was more exciting to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=374.3s	374.3	 Especially if you're new to working with a really amped up hyper puppy like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=378.1s	378.1	 It doesn't mean your training isn't working if several days go by and you're still not seeing dramatic improvement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=383.9s	383.9	 I have to emphasize that's totally normal even expected with a high energy puppy like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=388.6s	388.6	 The next major issue that many puppy parents will deal with is destructive chewing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=392.5s	392.5	 Now unwanted chewing is most often due to the fact that with a young puppy especially,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 that they're just teething and they need to be able to chew on things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=399.8s	399.8	 If you have an older dog or if your puppy is past the chewing phase,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=403.3s	403.3	 this most likely means they're bored and don't have an appropriate outlet for all that energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=407.7s	407.7	 If your dog is chewing up your belongings, you are not controlling their environment sufficiently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=412.1s	412.1	 You must cut off all access to things you don't want chewed up, particularly while your dog is teething.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=417.7s	417.7	 Make sure your dog has access to lots of chew toys of varying textures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=421.4s	421.4	 That's really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=422.6s	422.6	 If your dog is chewing out of boredom, this most likely means that they're not getting enough exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=427.7s	427.7	 So you'll need to get in the habit of exercising them often,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=430.4s	430.4	 particularly early in the day and just before leaving them for long periods of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=435.2s	435.2	 I'm going to have to have you stop that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=437.1s	437.1	 I'm sorry, but you can't chew on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=439.2s	439.2	 I mean, how is your dog supposed to differentiate between this and a proper chew toy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=443.3s	443.3	 We have to show them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=444.5s	444.5	 So ideally in this case, we would substitute my shoe with something more acceptable to bite on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=450.7s	450.7	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=451.5s	451.5	 And this is having no effect right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=453.5s	453.5	 So using a treat to get their attention off of the thing will help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=457.2s	457.2	 I'm going to redirect him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=461.2s	461.2	 with the treat over here and I'm going to get his attention off of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=463.5s	463.5	 I'm going to ask him to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=465.8s	465.8	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=466.5s	466.5	 You can't just do this once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=467.5s	467.5	 You'll have to do this hundreds of times over the course of your puppy's puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=471.5s	471.5	 Don't forget to pick up your odor cleanse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=473.3s	473.3	 If you've got a new dog, check the description for a special link and enter code Zach20 when you check out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTg4rb-Nzw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=459&pp=iAQB&t=486.8s	486.8	 See my playlist on how to teach your puppy everything in order as well as more detailed lessons of what we covered today.
