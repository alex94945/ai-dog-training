https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=30.2s	30.2	 In a recent video, you guys told me that you wanted to learn how to teach your dog to listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=33.5s	33.5	 to you while you're farther away from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=35.9s	35.9	 You may have noticed that your dog is much more likely to listen to you when you're up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=39.1s	39.1	 close to them, but when you get just a few feet away, they seem oblivious to any requests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=43.7s	43.7	 you may ask of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=45.1s	45.1	 This is where you're really going to see your efforts start to blossom if you prioritize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 communication with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=50.9s	50.9	 You can't teach something like this with a choke chain or traditional dog training focused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 on dominating your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=56.5s	56.5	 This is all about authentic, real communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=59.7s	59.7	 Dogs are very aware of our body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 They become very accustomed to seeing us work with them in specific positions and any change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 to that is likely to throw them off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 It's a good idea to prime them to walking away from them by first changing your body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=74.7s	74.7	 position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=75.7s	75.7	 Maybe it means turning 45 degrees, 90 degrees or even 180 degrees and work on getting them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=80.6s	80.6	 to respond to you like that first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=83.2s	83.2	 Make her think more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 That way when you are in public, when you're outside of the house, she's more likely to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=87.9s	87.9	 get new concepts quicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 We want to find that distinct point in space where she says, I understand you to I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=95.6s	95.6	 understand you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=96.8s	96.8	 There is a very specific place in distance where dogs are like, I no longer get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=101.3s	101.3	 I've worked with Nina enough to have an idea of where this point was, but I wanted to verify
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=105.7s	105.7	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=106.7s	106.7	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=107.7s	107.7	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=115.1s	115.1	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=116.1s	116.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=117.1s	117.1	 So right here is pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=118.1s	118.1	 You know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=119.1s	119.1	 I like the idea of working your way up the stairs here and the end goal for today on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 this particular task being lie down while you stand way up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=127.7s	127.7	 When adding distance to the equation, make sure you start with something they know really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 well like sit or lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 You can see how Suzy doesn't continually ask Nina to lie down over and over again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 She immediately takes a step back and makes it easier on the next attempt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 This is what you should do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 Have the maturity and patience to go the extra mile and do this right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=161.5s	161.5	 And lots of small reasons to reward your dog when teaching them to respond to you from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=165.7s	165.7	 a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=166.7s	166.7	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=167.7s	167.7	 And go ahead and reward on sit even.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=169.1s	169.1	 That's fine too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=170.1s	170.1	 Just because right here I like that it's a greater distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 And you can see Nina is really starting to get the concept here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 We'll continue to build more and more distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 For a six month old dog, Nina is really knocking this out of the park, but there are still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=185.3s	185.3	 some bumps in the road ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 Nina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=189.9s	189.9	 See how she wanted to advance to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=191.3s	191.3	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=192.3s	192.3	 Don't let these moments go without correction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=194.2s	194.2	 Immediately take a step back and make it easier for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=197.5s	197.5	 She's trying to ease up on you, so let's bring her back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=200.5s	200.5	 We continued to work on this until Suzy was at her final destination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=204.4s	204.4	 So I want you to ask her to sit and lie down from way up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=207.8s	207.8	 Nina.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=210.8s	210.8	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=211.8s	211.8	 I'll reward her since I'm here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=214.9s	214.9	 Nina was making this look way too easy, so it was time to raise the bar a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 I'd like to do leave it with distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=221.1s	221.1	 Nina has already learned this concept of leaving something alone, but remember, whenever we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 add distance, we're making it much harder for our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=228.3s	228.3	 Each time we're introducing distance, we want to get them warmed up up close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=231.7s	231.7	 The first few tries we want to make quite easy for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=251.9s	251.9	 I'll be prepared to cover it up if she goes for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=254.7s	254.7	 Okay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=263.7s	263.7	 Jose has awesome communication with Nina.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QeolOvNQk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 Now it was Suzy's turn.
