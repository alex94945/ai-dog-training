https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today's video was sponsored by petflow.com slash Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 A few days ago I made a post on Facebook asking you for questions for this video and you guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=14.1s	14.1	 didn't disappoint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 We got lots of fantastic questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 Today I'm going to be addressing reactive dogs, introducing dogs for the first time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 what to do to get your dog to behave better when you're not there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=23.3s	23.3	 I'll talk about how to correct your dog when they're not doing what you want and I'll also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=26.5s	26.5	 do a little bit on clicker training too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 Also, remember if I don't get to your question in this video, I'm so pleased to be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 have an option for you to be able to get your question answered by me directly if you so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 require that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 Starting at $10 a month, I can answer your dog training questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 I'll have all those details in the description if that's for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=47.9s	47.9	 But remember for the rest of you, if that's not your thing, I've got tons of videos on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 virtually every topic imaginable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 I'm really determined to keep all of our content completely free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=57.2s	57.2	 I also like these Q&A videos because it gives me a chance to connect with you guys a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 bit better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=62.5s	62.5	 Of course, I'm commonly asked where do I get my dog food from?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 The answer to that question is petflow.com slash Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=69.8s	69.8	 Now, I love PetFlow because they make sure that my dog food is there when I need it so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=74.9s	74.9	 I don't have to be bothered by going out to the store and getting it when I run out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=79.5s	79.5	 Now, sure, first world problems, I get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 It's not that big a deal to go to the store and get your food, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=85.5s	85.5	 But if I can have it shipped to my house for the same price and I don't have to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 and it's always there, well, I'm going to select that option.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 I found it to be an amazing service.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=94.1s	94.1	 I've been with PetFlow for some time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=95.6s	95.6	 I know a lot of you have as well and their customer service is second to none.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=100.3s	100.3	 One of the reasons I'm so enthusiastic about having PetFlow as a sponsor on these videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 and actually giving my business to them as a customer is that they don't sell choke chains,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 prong collars, and electric collars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 I can feel a lot more comfortable about giving my money to a company like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=115.9s	115.9	 If you're interested in setting up automatic pet food delivery, all you have to do is select
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=119.7s	119.7	 the food you want and how often you want it delivered and enter code ZACH20 when you check out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=125.1s	125.1	 That way you'll get 20% off of your first order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=127.5s	127.5	 I'll have all of the information in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=130.7s	130.7	 This question comes from Heather.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=132.4s	132.4	 She asks, why in some videos do you use the clicker to train and in other training sessions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=137.3s	137.3	 you don't?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 Is it a preferable thing or do some dogs react better or worse to clicker training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=141.9s	141.9	 It seems like a waste of time if it's not necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=144.4s	144.4	 Wow, that is a good question, Heather.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 For those of you that have no idea what clicker training is, I'll have a video in the description
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=150.6s	150.6	 that will give you an introduction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=151.6s	151.6	 We have, gosh, what do we have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=153.4s	153.4	 30 plus thousand people per day viewing these videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 That's a huge assortment of different situations, different people, different dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=161.5s	161.5	 So I try and kind of cover my bases there and make sure that I have a method that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=165.7s	165.7	 really comfortable for a lot of different people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=169.7s	169.7	 My big thing with clicker training that I love is that it helps people get better at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=174.1s	174.1	 timing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=175.1s	175.1	 So it may be necessary to use it at first for you if you're really serious about getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=179.5s	179.5	 fast results because if you're new to dog training, chances are you haven't gotten really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 good at identifying the moment your dog does what you like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 So I wouldn't say it's a waste of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 The only things that I would require of my students and all of you when working with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 your dogs is that you keep training super fun for your dog and that you always have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=197.2s	197.2	 their best interest at heart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 Really good question, Heather.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=200.2s	200.2	 This next question comes from Germany from someone named Beate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=208.5s	208.5	 Hi Zach, I'm from Germany.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 I love your videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 They're a great help with my 11-week-old Labrador named Carla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 That's cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 I've got one question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 Here in Germany, you often hear the rule, never let dogs who are unknown to one another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=221.4s	221.4	 meet each other for the first time while on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=224.4s	224.4	 In one of your videos about socializing, all of the featured dogs are on leash, though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 they seem to interact just fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=229.5s	229.5	 So is this a rule or just a myth?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=232.3s	232.3	 I would be delighted if you addressed my question in a video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 In the video you're talking about, I had them on leash mainly because we were in a public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 park and there were cars around, so I just wanted to be extra safe in that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=243.2s	243.2	 Otherwise, I may have had them off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=245.1s	245.1	 But the answer to your question is it totally depends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=247.7s	247.7	 I mean, this is a vast wide spectrum and every single dog is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=251.8s	251.8	 Some dogs are thrilled to interact with another dog, whether they're on leash or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 Other dogs are like, look, I'll interact with you, but I don't want to feel restrained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 by the leash because that makes me frustrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 It makes me act all crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=261.6s	261.6	 Now for you in your specific situation, you have a very young dog and I think on or off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=265.9s	265.9	 leashes is fine for a young dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 It's adult dogs that typically have undesirable behavior when on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 But the real question here isn't about whether or not dogs act favorably with one another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=279.6s	279.6	 while on leash versus off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 Whether or not the dog should be exercised prior to meeting each other for the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=286.4s	286.4	 time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=287.4s	287.4	 That's the big one because even when two dogs go at it for when they meet for the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=290.3s	290.3	 time, that's usually due to a lack of an outlet for their energy just before meeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=295.9s	295.9	 And so you get all this crazy behavior that is just a symptom of not being exercised enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 So that actually is the most important point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 If possible, I like to see dogs introduced off leash together in a safe area, but I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 want to make sure that their energy is thoroughly out of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=312.9s	312.9	 And of course, if they don't have a history of fighting with dogs, if they do, we would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=317.1s	317.1	 approach that a bit differently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=319.3s	319.3	 This question comes from Hannah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=320.9s	320.9	 Hi Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=321.9s	321.9	 I'm wondering if I can get advice from my border collie, Spiky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=324.6s	324.6	 He's two years old and he's very reactive on lead constantly lunges as he's been attacked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 by a few dogs while we have been on walks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 He becomes nervous on lead, but he's fine off the lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 So you can see that some dogs are just fine when they're off the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=339.1s	339.1	 But like we were just talking about in the last question, you have some dogs who are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=342.3s	342.3	 you put a leash on me, I'm not going to act civilized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=344.7s	344.7	 When he is on lead, I try to keep his focus on me and I keep rewarding him with treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=349.4s	349.4	 and saying that he's a good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=351.5s	351.5	 Am I on the right track and what else can I do to help him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=355.3s	355.3	 I think you are on the right track based on what you said, but you didn't mention one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=359.2s	359.2	 very important thing and that is exercise prior to leash training, especially when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=363.8s	363.8	 know you're going to be around other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=365.7s	365.7	 It's unreasonable to expect a high energy, highly reactive dog to absorb new concepts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=371.5s	371.5	 at any rapid rate unless they've been exercised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=375.7s	375.7	 So while you say you've been trying to get his attention on you with the food and all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=378.7s	378.7	 that reactivity typically takes a lot of time and you will make very little progress if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=384.9s	384.9	 you are trying to bypass exercising them prior to this type of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=389.5s	389.5	 So that's, that's a required step in order to make reasonable progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=393.5s	393.5	 So when we're talking about reactive dogs, I mean, they come in all varieties, so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=398.3s	398.3	 never know how long it's going to take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=399.9s	399.9	 Some dogs typically get over this behavior pretty quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=403.1s	403.1	 Other dogs have a lifetime of this behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 Chances are if you're working with a reactive dog, though, you have noticed that when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=408.5s	408.5	 get too close to another dog, that that's when the behavior really accelerates and goes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=413.4s	413.4	 crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=414.4s	414.4	 So what do we do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=415.4s	415.4	 We create distance until we have compliance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=417.6s	417.6	 The way I test for compliance typically when engaging a another dog with a reactive dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=423.9s	423.9	 on leash is to ask them to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=426.0s	426.0	 If they don't sit, that generally tells me I'm too close to that distraction and I may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=430.4s	430.4	 even need to go out of sight in order to get the dog to listen to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=434.9s	434.9	 So be very patient with that exercise beforehand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=437.7s	437.7	 And I think you see these instances go way down until eventually it becomes a habit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 The logic is basically that if you can have enough training sessions in a row where you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=447.5s	447.5	 have exercised your dog and gotten them to behave appropriately, as you can usually do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=453.3s	453.3	 substantially easier if they're exercised, that even if you don't exercise them down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=460.0s	460.0	 the road, they will be so accustomed to listening to you in that type of situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=465.6s	465.6	 So it's not as though you have to do this forever before a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=468.8s	468.8	 But if your dog is really bad on a leash, whether they're reactive or they just pull
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=472.5s	472.5	 and they're really hyper, playing fetch with them in the backyard or at a local park before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=477.0s	477.0	 doing serious training is strongly advised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=479.9s	479.9	 If you can't do that, even some indoor fetch is fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=483.3s	483.3	 This next question comes from Megan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=485.5s	485.5	 I would like to know whether or not it would be beneficial for my one year old Maltese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=488.7s	488.7	 poodle to have a canine companion for when I'm not around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=493.7s	493.7	 I'm gone between five to seven hours a day, three times a week for work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=497.5s	497.5	 And if he would benefit from a companion, should it be another male or female?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=502.1s	502.1	 So generally, I don't recommend that you get a second dog for the purpose of keeping your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=506.0s	506.0	 first dog company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=508.3s	508.3	 But you do need to understand, usually when this question is presented to me, it's from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=511.6s	511.6	 someone who's having behavior issues out of their dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=514.2s	514.2	 I'll say something like, hey, your dog needs exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=516.7s	516.7	 So maybe they'll reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=517.7s	517.7	 Well, if I get another dog, you know, that'll get them exercised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=521.1s	521.1	 I have noticed a real strong correlation, though, between exercise with people versus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=526.1s	526.1	 exercise with other dogs in terms of reduction of undesired behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=530.5s	530.5	 Exercise with a person, things like fetch, dog sports, even hiking are much more fulfilling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=535.6s	535.6	 to a dog than simply running around with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=538.5s	538.5	 It also depends on the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=539.7s	539.7	 If you have a super high energy dog, they probably need a little bit more than just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=543.9s	543.9	 a another doggy playmate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=545.9s	545.9	 In your situation, you sound really passionate about your dogs and really want them to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=551.0s	551.0	 happy and I appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=552.3s	552.3	 So it's really a personal decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=553.7s	553.7	 If you feel like you're ready for another dog and you're ready to put in the time to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=557.7s	557.7	 One important note, you can't reasonably teach two dogs simultaneously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=562.8s	562.8	 So if you do get two dogs, a lot of people will get two dogs from the same litter, for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=566.2s	566.2	 example, and you need to be prepared to put that time in with each dog individually while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=571.1s	571.1	 the other dog is up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=572.1s	572.1	 So it's twice as much time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=573.5s	573.5	 Another option for many of you out there is to put your current dog in doggy daycare a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=577.3s	577.3	 few times a week when you are working and that'll give them the satisfaction of playing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=581.3s	581.3	 with other dogs and keep you from having to raise another dog for the next 10 to 15 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=586.6s	586.6	 And there was one more part to your question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=588.3s	588.3	 If you do get another dog, should it be male or female?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=590.7s	590.7	 Broadly speaking, you're going to have less instances of aggression with male and female
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=596.5s	596.5	 dogs versus same sex dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=598.7s	598.7	 So you know, that might be something to think about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=601.3s	601.3	 However, remember, most dogs are probably going to get along just fine, even if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=604.6s	604.6	 are the same sex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=606.3s	606.3	 This question comes from Tandy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=607.9s	607.9	 Tandy says your current videos have been more focused on obedience behavior and house manners,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=613.0s	613.0	 which is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=614.2s	614.2	 more trick training or frisbee videos in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=616.9s	616.9	 I do have a playlist for teaching your dog some tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=620.0s	620.0	 I'll have those in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=622.7s	622.7	 I love that you asked about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=624.2s	624.2	 Tricks are a great way to build communication with a dog and to really take your training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=628.4s	628.4	 to the next level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=629.6s	629.6	 It's a hard sell to the public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=630.9s	630.9	 I have to admit, though, most people don't see the virtue of teaching tricks to their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=635.5s	635.5	 dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=636.5s	636.5	 It's where I started out my career.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=637.7s	637.7	 I started off my career doing competitive freestyle frisbee, which was a lot of elaborate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=642.3s	642.3	 tricks combined with frisbees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=643.9s	643.9	 My last two television shows who let the dogs out on the BBC and Superfetch on Animal Planet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=650.6s	650.6	 center around teaching dogs tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=653.5s	653.5	 So tricks are a wonderful thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=655.6s	655.6	 But your question is, am I going to make more videos about them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=657.5s	657.5	 Well, of course I will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=658.5s	658.5	 I'm in this for the long haul.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=670.7s	670.7	 What is awesome with Zach George's style is his motivational techniques.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=674.0s	674.0	 But what is less emphasized and I'm eager to learn is how to tell the dog, hey, I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=679.5s	679.5	 like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=680.5s	680.5	 How do you communicate what you don't like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=682.0s	682.0	 Because you'll hear me all the time say, you know, find reasons to reward your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=686.3s	686.3	 Let them know what you do like instead of what you don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=689.1s	689.1	 Now, that's not to be confused or shouldn't be confused with, hey, never communicate to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=692.9s	692.9	 your dog what you don't like.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=698.7s	698.7	 hey, I don't like that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=703.3s	703.3	 Let's take the classic example of a dog chewing up a couch cushion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=706.6s	706.6	 If there was a dog chewing up my couch right now, what would I do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=709.7s	709.7	 Well, I would stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=711.1s	711.1	 I would clap my hands, get their attention off of the couch if possible, you know, assuming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=716.0s	716.0	 they hadn't done too much damage and get their eyes on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=718.7s	718.7	 And of course, call them over, take the treats from here and reward them because I'm going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=722.0s	722.0	 to have treats all over my house at room temperature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=724.7s	724.7	 Dog treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=725.7s	725.7	 You should have those scattered throughout your house if you've got a new dog so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=728.3s	728.3	 you can promptly reward them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=730.5s	730.5	 That is a form of correction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=731.6s	731.6	 I got them to stop and got their eyes on me and then was able to reward the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=735.4s	735.4	 they paid attention to me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=738.5s	738.5	 Now that even would have been unnecessary had I been doing a better job of controlling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=743.9s	743.9	 the environment, something people really struggle with, especially if you're new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=748.8s	748.8	 What I'm saying is the need to correct undesired behavior is far less necessary when you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=757.2s	757.2	 do a good job of controlling your dog's environment for that first six to 12 months of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=762.6s	762.6	 So if your dog isn't in a position to do property damage, they likely don't get in the habit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=767.5s	767.5	 of doing the property damage.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=775.3s	775.3	 you're in a better position to communicate with them what you do like and of course what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=779.3s	779.3	 you don't like because even when they're tied to your leash, they can still get into trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=782.4s	782.4	 They can still start gnawing on the desk or something like that, but you're right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=786.2s	786.2	 to correct it, get their attention off of the desk, onto you, whereby you reward and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=790.3s	790.3	 you do that with overwhelming consistency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=793.1s	793.1	 And the more consistent you are, the faster you get the results you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=797.7s	797.7	 That really is all there is to it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=800.2s	800.2	 It's easy to be consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=801.6s	801.6	 There are things in dog training that take more time, like timing, for example, and like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=806.0s	806.0	 getting to read dogs and understanding body language and all that stuff.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUAqezRTCCY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=548&pp=iAQB&t=816.0s	816.0	 So, really good question.
