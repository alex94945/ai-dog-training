https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 Look at that sweet little Doberman. They're on YouTube right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 Dogs are weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=9.4s	9.4	 But some of the things they do are weirder than others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 Let's talk about some of the strange things that dogs do and what they mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 Give a thumbs up for Piper the Doberman.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 Here's some advice that's good for everyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 Stop making special trips to the store.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=29.1s	29.1	 Or only lug heavy bags of food across town two to three times a month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=32.3s	32.3	 It's okay. You can have it now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 Have your dog's food automatically shipped to you from PetFlow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=36.6s	36.6	 Go to the link in the description.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 And tell PetFlow how often you want it to be delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 Enter code ZACH30 when you check out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 And you'll get $10 off your first three orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=47.6s	47.6	 I'll have all the details in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 So why is it that dogs growl?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 Well, you know, sometimes when dogs growl, it can be quite upsetting to many people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=54.8s	54.8	 And the unpleasant type of growling that we're talking about here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=57.7s	57.7	 usually means that a dog is uncomfortable or uneasy about something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 But you know what? That type of growling isn't really a bad thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 It's important for dogs to communicate how they're feeling so that we can take steps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 to put them at ease or make them feel more comfortable and keep things from escalating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 It's how you react to growling that makes all the difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=75.8s	75.8	 Often, our instinct as humans is to combat growling instead of understanding it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=80.1s	80.1	 and addressing the cause, possibly a dog being unsure, rather than the symptom, the dog growling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 For example, if your dog is growling to protect their food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=88.7s	88.7	 then some counter conditioning exercises are in order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Growling could be as harmless as a dog just announcing their location
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 so that others in the household might know where they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=96.5s	96.5	 Also, growling is really common during play like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=99.4s	99.4	 See, now that growl just simply means, hey, I'm having a good time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=102.5s	102.5	 This is fun. At least I hope so anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 I've always thought it's kind of strange how dogs like to tug on a rope
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=108.2s	108.2	 with you pulling on the other end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=110.2s	110.2	 I don't think I'll ever understand that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=111.9s	111.9	 It's when we push our dogs over the edge that growling really has the potential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=115.6s	115.6	 to accelerate into more serious behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=118.3s	118.3	 I love playing tug with you. Man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=120.8s	120.8	 Our job when trying to reduce unwanted growling is to keep them at ease
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=124.2s	124.2	 while slowly trying to make them more comfortable in whatever situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=127.4s	127.4	 is causing them to feel uneasy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 In short, growling can mean about a thousand different things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=132.1s	132.1	 So it's important to understand context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=134.8s	134.8	 Why do you think that dogs pant?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=136.4s	136.4	 Well, most of the time when dogs are panting, it's because they're overheated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=139.4s	139.4	 and that's their way to cool off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=140.7s	140.7	 Now, dogs can't sweat through their skin like we do, but they do sweat through their paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 Are these paws sweaty?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=146.4s	146.4	 Panting helps them circulate cool air through their bodies to cool them down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=149.9s	149.9	 But panting doesn't always mean your dog is hot, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 Your dog could also be panting because they're nervous or uncomfortable or even excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=157.2s	157.2	 Pay attention to context if you notice that your dog is panting a lot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=161.1s	161.1	 especially if it's cool and they haven't been working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=163.1s	163.1	 For example, you might notice increased panting at the vet or the groomer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 or other potentially stressful environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 Consider what else might be causing your dog to pant or act this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 Understanding your dog's subtle body language in different situations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=175.7s	175.7	 is really key to understanding them as a whole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=177.8s	177.8	 How about licking? I mean, why do dogs lick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 Now, of course, we can't presume to know what's going on in any dog's mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=184.1s	184.1	 But in my personal experience and in the experience of many others,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 licking is almost certainly a sign of affection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=191.9s	191.9	 Can you not feel the love and affection coming from Piper right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 Your dog might even be conditioned to lick you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=196.9s	196.9	 I mean, think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=197.7s	197.7	 Sometimes when our dogs lick us, we tend to pet them back in return.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=201.8s	201.8	 But in no time, that licking can get out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=205.2s	205.2	 Dogs often lick to groom themselves, kind of like cats do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=208.2s	208.2	 But if your dog is excessively licking themselves somewhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=210.8s	210.8	 you may want to talk to your vet about a possible allergy or other medical issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 If your dog is licking surfaces excessively, they might have an upset stomach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=217.7s	217.7	 I'm going to include a link in the description to a study
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 that found that many dogs who do lick surfaces excessively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=222.8s	222.8	 could have gastrointestinal issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 Now, if your dog is licking their lips, particularly excessively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=227.6s	227.6	 and in specific situations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 that's very often a sign of increased anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=231.7s	231.7	 So in those cases, you'd want to do your best to really understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 what it is that might be making your dog feel anxious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 And remember, the best cure for almost all types of anxiety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 is good old fashioned exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=242.8s	242.8	 Sometimes a great approach to reduce licking behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=245.4s	245.4	 is giving them something else to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=246.9s	246.9	 Closely watch your dog and give them a fun chew toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=249.1s	249.1	 Over time, you may be able to break the habit if you're consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 Do any of your dogs eat grass?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=253.2s	253.2	 Have you ever wondered why dogs eat grass?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 Lots of dogs just like eating grass, especially when they're hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=258.5s	258.5	 What's up with that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=259.4s	259.4	 It's a really common misconception that dogs eat grass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 because they have an upset stomach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=263.8s	263.8	 There have been a couple really interesting studies on this topic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=266.2s	266.2	 to try and get to the bottom of this behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 And none of them found any significant link between grass eating and vomiting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=271.6s	271.6	 or nutrient deficiencies in their diets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 In fact, it seems that grass eating is just normal dog behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=276.9s	276.9	 You guys are so weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaxP4DZeXk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=278.4s	278.4	 Why do you like to eat grass?
