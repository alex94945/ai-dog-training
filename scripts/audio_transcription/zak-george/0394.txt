https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 If not, those links will be below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=7.6s	7.6	 PepFlo has been an amazing sponsor of our videos for years now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 They'll make sure that your dog food is automatically shipped to you in any time interval you prefer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=15.2s	15.2	 Maybe you want your food delivered every two weeks, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=17.9s	17.9	 They will make sure it's there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=19.4s	19.4	 In order to make the service easy to try, PepFlo is going to give you $10 off on your first three automatic shipments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 Just go to their site, pick your favorite food, and tell them how often you want it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=29.2s	29.2	 And enter code ZACH30 when you check out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=30.6s	30.6	 I'll have the link in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=32.3s	32.3	 I'm really excited about the dog that's coming over here today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 Seth, he's 13 years old and his dog Brew is like, I don't know, eight to 10 weeks somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 However, they're having problems with getting Brew to pay attention and just do, you know, some of the basic stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=44.4s	44.4	 So I'm hoping to clarify a lot of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=46.7s	46.7	 They're also having issues with potty training, biting, and, you know, apparently the list goes on and on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=52.1s	52.1	 I get it. It's a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=53.3s	53.3	 For those of you who are feeling disconnected with your own dog, it's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=56.8s	56.8	 And I'm going to help you with that today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 Seth, tell me about why you got Brew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=59.7s	59.7	 We've just been looking for a dog and Brew seemed like a good option rather than a husky or an other dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 because he's good with the climate and they're supposed to be easy to train and just loving dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Are you the main trainer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=72.4s	72.4	 I do take him out. I train him most of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=76.1s	76.1	 Why don't you show me what you've been doing with him just so I can kind of see how you guys work together?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=81.4s	81.4	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=82.4s	82.4	 So you've been using this chew toy here to kind of direct attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 That's nice. Okay. Interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 My fear, though, is that this isn't a strong enough currency to really get through to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 It's okay. He's interested in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=95.1s	95.1	 Moving forward, he's going to get bored with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=97.3s	97.3	 But I like that you're being unconventional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=99.2s	99.2	 I'll usually grab a chunk and I reward with pieces about that size right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=103.6s	103.6	 So make sure they're really tiny. It's the taste, not the quantity we're going after.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 Take your time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 Little awkward here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=110.4s	110.4	 See, you're trying to get traction. It's a communication building phase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 We don't yet have it. This is how you get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=115.1s	115.1	 It's clunky in the beginning, just like learning a new language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 Because neither one of you know how to really fluidly communicate with each other yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=121.5s	121.5	 That takes about four months. Show me. Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=124.5s	124.5	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=125.5s	125.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 Hey, good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=127.5s	127.5	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=128.5s	128.5	 Very nice. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=129.5s	129.5	 You have to teach him your language. He has to learn how to understand your language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 You have to teach him our traditions and our customs, so to speak, you know, like not going potty in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 Add to that that we're two different species complicates things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 The good news is every domestic dog on earth was specifically selected for listening and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 taking direction from human beings. It's in their DNA to be receptive to learning from us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=153.8s	153.8	 You know, they're not wild animals. We created these guys and we didn't continue to breed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=158.4s	158.4	 the ones that were bad at listening to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=161.2s	161.2	 What about lie down? Have you taught lie down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 I haven't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 Wait, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 Sit. Oh, lie down. Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 Not bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 Not bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 You told me you had no idea how to teach it. That was your first attempt. That was pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=176.5s	176.5	 Getting your dog's eyes on you when they're tempted by something is extremely important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=181.2s	181.2	 moving forward because there'll be times when he's barking at another dog. You'll want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=184.8s	184.8	 be able to get that attention on you so that you can say, stop doing that. Let's go over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=187.9s	187.9	 here and do this instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=189.2s	189.2	 There's leave it. Now can I get your eyes on me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=191.8s	191.8	 Hey, bro.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=196.8s	196.8	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=197.8s	197.8	 You do that like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 Just be patient. Wait for him to give up on it and then yes. Let him know. Give him a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=204.2s	204.2	 really decisive yes or good or something that stands out from your everyday speech to really

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=211.9s	211.9	 There you go. Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 Right around your age is where people start to become capable of really training dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 You're at the right age to get the job done if you're serious and you seem serious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 Teaching dogs is so much repetition. It really is like working with them over a period of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 many months doing these same things because once you get them doing something inside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=233.5s	233.5	 then it's time to take it outside and train it in public and then with distractions while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 in public and to just really keep adding on layers of difficulty as they start to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=242.9s	242.9	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=243.9s	243.9	 Puppy biting and potty training have been big issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 Neither one of those will result quickly. Puppy biting, it has to run its course. They
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=249.8s	249.8	 have to go through weeks of it. They're teething. They're trying to engage this brand new world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 So that's normal. Potty training also is a months long process. How often do you take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=258.7s	258.7	 him out when you're doing potty training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=260.4s	260.4	 Probably every hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=261.8s	261.8	 Nice job. Love it. Love that answer. I don't get that enough. Are accidents really common

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 Okay, got you. And what are you doing? I guess we should have taken him out. Is this your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 this young is that if they're attached to you, you can pick up on their cues a lot more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=281.0s	281.0	 that they want to go outside or that they're about to do their business. Have you been

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=302.4s	302.4	 potty training, though it should get much, much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=305.1s	305.1	 This is potty alarm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=306.4s	306.4	 So you have an alarm that goes off to remind you to take him out. Love that. This tug-of-war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 is pretty good for a nine week old dog. The grip is really good. One of the first things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 I like to do with dogs is see what their desire to play is like, specifically tug-of-war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=320.8s	320.8	 You mentioned that he's biting. One of the upsides to a dog who's going through the biting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=324.3s	324.3	 phase is they're a lot more eager to play tug-of-war like this. Tug-of-war is one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=328.2s	328.2	 the ultimate currencies to reward a dog with moving forward. So being able to put structure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=333.7s	333.7	 to this game, tug, and let go really quick can open up so many angles for training. There's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=339.3s	339.3	 three main options you have when you're dealing with a puppy who's going through that enthusiastic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=344.3s	344.3	 biting phase. You can either redirect them into a game of tug like this. So essentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=350.2s	350.2	 you're saying, okay, if you want to bite, I'll give you something to bite on that you can bite on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=353.1s	353.1	 And we can play and we can have a good time. Because typically there's so many reasons that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 a dog bites, but the main ones are they want to engage you and they're teething. So there's a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=363.0s	363.0	 of things going on there. This is a way for him to engage me in an acceptable way. Also, what I love
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=368.1s	368.1	 about this is that it really promotes a bond between you and the dog because he's having a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=371.8s	371.8	 time it seems right now. And I'm certainly enjoying it. So when both the person and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=376.4s	376.4	 trainer are having a lot of fun, that's definitely good for the foundation of training a dog. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=381.8s	381.8	 other way is to use a treat and turn it into a basic training lesson. When you give a dog a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 their biting tends to quell. They're more like, oh, I'm more in food mode instead of play mode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=392.8s	392.8	 right now. When he's biting there, what we want to do, this is one way to do it. You can redirect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 his attention. The reason we're giving him a treat is just to kind of shift their focus into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=401.4s	401.4	 a more standard obedience training session. Sit. It's a good way to say I'd prefer that you sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=406.7s	406.7	 and lie down and listen to me in a way that doesn't involve biting me right now. Then the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=411.8s	411.8	 third option is if you're just too busy, put him in an environment where he can't bite you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=416.5s	416.5	 So in a bedroom or something like that. So that keeps the biting from at least occurring. But of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=421.3s	421.3	 course that doesn't train him, but it keeps the habit from continuing to happen. I like to really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=426.4s	426.4	 get them used to being touched firmly all over because being touched often triggers the puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=431.6s	431.6	 biting. They're not used to it. They're like, let go of me. I don't want to be grabbed. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=434.9s	434.9	 kind of unsettling touching their feet, their ears, sensitive areas like this, you know, for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=440.0s	440.0	 20 minutes a day. You have no idea how ridiculous you look right now. We're having trouble on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=445.4s	445.4	 training with the, uh, how he pulls. Leash training is one that really trips up a lot of people. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=450.2s	450.2	 I mean, especially the fact that he's going to be a big dog, I can understand why you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=453.9s	453.9	 prioritize leash training. However, that's, that's actually a fairly advanced concept and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=459.4s	459.4	 there are more important things right now, more important communication that needs to be established.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=463.5s	463.5	 So it's kind of a fine line. On one hand, you don't want them to get in the habit of pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=467.1s	467.1	 On the other hand, he still needs to sniff around, enjoy the world, kind of experience it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=472.2s	472.2	 More valuable would be fetch training. He's probably going to be a higher energy dog, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=477.8s	477.8	 guessing, at least a level two and a half probably, or 2.2 somewhere in there out of three. The reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=483.8s	483.8	 fetch is, I mean, so critical is that when it comes time to get serious about leash training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=490.4s	490.4	 you must have a way to get his energy out of him before the session begins. It's not reasonable to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=497.4s	497.4	 expect a dog to retain the concept of walking slowly next to a person while tethered to a leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=503.9s	503.9	 unless their energy has been depleted just prior to the training session. Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=510.1s	510.1	 Because they have all this pent up energy. I mean, you think about, you know, golden retrievers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=514.0s	514.0	 poodles have been bred for hundreds of years to have lots of endurance, lots of energy, lots of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=519.7s	519.7	 stamina. That doesn't go away just because we live in the 21st century and have normal jobs, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=525.1s	525.1	 that don't require them to be in the fields. So fetch, long story short, is the way to get that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=531.8s	531.8	 energy out and get the satisfaction of them working with a human being. This is how fetch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=536.1s	536.1	 training starts six inches away. Most people do that, throw it across the room, maybe he'll get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=542.2s	542.2	 it. Let's see. And but is he going to return it directly to me? Come on. Oh, wow. Okay, made a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=547.8s	547.8	 liar out of me. That was pretty good. But you don't want to assume that's always going to happen. In
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=551.5s	551.5	 other words, we want to keep that perfect process going. So the way to do that is yes, just to throw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=558.2s	558.2	 it an inch away. And when he picks it up automatically reignite the game of tug of war. In other words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=563.2s	563.2	 fetch training starts with tug of war. And of course, teaching let go. Well, good, fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=568.6s	568.6	 Lots of short reps are much more important. He doesn't get a lot of energy out that way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=572.2s	572.2	 but you're getting the mechanics down. But let me see how he's doing on leash walking anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=576.0s	576.0	 Are you using treats when you do your leash walking? Usually just good praise. And we haven't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=580.6s	580.6	 brought the treats on the walk, but I think you need to do that on every walk. That's that's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=584.2s	584.2	 real common rookie mistake trying to get by without treats, especially with initial training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=588.9s	588.9	 Got to be generous with treats. How are you going to reinforce it? Because I think it's natural
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=593.1s	593.1	 for us as people to be like, the dog should just listen to me. I shouldn't have to bring treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctum1G76sLI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=395&pp=iAQB&t=597.0s	597.0	 everywhere and use treats all the time. I mean, I've been of that mindset at one time in my life
