https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Welcome to episode two of the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=2.9s	2.9	 We have just gotten home here in New Orleans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 with my brand new puppy, Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=7.4s	7.4	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=8.6s	8.6	 I train dogs and this is my new dog, Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=12.3s	12.3	 I'm taking you along as I train her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 You can start from the beginning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=16.5s	16.5	 or pick up anywhere and start learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 It's pretty late right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=23.1s	23.1	 She does need to go to bed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=24.3s	24.3	 but she's also been sleeping most of the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 So I've got two things to do immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 I need to get her bedroom set up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=30.3s	30.3	 and I've got to get her exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=31.8s	31.8	 Hey, what's up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 What's going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=33.7s	33.7	 Almost immediately, I want to acclimate her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=36.2s	36.2	 to her outside place to go potty,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 but we'll cover her indoor option in a sec.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 This is her first time seeing our backyard here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 Just going potty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 Hey, you want to play?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 You want to play?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=48.5s	48.5	 You know, I can't resist a puppy who wants to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 So let's play then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=51.7s	51.7	 Boy, nothing like fetch at 10 o'clock at night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=55.5s	55.5	 Okay, let's go back inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=56.7s	56.7	 I'm going to give you a tour of my plan for tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=59.9s	59.9	 Now, everything doesn't always go according to plan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=62.6s	62.6	 but I'm hoping this is going to be okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 I'm actually going to get in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=65.6s	65.6	 I'm hoping this is high enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=66.8s	66.8	 If not, I've ordered a higher one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=68.3s	68.3	 because she might be able to jump up and climb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=70.2s	70.2	 I'm not sure yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 We'll just have to see about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=72.4s	72.4	 So I've got a crate here with a divider panel in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=74.6s	74.6	 I like oversized crates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 but the divider panel stops about here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 And since it's her first night at this house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=80.5s	80.5	 I want to make sure that she has plenty of room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=82.4s	82.4	 where she can come out here and go pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=84.2s	84.2	 Because remember, I want her to be pad trained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 in addition to being trained to go potty outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 Sometimes there's bad weather or any other reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=91.3s	91.3	 that I can't think of where I might want her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 to have the option to go inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 I'm going to go ahead and set her down right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=96.3s	96.3	 I'm going to take her off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 Notice I'm not letting her off leash in the house at all yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=100.9s	100.9	 And since she's eight weeks old,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=102.4s	102.4	 I'm probably going to put this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 and a few other chew toys in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 The hope is she'll just crash here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=106.6s	106.6	 In the middle of the night,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=107.4s	107.4	 she can get up and go on her WizSmart pad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 because instinctively dogs don't like to relieve themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 in their direct sleeping area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=114.3s	114.3	 These were really helpful at her first night
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=116.1s	116.1	 at the hotel last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 WizSmart pads are the best pee and potty pads that I know of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=120.1s	120.1	 I like that they're shockingly absorbent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=122.2s	122.2	 That allows them to dry almost instantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=124.3s	124.3	 So your dog's not tracking their pee everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=126.6s	126.6	 You can see how thick they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=128.1s	128.1	 relative to traditional potty pads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 I'm going to have a link below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 where you can get these WizSmart pads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 Now I'm not always going to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=134.2s	134.2	 such a large number of pads out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=136.1s	136.1	 Eventually I'm going to relocate the pads
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=138.1s	138.1	 to another part of the house and have maybe four down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=140.6s	140.6	 as she starts to get the hang of potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=142.8s	142.8	 I'm going to give her some food in her crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 Nothing can get a dog comfortable quite like food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 All right, it's time to get ready for bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 It is Inersha's first night at my house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=150.9s	150.9	 You'll recall from my last episode,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=153.5s	153.5	 it ended up with Inersha and me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 cuddling on the floor in the motel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=157.4s	157.4	 So I've decided to sleep down here with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=159.3s	159.3	 just to make sure she's comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=160.4s	160.4	 So we have a blow up mattress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=161.8s	161.8	 and I'm going to turn it on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 but I know it can make a loud sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=164.2s	164.2	 I don't know how she's likely to react to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=166.1s	166.1	 So let's see what she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 I'm going to turn it on kind of quietly here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=170.4s	170.4	 Right there, you see her react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=171.8s	171.8	 So that's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=172.4s	172.4	 Being extra sensitive to things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=174.3s	174.3	 that might cause an unpleasant reaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 from your dog is recommended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 Things like motorized sounds or other sounds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 can be off-putting to some dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 Yes, you're doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 By the way, if you're wondering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=185.3s	185.3	 what kind of treats I'm using,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=186.2s	186.2	 I'm using a whole combination of different treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 just to mix it up, experiment and see what she likes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=194.1s	194.1	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=195.4s	195.4	 And since everything's going pretty normal here,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=198.7s	198.7	 Normally I might go a bit slower than this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 but I'm really tired.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=201.8s	201.8	 Night two with a puppy, who wouldn't be, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=204.7s	204.7	 Oh, what is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=205.9s	205.9	 She took notice of the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=207.2s	207.2	 that this has inflated before her eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=209.5s	209.5	 Okay, it looks like she's over it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 Now that my sleeping accommodations are complete,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=213.8s	213.8	 it's time to let our sometimes reactive senior dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 Indy, outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=218.1s	218.1	 This will actually be the first time Indy sees inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=221.2s	221.2	 We're not prepared to introduce them just yet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 and we're just going to have her walk past to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=225.7s	225.7	 What is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 Indy's like, hey, if you got treats, I'll listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=229.6s	229.6	 And inertia was like, whoa, there's a surprise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=232.7s	232.7	 You guys will meet later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=234.1s	234.1	 Update, it's later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 I don't know how much later,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 but I've modified the pen here to be a bit smaller.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=239.5s	239.5	 The reason I modified it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=240.7s	240.7	 because she was getting a little too active,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=243.1s	243.1	 and I've also increased the number of chew toys for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=246.0s	246.0	 So I think she's going to be content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 We'll see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 Okay, night two went way better than night one at the hotel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 You can see episode one to see how we handled her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 waking up in the middle of the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 Good morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 You want to go outside?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 Hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 Overall, inertia slept really well last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 She whined a little bit, but promptly went back to sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 I see that she used her pee pads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=264.5s	264.5	 This is why I want to have pads available,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 just so when she does have to go, if I'm unconscious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=268.9s	268.9	 she has a place to go that isn't our normal marble floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=271.9s	271.9	 Now I want to take her outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=273.4s	273.4	 so that she can also experience going outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=275.9s	275.9	 Okay, so far so good on potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=277.8s	277.8	 Now it's time to give her a puppy workout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=280.0s	280.0	 I'm going to work on some morning fetch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=281.5s	281.5	 with her puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=282.9s	282.9	 I'm sure that may evolve into her routine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=284.1s	284.1	 We've done a little bit outside, but it's a little warm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 I put inertia up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 We just had a little play session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=289.5s	289.5	 and I can't believe how well inertia is doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=292.8s	292.8	 It's like she never acts up at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=294.6s	294.6	 And she's having a bit of a puppy anxiety attack here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=297.8s	297.8	 So I'm going to let this play out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 for probably a few minutes on my own time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=301.4s	301.4	 I won't make you guys sit through it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=302.9s	302.9	 but the reason I'm sharing this with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=304.3s	304.3	 is to show you how normal this stuff really is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 Puppies are going to get anxious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=308.3s	308.3	 when you leave them alone sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 So I'm going to let her sit for a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 She's going to get anxious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=311.9s	311.9	 when you leave them alone sometimes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=313.1s	313.1	 but I've got to make my lunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=314.7s	314.7	 and I want to make sure she's in a safe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=316.2s	316.2	 controlled environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=317.8s	317.8	 I find it helpful in situations like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=320.6s	320.6	 to set a timer because it can be maddening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=322.6s	322.6	 if you're not used to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=323.9s	323.9	 It can be very frustrating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 when your dog is throwing a fit like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 Hey Siri, set a timer for five minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 Within five minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=330.6s	330.6	 she's probably going to settle down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=331.6s	331.6	 that's kind of in her pattern with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=333.1s	333.1	 Maybe it's 10 minutes, maybe it's 20 minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=335.4s	335.4	 maybe it's two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=336.2s	336.2	 Notice the different vocalizations too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=341.4s	341.4	 Some of them are howling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=343.1s	343.1	 others are more frantic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 some of them are more subdued, more relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 All these little things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=348.4s	348.4	 that's what you have to interpret
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=349.5s	349.5	 and get to know with your own dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=350.8s	350.8	 Usually the louder like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=352.2s	352.2	 the more anxiety they're experiencing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=355.0s	355.0	 Looks like she's starting to settle down a little.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=356.9s	356.9	 Whining has subsided.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 We have three minutes and 16 seconds left now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=360.8s	360.8	 on the five minute timer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 She'll probably do some more whimpering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=363.6s	363.6	 and then maybe she'll pass out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=364.6s	364.6	 Puppies like this need to sleep for 16, 18 hours a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=367.8s	367.8	 It's ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=368.7s	368.7	 So I don't feel too bad about encouraging her to sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=371.3s	371.3	 She's growing so rapidly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=372.7s	372.7	 In this case, I don't think it's really necessary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=374.6s	374.6	 to reinforce with food as she calms down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=376.9s	376.9	 Rather, I just kind of want her to achieve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=378.8s	378.8	 a calm state of mind just naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=381.0s	381.0	 I think a big reason as to why she's behaving like this too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=384.5s	384.5	 is clearly the massive adjustment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=387.1s	387.1	 she's had to go through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=388.5s	388.5	 She's had relatively free range to live on her farm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=392.2s	392.2	 where she came from with her mom and her siblings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=395.1s	395.1	 And now she's without all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=396.4s	396.4	 It's gotta be a lot of stress on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=398.2s	398.2	 So if your dog stresses out like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=399.8s	399.8	 or you're having any other issue with your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=402.2s	402.2	 I'll have a link to both of my books below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 So that was a little bit longer than five minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=406.0s	406.0	 That was actually about eight or nine minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=407.6s	407.6	 That's one of her more significant outbursts, I would say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=410.7s	410.7	 After she sleeps for an hour or two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=412.2s	412.2	 I'm gonna work with her some more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=413.1s	413.1	 I'm gonna do some training with her and exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=414.9s	414.9	 to give her that mental and physical stimulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=416.9s	416.9	 Because if you're not doing the regular training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=418.7s	418.7	 and you're not doing the regular exercise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=420.5s	420.5	 and it's not reasonable to expect your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=422.4s	422.4	 to settle down eventually, you have to meet them halfway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=425.2s	425.2	 But if you're fair to them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=426.1s	426.1	 that's why I don't feel guilty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=427.2s	427.2	 when she has that outburst right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=428.8s	428.8	 Because I know I'm spending a lot of time with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=430.8s	430.8	 and giving her that exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=432.2s	432.2	 She's got her food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=433.1s	433.1	 She's been outside to go potty and you know, all that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=435.7s	435.7	 So I've checked all the boxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 Now that Inersha has been asleep for a few minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=439.4s	439.4	 I'm going to keep up her sound desensitization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=441.8s	441.8	 so that she's encouraged to sleep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=443.4s	443.4	 no matter what's going on around her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=445.3s	445.3	 Part of my strategy is to really keep her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=447.9s	447.9	 desensitized to sounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=450.4s	450.4	 Gonna make these sounds here, walk past her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=452.3s	452.3	 And I know what you might be thinking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=453.4s	453.4	 well, she just got quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=454.3s	454.3	 Why would you do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=455.1s	455.1	 I'm all about letting sleeping dogs lie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=457.3s	457.3	 But at the same time, if I can sit here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=458.7s	458.7	 and talk at this normal or loud voice here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=461.0s	461.0	 and she still stays asleep,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=462.4s	462.4	 I'm really desensitizing her to that when she's sleeping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=464.9s	464.9	 and she learns how to relax under these louder situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=469.0s	469.0	 So there she woke up a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=470.4s	470.4	 but I'm just trying to find what it takes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=472.4s	472.4	 And at this age, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=473.4s	473.4	 they just go back to sleep so easily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=474.9s	474.9	 Today is a big day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=475.8s	475.8	 I want to start preparing her for getting a bath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=477.8s	477.8	 cutting her nails and brushing her teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=479.5s	479.5	 But she's wound up after that nap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=481.6s	481.6	 So I need to get some of that energy out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=483.5s	483.5	 to make the experience as pleasant as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=486.6s	486.6	 She needs to learn fetch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=488.0s	488.0	 but that's gonna take many, many weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=490.3s	490.3	 Never too soon to start though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=491.6s	491.6	 You have to really kind of teach your dog the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=493.8s	493.8	 before you can reliably get their energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=495.9s	495.9	 So I'm gonna get her interested in a new squeaky toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=498.3s	498.3	 We have so many different toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=499.7s	499.7	 She's really tracking a lot better too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=501.5s	501.5	 And she's very young,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=502.4s	502.4	 so we're conservative with exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=503.9s	503.9	 It's so fun to watch them discover new things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=505.9s	505.9	 Look at that curiosity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=507.1s	507.1	 That curiosity is such a great sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=509.1s	509.1	 Look at the play bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=510.2s	510.2	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=511.1s	511.1	 Oh, that's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=512.1s	512.1	 I'm just gonna let this go here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=513.5s	513.5	 because she's moving around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=514.9s	514.9	 Of course, a puppy's favorite toy is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=517.0s	517.0	 well, usually human flesh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=519.3s	519.3	 This play biting is pretty fun right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=521.1s	521.1	 I don't mind her biting right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=522.3s	522.3	 as long as it's not too hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=523.4s	523.4	 That shows her how to use her bite pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=525.8s	525.8	 That's all healthy stuff too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=527.0s	527.0	 I don't want her to be afraid to use her mouth at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=529.1s	529.1	 So I'm not trying to discourage all biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=530.9s	530.9	 I'm just trying to discourage hard biting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=532.6s	532.6	 or biting without permission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=535.2s	535.2	 Oh my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=536.3s	536.3	 Look at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=537.4s	537.4	 Oh, you won.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=538.7s	538.7	 You're so strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=539.9s	539.9	 She's been exercised and mentally stimulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=542.8s	542.8	 Now she should be more receptive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=544.4s	544.4	 to learning about this strange concept of getting a bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=547.8s	547.8	 I don't wanna wait until it's time to give her a bath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=549.8s	549.8	 to then just get her comfortable with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=551.6s	551.6	 So I'm gonna try and get her comfortable with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=553.4s	553.4	 you know, one step at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=555.4s	555.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=556.1s	556.1	 That was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=557.0s	557.0	 Do you see what I did there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=557.8s	557.8	 I just turned on the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=559.0s	559.0	 See how she's not taking treats?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=560.4s	560.4	 She's really nervous right now for some reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=562.7s	562.7	 So we'll make it a little bit easier for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=564.2s	564.2	 Rather than just giving her a bath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=565.8s	565.8	 just get her used to a wet washcloth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=568.0s	568.0	 I don't think she wants to be in the sink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=569.4s	569.4	 So I'm gonna put her here on the counter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=570.6s	570.6	 We're gonna go real slow, lick her and reward her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=573.3s	573.3	 I'm gonna see if I can get away with having the water
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=574.9s	574.9	 on a little bit in the background.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=578.8s	578.8	 It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=579.8s	579.8	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=581.4s	581.4	 Yes, you're doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=583.2s	583.2	 Gonna touch her face a little there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=584.9s	584.9	 She's being very tolerant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=586.2s	586.2	 She's licking it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=587.4s	587.4	 See how she's a little less nervous now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=589.2s	589.2	 A little less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=589.8s	589.8	 I mean, I think if I were to put her in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=591.3s	591.3	 and just try to bathe her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=592.3s	592.3	 she would probably get a little nervous and freak out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=594.6s	594.6	 and that would set me back a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=596.6s	596.6	 This is how you build trust with a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=598.2s	598.2	 Get this more wet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=601.0s	601.0	 Oh, I love that she showed some initiative right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=603.3s	603.3	 and walked towards the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=604.5s	604.5	 I'm gonna touch her paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=606.0s	606.0	 She's doing great with having her paws touched.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=607.8s	607.8	 I've been doing that a lot lately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=609.4s	609.4	 You'll find if you just go real slow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=611.0s	611.0	 with this kind of stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=611.8s	611.8	 they usually are far more likely to do a lot better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=614.4s	614.4	 I'm gonna touch the inside of her ears here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=616.4s	616.4	 Just start desensitizing her to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=618.2s	618.2	 She reacted a little, but that's all pretty healthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=620.2s	620.2	 And so that was her first little sponge bath,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=622.0s	622.0	 a very light version of a bath, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=624.4s	624.4	 But these are the kind of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=625.5s	625.5	 I'll be doing this stuff a lot with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=627.1s	627.1	 just to get her more and more comfortable with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=628.8s	628.8	 The more often it happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=630.2s	630.2	 and the more gradually you ease your dog into this stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=632.9s	632.9	 the smoother raising them is gonna go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=635.4s	635.4	 You did so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=636.2s	636.2	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=637.6s	637.6	 All done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=639.2s	639.2	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=639.8s	639.8	 Oh, I like the wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=641.5s	641.5	 That was cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=642.9s	642.9	 That was cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=643.4s	643.4	 She just offered her paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=644.3s	644.3	 I've gotta click that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=645.1s	645.1	 When your dog does something you like on their own,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=647.0s	647.0	 let them know you like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=647.8s	647.8	 Bath training, check.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=649.4s	649.4	 Now let's begin getting her ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=650.6s	650.6	 for nail trimming in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=652.1s	652.1	 Nail clipping is another thing that dogs need to get used to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=654.5s	654.5	 Right now she's feeling a little bitey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=656.0s	656.0	 so this probably isn't the best time for nail trimming for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=658.6s	658.6	 I'll probably save it for when she's a little more fatigued from exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=662.2s	662.2	 But this is still good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=663.1s	663.1	 I can at least touch her with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=664.6s	664.6	 and get her used to the motion without clipping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=666.7s	666.7	 I'm gonna come around her nail, just put some pressure on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=669.3s	669.3	 This is just desensitizing, pure desensitizing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=672.2s	672.2	 That's a nice new feeling for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=674.1s	674.1	 and she's adjusting really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=675.6s	675.6	 I'm gonna give you a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=676.8s	676.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=677.8s	677.8	 And I'm not using the clicker here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=679.2s	679.2	 only because my hands are a bit full and that's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=681.4s	681.4	 Clicker training is great when you can use it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=683.3s	683.3	 If you can't, that's okay too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=685.0s	685.0	 It's not required.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=686.0s	686.0	 We're certainly gonna do more nail trimming in the future,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=688.2s	688.2	 but it's time to prepare her for tooth brushing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=690.6s	690.6	 I wanna be able to touch every bit of the inside of her mouth there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=693.8s	693.8	 with her reacting calmly and cooperatively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=696.1s	696.1	 I'm not restraining her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=697.2s	697.2	 She's not running away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=698.4s	698.4	 And I'm able to really stick my whole finger all over the place in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=701.8s	701.8	 Get your dog used to having their teeth brushed with just a finger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=704.6s	704.6	 before you even start anything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=706.2s	706.2	 Don't push them to where they start getting frustrated either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=708.8s	708.8	 Stop while they're doing well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=710.0s	710.0	 Okay, let me give her a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=711.2s	711.2	 And then I'll introduce a toothbrush to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=713.4s	713.4	 You might notice I've got a finger brush on my finger here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=715.6s	715.6	 This is for puppies to brush their teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=717.4s	717.4	 If you've ever tried to brush a dog's teeth who isn't prepared for it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=720.1s	720.1	 you'll know how tough that can be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=721.8s	721.8	 So we're going to get her used to it from a young age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=724.6s	724.6	 At least we're gonna try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=725.4s	725.4	 We're gonna see how she's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=726.2s	726.2	 I'm gonna put her on my lap here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=730.2s	730.2	 Yeah, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=732.0s	732.0	 Go ahead and give her a little bit of a tiny piece of meat there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=735.1s	735.1	 Let her know you're doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=737.8s	737.8	 What was that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=738.4s	738.4	 Was that a puppy burp?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=739.9s	739.9	 I'm gonna brush her canine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=741.5s	741.5	 When she shows resistance, I'm gonna stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=743.3s	743.3	 Because I'm not trying to show her how to get her teeth brushed in this training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=746.8s	746.8	 I'm just trying to ease her into it over the next days to weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=749.8s	749.8	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=750.8s	750.8	 Okay, that's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=751.7s	751.7	 And so I'm just gonna leave it there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=753.1s	753.1	 The important thing to understand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=754.8s	754.8	 don't wait until it's time to get your dog to do something to also train them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=759.4s	759.4	 One of the mistakes that we make if we're new to training dogs is you take the mindset,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-IjjzmS0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=763.9s	763.9	 oh, it's time to give them a bath.
