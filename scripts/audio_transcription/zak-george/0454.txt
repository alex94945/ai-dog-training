https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=294.9s	294.9	 check out our video that we did together in the description of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=297.7s	297.7	 This is Loki. Loki is when you're up and coming dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=300.0s	300.0	 What's the first thing you want to show us today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=301.5s	301.5	 I want to show you him praying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=303.9s	303.9	 Oh, that's got to be cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 Ready? Come here. Pause. Pray.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=308.4s	308.4	 Amen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=308.8s	308.8	 That is so cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=310.2s	310.2	 What religion is he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=311.3s	311.3	 I have no idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 They're all basically the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=313.8s	313.8	 Give us an overview of how you taught pray to Loki.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=316.1s	316.1	 Sure. So that behavior is actually two different tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=318.8s	318.8	 Okay. The first trick is paws up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=320.8s	320.8	 So what you can do is ask your dog for a sit pretty or you can lure them into a sit pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=324.7s	324.7	 So just like that and you would pop your arm under their paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=328.3s	328.3	 There's your paws up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=329.7s	329.7	 The next step is just to lure their head under with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 Then you transition that to like putting their hands on various things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=335.2s	335.2	 Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 Yeah. So I can lure them up onto the couch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=340.1s	340.1	 And then same with a treat under and then down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 Yes. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=344.9s	344.9	 Now this next one is going to be a bit more athletic in nature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=348.2s	348.2	 I'm going to show you some rebounds. Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=351.0s	351.0	 Whoa. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=352.5s	352.5	 Look at the focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=354.2s	354.2	 Off the hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=356.4s	356.4	 Yeah. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=357.7s	357.7	 There's a lot to a trick like that because he's got to get all four feet on you at separate times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=363.1s	363.1	 You've got to be completely still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=364.8s	364.8	 Show me how to teach it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 The most common way of teaching the rebound is just to get your dog to jump in your arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=369.6s	369.6	 I'm going to catch him just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=371.3s	371.3	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=372.3s	372.3	 Once you've mastered the art of catching your dog to get the rebound, you just don't catch them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=376.8s	376.8	 So I would throw a toy or a treat, ask them to jump up and throw something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=380.6s	380.6	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=381.0s	381.0	 And keeping them nice and low during that initial process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=383.5s	383.5	 By teaching your dog something like this, not only are you increasing their athleticism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 but you're showing them how to think in different ways,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=390.2s	390.2	 how to get lots of muscle memory to set up other things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=392.8s	392.8	 maybe frisbee tricks and stuff like that later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 Why don't you show us one of the tricks that crowds tend to go crazy over?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=398.1s	398.1	 It's actually Loki's favorite trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=399.9s	399.9	 So let's do that one and go. Ready, go back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=401.9s	401.9	 And ready, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=403.7s	403.7	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=404.9s	404.9	 In the air. Boy, he's clearing you like it's nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=407.5s	407.5	 He could do this all day. Look at him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=409.7s	409.7	 Just over and over. What do you call this trick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=411.9s	411.9	 Over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=412.9s	412.9	 Nice and to the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=413.9s	413.9	 Sarah, how do you go about teaching something like arm overs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=417.3s	417.3	 So all you need is a wall, some treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=419.9s	419.9	 You're going to put your dog in a sit on one of your sides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=422.5s	422.5	 Doesn't really matter which side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=423.9s	423.9	 We're going to create a barricade so the dog can't go around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=426.4s	426.4	 and then place some treats on the other side of your arm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=428.7s	428.7	 and tell your dog to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=429.9s	429.9	 If your dog goes under your arm a lot, you can also opt to use your leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=434.3s	434.3	 And then once you've used your leg several times, you can use your arm again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=437.9s	437.9	 To phase out the wall, all you're going to do is start to put a gap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=441.3s	441.3	 between the wall and your arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=443.7s	443.7	 People just love it when dogs get off the ground, don't they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=446.1s	446.1	 They do a lot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=479.8s	479.8	 You can go from luring the dog straight up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9eTlFwJs4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=455&pp=iAQB&t=482.0s	482.0	 So like this, get it.
