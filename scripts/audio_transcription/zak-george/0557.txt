https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=187.5s	187.5	 Okay, I guess she wants me to hold her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 I'll just do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=190.3s	190.3	 That'll happen.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=206.7s	206.7	 Pretty much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 Brent, now how involved have you been with the training and tell me about what your experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=211.6s	211.6	 has been with Kaleifi so far.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=217.1s	217.1	 I can't look at her and not give her what she wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 As soon as she wants to bark and stuff like that, I just want to figure out what it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=222.5s	222.5	 and fix it for her.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=228.1s	228.1	 and fixing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=230.1s	230.1	 When I came over here the other night, she was really, really chatty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=232.9s	232.9	 So I understand what you're going through right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=235.3s	235.3	 I totally get this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=236.5s	236.5	 This is a very overwhelming thing because even though you might be able to get your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 dog to stop for a second, they just go right back into it and wonder, what am I doing wrong?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 I'm trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=245.5s	245.5	 So hopefully we can clear up some of that confusion today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=247.9s	247.9	 It's really important that you understand why your individual dog is barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=251.3s	251.3	 In Kaliope's case, she's just simply barking because she wants to do stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=254.8s	254.8	 She's young, she's energetic, she wants to interact with the world and interact with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 people.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=260.9s	260.9	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 She brings a ball because she wants to interact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=263.2s	263.2	 I bet if I keep barking, she'll start barking because she's saying, I really want to play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=267.5s	267.5	 with that ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 What are you waiting on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 But we want to let her know you're only going to get this ball when you're quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 So we want to make sure that we time our rewards during moments of quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=276.3s	276.3	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 There was a brief moment of silence there, so I gave her the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=280.8s	280.8	 I'm going to elaborate more on that in a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=282.9s	282.9	 The reason that most dogs bark incessantly is because they're bored and not getting enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=288.0s	288.0	 mental and physical exercise.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 But you can still communicate to them that you don't want them to bark even when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=298.2s	298.2	 not exercised.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=300.9s	300.9	 But there are no real ways to guarantee that your dog is not going to bark when you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=304.3s	304.3	 not present.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=306.5s	306.5	 It is vital to make sure that you set up training scenarios when you are at home so that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=311.3s	311.3	 can communicate to your dog how you want them to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=314.1s	314.1	 Today we're going to do three different exercises, I hope, that will communicate to her that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=320.3s	320.3	 Now correct me if I'm wrong, but when you initiate training, like basic obedience training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=325.2s	325.2	 does she immediately start going into barking mode?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=327.6s	327.6	 She'll bark if we don't give her the reward immediately.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=332.7s	332.7	 She's very good at remembering that she deserves a treat after she does a trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=336.8s	336.8	 We'll start to get a handle on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=338.3s	338.3	 The next thing we'll do is we'll teach her how to not bark when someone knocks at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=341.5s	341.5	 door, at least how to not bark excessively when someone knocks at the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 And finally, we'll teach her how to be quiet while she relaxes in her crate because she

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=369.3s	369.3	 well, you'll know what I'm talking about.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=382.4s	382.4	 Once you've done that, then you'll be able to reassure them if they're nervous or guide

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A9SpCdRZg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=415.9s	415.9	 Every time I say no, I'm going to make sure I don't give her a reward, letting her know
