Even though potty training can take a fair amount of time to accomplish, you can get pretty serious results in that first month, especially if you seek out advice on modern methods from professional trainers, just like you're doing right now. A study in the journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that pet parents who were counseled to house train their dogs by focusing on preventing potty accidents and avoiding using verbal punishment when accidents occurred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIqggdtdKl4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=469&pp=iAQB&t=159.8s	159.8	 had significantly better potty training results over the first month of house training. And these pet parents also used enzymatic cleaners to clean up potty accidents. And that can be a big help too. So what about excitement or submissive urination? That's where your dog involuntarily peas when they get really excited or really nervous. Most dogs outgrow this by the time they're a couple of years old. In the meantime, do your best to have your dog relieve themselves before they're in a situation that's likely to make them nervous or excited. Exposing your dog to lots of new people and situations should minimize these types of accidents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIqggdtdKl4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=469&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 Over time, because these experiences become more normal to your dog, it's really easy to trigger potty training relapses too. For example, if you move or if you're at a friend's house, or if you ease up a little bit too early on your consistency. Now, if this is you be prepared to take a step back on your house training so you can help ease your dog through these changes. If you notice that your dog is having potty accidents and there have been no major changes to their life or their environment, get them to a vet to rule out any health issues which are quite common. I don't recommend letting your guard down at all for at least
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIqggdtdKl4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=469&pp=iAQB&t=219.8s	219.8	 a year if you've got a young puppy like this and maybe six months or so if you've got an older dog. Would you trust this face? So remember, the ultimate secret to potty training your dog is understanding that it can take many months to fully accomplish, but it's really not that hard as long as you're super consistent.
