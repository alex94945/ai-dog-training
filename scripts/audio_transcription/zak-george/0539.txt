https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 So your dog listens well at home, maybe even in the backyard, but when you go in public or take the leash off, forget it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=6.1s	6.1	 Sound familiar?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=7.1s	7.1	 Today I'm going to show you the formula to teach your dog how to listen to you everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=15.9s	15.9	 Today's video is sponsored by PetFlow.com slash Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 If you have a high energy dog like Jacob, it's vital that you exercise them before expecting them to listen to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 in an unfamiliar place or if you're about to teach them something new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=29.2s	29.2	 You guys often ask me what kind of food is best for your dog and of course that really depends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 Now a high energy dog like Jacob needs a real high calorie food because he's really active.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 Regardless of which food you get, you should get it from PetFlow.com slash Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=43.5s	43.5	 The miracle of PetFlow is that...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 Jacob, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 The miracle of PetFlow is that your dog's food is always there when you need it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 You just choose the brand that you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=53.3s	53.3	 They have hundreds of brands, even prescription foods, and how often you want your food delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 Good job buddy, you're looking good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 Come on Jacob.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=61.4s	61.4	 Teach your dog with 21st century principles and let PetFlow's 21st century innovations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 bring your dog food to your front door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 Now I can assure you that you're going to like it, but if you don't, feel free to edit or cancel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 When you do set up automatic pet food delivery, just enter code ZACH20.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=76.2s	76.2	 You'll get 20% off of your first purchase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=78.9s	78.9	 Now you might have noticed that I have Jacob on a really long lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=82.2s	82.2	 You'll recall the fastest way to throw a dog off and to confuse them is to change their environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 or surroundings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 So I want to make sure that I have control of him, even though we have a fenced area here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=92.3s	92.3	 I love double controlled environments the best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 But I don't want to get cocky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=95.9s	95.9	 I mean, what if a squirrel runs out or something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 I want to make sure that I'm one step ahead of him at all times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 Buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=104.5s	104.5	 Let's go back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=111.6s	111.6	 Jacob, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=112.3s	112.3	 So right now, I mean you can see he's not listening to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=115.1s	115.1	 I'm asking him to come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=116.3s	116.3	 If I were to let go of this leash, he would go straight over there and he wouldn't listen to me at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=119.9s	119.9	 Worse yet, he would have that association of not listening to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 When using a long lead, this one's about 25 feet or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 Do use caution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=127.2s	127.2	 Make sure you don't get tripped up on it or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=129.8s	129.8	 You'll also notice we have a harness on Jacob.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 That's a bit of a safer option as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 Make sure you have your dog's favorite currencies available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=136.4s	136.4	 Jacob's currencies are, of course, frisbee and also food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=140.1s	140.1	 Before even considering asking your dog to listen to you in a new, exciting environment like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=145.5s	145.5	 or before you introduce new concepts to them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 make sure that they're very solid on their basics in a home environment first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 For those of you with puppies, especially under the age of five months or so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 don't make the mistake of thinking that just because they stay near you off leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 that they're just pretty reliable off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=160.8s	160.8	 That's very normal for young dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=162.9s	162.9	 So keep them on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 In the beginning, be prepared for intermittent compliance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=167.1s	167.1	 because, of course, your dog's very excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=170.3s	170.3	 Don't be discouraged if they don't listen to you as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=172.5s	172.5	 See, the trick to teaching your dog to listen to you in an unfamiliar place like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 is to simulate an uncontrolled environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 Don't be tempted to take the lead off during the preliminary phases of teaching your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 how to listen to you off leash, even in a fenced area,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 because this is a big area out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 If Jacob were to bolt after a small animal, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=194.5s	194.5	 I wouldn't have much way to get to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=196.1s	196.1	 If you are one of those people out there who has taken the lead off your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=199.2s	199.2	 and they have repeatedly experienced getting away from you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=202.8s	202.8	 then just simply take a step back on your training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=205.1s	205.1	 put the lead back on your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=206.9s	206.9	 Taking a step back on your training is completely normal, expected,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=210.3s	210.3	 and required during the first several months of teaching your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=213.3s	213.3	 Now that Jacob's energy is out and he's become acclimated to the area and smelled around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=217.7s	217.7	 he's starting to get used to it out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=219.3s	219.3	 Our next step is to go over the basics that Jacob already knows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=222.6s	222.6	 For example, things he does flawlessly at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 Now, I'm going to be using tiny pieces of real meat today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=228.1s	228.1	 I'm just going to give him one to warm him up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=229.8s	229.8	 How about lie down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 Hey, this is looking really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=233.3s	233.3	 Now, if I had tried this before exercising, you know, he wouldn't be quite as reliable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 I'll take a play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 I'm going to try and keep things really easy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=242.0s	242.0	 and I'm going to reinforce by giving him lots of good treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=244.6s	244.6	 and authentic encouragement along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=247.3s	247.3	 Good. Nice work, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 It's important to change as few variables as possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=252.5s	252.5	 when you're introducing new concepts to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 In this case, even though we're not going over any type of new training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=257.6s	257.6	 I've changed his environment dramatically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 You're so smart. You're doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=262.8s	262.8	 Now, I'm going to up the level of difficulty a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=264.9s	264.9	 and I'm going to ask him to do his basics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=266.4s	266.4	 with a little bit of distance like he does at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=268.7s	268.7	 Jacob, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=270.9s	270.9	 He snuck up a little bit on me there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=272.1s	272.1	 I'm going to let him get by with it, though,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=273.3s	273.3	 because remember, I want to be kind of liberal with my rewards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=276.2s	276.2	 because I'm asking him to do it in this strange, exciting place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=279.1s	279.1	 Jacob, look at me. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=282.3s	282.3	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=284.6s	284.6	 Yes. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGL92O5tB_M&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=286.8s	286.8	 I'm rewarding for each individual thing,
