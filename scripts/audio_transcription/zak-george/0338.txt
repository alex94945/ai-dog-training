https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=4.6s	4.6	 As you know, a presidential race is underway and Inconvenient Man has decided to jump in the race.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=10.5s	10.5	 Go ahead, Inconvenient Man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=12.1s	12.1	 Progress is happening everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=14.4s	14.4	 This is terrible!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 For example, I know many viewers of this very YouTube channel are having their dog's food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 automatically shipped to them from PepFlo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=23.1s	23.1	 Which means that they're also skipping traffic and waiting in lines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 But don't you see?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=27.8s	27.8	 Waiting in lines and traffic is what this country was built on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 That's why my campaign slogan is

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=36.6s	36.6	 I'm calling for the restoration of doing things the old fashioned way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=45.7s	45.7	 So don't go to PepFlo.com slash Zach George

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 I'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 Let's go inside and see what we can find.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=85.5s	85.5	 Bigfoot is one of my favorite kind of shelter dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=87.6s	87.6	 He's a senior dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=88.7s	88.7	 Bigfoot's nine years old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 He spent the last year of his life living at the animal shelter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 Bigfoot was relinquished because his last family just didn't want him anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=96.7s	96.7	 And training and teaching a dog how to be more social and listen better can go a long way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=101.4s	101.4	 towards making them more adoptable and giving them the better life that they deserve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=104.8s	104.8	 There are a lot of pros to getting an older dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=106.7s	106.7	 Oftentimes when you adopt an older dog, you don't have to deal with as many of the common puppy problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=111.5s	111.5	 and they're older and more settled and more mature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 That doesn't mean they don't need training necessarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 When you think about the environment of many shelters, it can be a potentially stressful environment for many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=121.3s	121.3	 So I like to take that into account before I just start jumping into training a dog and being very mindful of the fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=127.2s	127.2	 that just moments ago that Bigfoot was in a shelter environment around lots of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 Nothing can quite compare to being out here with one person getting that one on one time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=137.2s	137.2	 So we're going to give him some time to adjust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=138.8s	138.8	 I'm putting a long lead now on Bigfoot just to give him a little bit of a greater area to roam around and check everything out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=144.8s	144.8	 Let's go see what's over here, Bigfoot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=146.2s	146.2	 It's really important for dogs to get comfortable with and take in their new environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=150.6s	150.6	 They've got to appreciate all those smells and sights and the wind and all of those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=155.7s	155.7	 Those all affect your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=157.4s	157.4	 And if they're too focused on those things, then it's hard to connect with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=161.1s	161.1	 So better to let them get it out of their system and just take it all in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=164.5s	164.5	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 Let's see. Oh, look at that, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 All right. So that's an encouraging sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 As far as I know, Bigfoot's never been here before and he's playing with a tug toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 What's the significance of getting him to play with a toy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=175.2s	175.2	 Well, his mindset appears to be pretty happy and optimistic and excited right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 He's focused on me because I've got the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 Those are two really important things when you're training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=185.1s	185.1	 I'm going to make the toy boring and see if he lets go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=189.9s	189.9	 Yes, drop it. Kind of an accidental let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=192.4s	192.4	 But notice I'm going to give him the toy right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=194.2s	194.2	 So we've done a little bit of playing with Bigfoot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 We've let him explore a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=197.8s	197.8	 I think it's time to see what he can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=199.5s	199.5	 I'm getting him to take a treat from me, let him know, look, I'm good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=202.9s	202.9	 I give you good stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 Does he know a sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 Not a bad start. I love it. Sit. How about it down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=209.7s	209.7	 Oh, good job, buddy. That's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=212.2s	212.2	 Now, let's see what happens if I say down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 See, he's confused when I point to the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 If I lure him, that's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=218.6s	218.6	 But look, I got to bend over here and hunch down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=221.3s	221.3	 Maybe I don't want to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 So let's see if we can teach Bigfoot to lie down while I stand up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=225.6s	225.6	 The way to do that, rather than just luring him like I did,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=228.4s	228.4	 I'm going to do like a half lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=229.7s	229.7	 I'm not going to go down quite as far down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 Very good. So that way I was only down halfway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=234.3s	234.3	 and we'll bring him into an up just by luring him there. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=237.5s	237.5	 Do you see the difference, though, from here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 Listens very readily when I do it just like that as compared to down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=243.4s	243.4	 See that completely different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 We're only a couple of inches away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 That's how nuanced your communication can be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 I'd like to see if we can improve on that real quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=251.8s	251.8	 He's a sharp dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=252.7s	252.7	 You can see just working through that a little bit with them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=255.2s	255.2	 going a couple of times, showing them exactly what you mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=257.8s	257.8	 It's a good way to improve communication and broaden their view of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=261.1s	261.1	 And by that, I mean, if you can really get your dog to focus on you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=264.5s	264.5	 in a variety of different contexts, it really helps to broaden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=266.9s	266.9	 your communication with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 Let's work on stay now and see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=270.5s	270.5	 Let me give him a hand signal with stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 see if we can get him to stay for five seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=274.2s	274.2	 Stay one, two, three, four, five. Works for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 Let's see what happens when I walk away, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=280.1s	280.1	 Stay. OK, come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=283.5s	283.5	 Get over here and look, come when called.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=285.4s	285.4	 He's really a smart boy. He's doing so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=287.9s	287.9	 It's really important that our dogs know how to stay and how to come when we call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 I think as long as his new family continues to work with him on his basic obedience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 that should be looking good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 But I did notice that before he was pulling on the leash quite a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=300.4s	300.4	 I'm going to switch back to a regular leash and let's see how he does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 on his leash walking skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=304.7s	304.7	 Leash skills are incredibly important for dogs, especially a big, strong dog like Bigfoot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=309.4s	309.4	 You want him to be very obedient on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 So I've got his currency. I'm using good treats today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 The way I like to start a leash training session is really just by going back and forth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=318.0s	318.0	 and rewarding liberally when he pays attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=320.4s	320.4	 And so you can see there every time he's pulling ahead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=323.1s	323.1	 I'm just encouraging him to come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=325.1s	325.1	 And part of the reason he's doing so well is because he's been out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 We've been doing training. He's gotten a little bit of exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=330.9s	330.9	 That sometimes is all you need to get a compliant dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=334.3s	334.3	 Bigfoot is a perfect example of how shelter dogs can be just fantastic dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=338.8s	338.8	 I mean, straight out of the shelter. He's been there a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=341.2s	341.2	 His other family didn't want him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzq3bnOJQA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=339&pp=iAQB&t=342.7s	342.7	 I've spent, what, an hour with him and he's doing fantastic on his training.
