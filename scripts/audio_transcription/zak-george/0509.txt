https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwgoAH2SVuQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=17.7s	17.7	 New Orleans, where I am, has actually been quite lucky in that we haven't had much flooding,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwgoAH2SVuQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 but our shelters have been stressed by the surge in homeless dogs from surrounding areas.
