https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=8.7s	8.7	 little bit different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=9.7s	9.7	 So this class coming in right now, it is the strangest anomaly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 Every single dog in here is no bigger than this, and it's a full class too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=18.1s	18.1	 So there's this little dog whose name is Little Dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=22.6s	22.6	 One of the things we're focusing on is just getting her more comfortable in the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=27.2s	27.2	 One thing you can do to help a dog feel a little more comfortable is to introduce them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 to other dogs and other people in a pretty low-key setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=35.3s	35.3	 Be very understanding and patient with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 If a dog is stressed a little too much, it's not really realistic or fair to ask them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=42.8s	42.8	 do new obedience commands or introduce those concepts to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 Right here I'd celebrate that waggin tail over not laying down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=50.4s	50.4	 The fact that she is more comfortable in the environment is more worth celebrating rather
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=54.3s	54.3	 than throwing a lie down on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=56.2s	56.2	 If you can find those brief moments where they're basically saying, you know what, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 feeling a little bit better, then we really want to seize those moments to at least encourage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 them to do something new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 They haven't been able to get down, so the first time your dog does something that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 love, you've got to let them know you love it in the most genuine, appreciative way possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=72.9s	72.9	 It has to come from your heart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=75.1s	75.1	 Just a little bit of patience in dog training goes a really long way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=79.4s	79.4	 Today I really want to focus on teaching our dogs to check in with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 I like to teach a dog how to not fall on a leash in several steps, but that first step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 is just encouraging them to check in with you and to change directions often so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=93.9s	93.9	 they don't know where the walk is going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=95.3s	95.3	 What that says to them is, look, I'm leading the walk, pay attention to me, and you'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=98.9s	98.9	 get to walk all day long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=100.3s	100.3	 Jared and little dog are working together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=102.4s	102.4	 You're very understanding with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 I like that a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 You're not rushing her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=106.6s	106.6	 I can see that authentic, genuine connection with you right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=109.1s	109.1	 That's what I look for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=110.1s	110.1	 And let little dog know that you like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=112.1s	112.1	 Having our dogs come to us when we call them is a mega important skill for our dogs to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 know and understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 Breeze, come now!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=126.6s	126.6	 Because of the importance of Come When Called, we want to do everything we can to make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=131.5s	131.5	 that they know that Come When Called equals wonderful things.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 It's not just a handful of turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=139.9s	139.9	 We always call them in that enthusiastic voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=142.5s	142.5	 Being low to the ground, if you're able to get low, is always a good thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 To really get that eye contact nice and solid with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 Breeze, Breeze, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=149.8s	149.8	 Come here, Breeze.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=160.8s	160.8	 It's very important that we have our dogs in a completely controlled environment for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=165.4s	165.4	 their first year of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 Supervision is ideal when you're in a position to supervise them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 However, when you can't supervise them, you should simply have them in a crate or a room

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDk61XaJMpk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=630&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 Dogs are not born knowing to come back to us immediately.
