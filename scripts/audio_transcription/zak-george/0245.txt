https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This is Kona's third day with me and it's time to attempt some actual training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=4.5s	4.5	 At least, I hope so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=6.5s	6.5	 I'm Zach George. I'm a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 Meet my new project, Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=10.5s	10.5	 I've got just three weeks to train her and set her up for the most well-behaved life possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 That means I need to work on the most common puppy issues like potty training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 how to actually pay attention, stopping things like play biting, chewing, separation anxiety,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=23.2s	23.2	 getting along with other animals, leash walking and teaching her everything a good dog needs to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 Real dog training doesn't always go smoothly and that's why I'm going to show you every success and mistake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 and how I work through all the most challenging parts of raising a new puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 Welcome to your new puppy survival guide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=42.5s	42.5	 Guys, it has been three days now that we've had Kona and I think she's finally really adjusting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=47.9s	47.9	 I mean, I think it's fair to give a dog a few days to adjust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 I think it's about time that we get started on Kona's obedience training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=53.7s	53.7	 Today, we're going to go over some of the most fundamental things that every person and every puppy should know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 Puppies are growing so fast and a lot of you might not realize this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=62.1s	62.1	 but puppies need a very specific type of puppy food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=65.5s	65.5	 Needless to say, this is not the time to experiment with homemade diets at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 That said, you still want to give your puppy premium ingredients in their food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=73.9s	73.9	 The nutritional science behind this solid gold dog food is extremely impressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=79.4s	79.4	 Anytime you're looking at a food, look at the ingredients.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=81.5s	81.5	 They list them from most abundant to least abundant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 So the first three ingredients on this one are bison, ocean fish and brown rice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 Okay, let's see what Kona thinks of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 I promise we've been feeding her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=96.7s	96.7	 Okay, Kona definitely loves solid gold food and solid gold has a whole line of high-end foods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=101.7s	101.7	 and supplements for your dog like bone broth and these sea meal supplements are great for their coat and their overall health.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=107.2s	107.2	 Save 30% on select solid gold products by going to my special link, solidgoldpet.com slash Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 That link will be in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=115.9s	115.9	 Kona has had three days with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=118.4s	118.4	 By design, I've just been really letting the focus of our efforts be on getting her to adjust,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 getting her comfortable with inertia and Indy and this new environment and me and Bree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=127.4s	127.4	 But I think it's about time, since I only have three weeks with her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 to really get started on some of her core obedience that every dog really needs to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=136.7s	136.7	 I mean, if you think about it, one of the fundamental things that our dogs have to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=140.1s	140.1	 are the difference between yes and no or this is okay and that's not okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=145.5s	145.5	 Now, I do want to say before we get into that particular part of the lesson,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 that you'll find that you'll get much better results and training will be much more enjoyable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=153.1s	153.1	 if you let the emphasis of your training be on yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 I think one of the best ways for a dog to learn the difference between yes and no is by teaching them how to leave something alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 But by the end of this lesson, Kona will know how to leave a real piece of chicken alone when we drop it in front of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=171.1s	171.1	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=172.4s	172.4	 Let's make sure she doesn't know that so you know that she's learning this for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=176.5s	176.5	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=178.9s	178.9	 So we clearly have some work to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 I'm going to start this training by just using a dog treat to make it a little bit easier for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=184.9s	184.9	 And we're going to work up to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=186.2s	186.2	 You'll find that it's a really powerful thing when you can get your dog to do something organically from the inside out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=192.3s	192.3	 Ouch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=193.5s	193.5	 Ouch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=196.2s	196.2	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=196.9s	196.9	 Look how hard she's biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=197.8s	197.8	 You see those little pinpricks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=199.3s	199.3	 That hurts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=200.5s	200.5	 I'm letting her know the treat is there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 I'm going to close my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=203.2s	203.2	 Now the second she turns her head away, I'm going to go ahead and give her the treat to let her know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=206.8s	206.8	 I like that even if it's by accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=208.8s	208.8	 So here's the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=214.6s	214.6	 Every time I say the word yes, I really want to provide a positive outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=220.1s	220.1	 When she goes for it, I close my hand because she doesn't have permission to get that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=223.6s	223.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=224.5s	224.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 I'm going to run through this a few times until I feel like she's getting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=230.6s	230.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=231.9s	231.9	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=232.4s	232.4	 I mean, you can see her brainstorming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=233.9s	233.9	 She's like maybe when I don't try he'll give it to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=236.7s	236.7	 So she's a real smart girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=237.9s	237.9	 You can see how she's really starting to pick this up quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=242.1s	242.1	 So now look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 I'm not even going to close my hand this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=256.7s	256.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=257.9s	257.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=258.9s	258.9	 Really good job there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=259.7s	259.7	 You can see the wheels are turning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=261.4s	261.4	 She's demonstrating that she's understanding the concept, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=266.5s	266.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=267.6s	267.6	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=268.9s	268.9	 So now let me put a little closer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=271.9s	271.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=277.7s	277.7	 So you'll see how I'll gently say no when she goes for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=280.9s	280.9	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=281.4s	281.4	 No should never come from a place of frustration when you're training your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=285.3s	285.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=286.5s	286.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=287.4s	287.4	 Now I think we can start introducing the basic word to her of leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=291.1s	291.1	 She's not necessarily going to absorb what the term leave it means in one lesson,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 but you got to start somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 So leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=298.6s	298.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=302.4s	302.4	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=303.9s	303.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=305.8s	305.8	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=306.7s	306.7	 I'm just using some soft dog treats today and I'm breaking them up into little pieces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=310.8s	310.8	 so I can get lots of extra use out of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=315.5s	315.5	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=322.5s	322.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=324.3s	324.3	 So so far pretty good, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=325.9s	325.9	 Now let's make this a little bit more challenging for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=328.7s	328.7	 Let's see if we can give it motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=330.6s	330.6	 You might know that things that move really get our dog's attention a lot more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=335.6s	335.6	 So as demonstrated by the toy, the same is true with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=340.0s	340.0	 Notice even if I say leave it and I drop it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=343.7s	343.7	 she's almost certainly going to go for it because we changed a variable there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 We made it move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=348.8s	348.8	 We're not just holding it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=349.7s	349.7	 That's harder for a dog to lay off something that's moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=352.5s	352.5	 I'm going to have it move a little bit less this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=355.5s	355.5	 And when she goes for it, I'm going to cover it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=357.1s	357.1	 We haven't had to say no too much here and that's how it should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=360.1s	360.1	 You want the emphasis of your training to be on the word yes on what your dog is doing, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=364.4s	364.4	 This isn't a magic trick about teaching your dog how to leave a treat alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=368.2s	368.2	 This is showing them the basics of impulse control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=371.0s	371.0	 So the treat is just a metaphor for the squirrel, for the dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=375.1s	375.1	 for other things that cause them to get excited in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=378.0s	378.0	 You know, teaching them how to leave something alone that they want to go after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=381.8s	381.8	 is a really basic concept that every dog needs to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=385.5s	385.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=386.3s	386.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=386.7s	386.7	 So a lot more restraint that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=388.3s	388.3	 Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=389.4s	389.4	 You can see her getting it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=390.8s	390.8	 When you look at her body language and her eyes, you can see she's really trying to process it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=394.8s	394.8	 It's a beautiful thing to watch a dog learn something new like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=398.3s	398.3	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=399.5s	399.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=400.3s	400.3	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=402.3s	402.3	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=404.4s	404.4	 See, it's hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=405.1s	405.1	 It's like, why would I leave it alone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=406.5s	406.5	 It's right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=408.6s	408.6	 This is a really fundamental thing when it comes to establishing communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=415.3s	415.3	 Now I'm adding time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=416.5s	416.5	 I'm asking her to leave it alone for a period of time here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=419.5s	419.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=420.6s	420.6	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=421.5s	421.5	 Let's go ahead and up the ante a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 Let's see if we can make this a little bit more challenging for her just so that she really gets it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=427.7s	427.7	 I've got a piece of chicken breast that I use for training right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=430.9s	430.9	 So since this is dramatically better tasting to her, I'm going to start from square one again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=435.3s	435.3	 So changing a variable this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=437.3s	437.3	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=438.2s	438.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=439.1s	439.1	 This is probably her first time I would guess of ever having real chicken as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=443.3s	443.3	 So she's going to like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=444.9s	444.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=447.6s	447.6	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=449.1s	449.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=449.7s	449.7	 Look how quick she's learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=450.8s	450.8	 I mean, we've been doing this minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=453.1s	453.1	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=458.3s	458.3	 I can't emphasize how important this is for your long-term training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=462.9s	462.9	 So take your time on this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=464.3s	464.3	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=466.3s	466.3	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=467.3s	467.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=468.6s	468.6	 So I'm going to go ahead and give her a treat from over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=471.0s	471.0	 I think it's a little bit more clear if you give them the treat than if they get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=474.5s	474.5	 reinforced from picking up the stuff you don't want off the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=477.6s	477.6	 I told you by the end of this lesson can teach any dog to leave something alone without force.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=482.2s	482.2	 And I really do mean every dog in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=485.4s	485.4	 I mean, I remember in some cases when I would teach classes and I would do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=489.2s	489.2	 It could take up to seven, eight, sometimes ten minutes maybe with some really tough dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=493.8s	493.8	 But I mean, what's ten minutes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=495.0s	495.0	 Most dogs learn this within just a minute or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=497.5s	497.5	 So it's a really exciting thing to teach a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=499.9s	499.9	 Now, I want to emphasize don't get too excited or too cocky here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=504.1s	504.1	 Just because your dog will leave a piece of meat alone when you drop it in front of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=507.5s	507.5	 does not mean they have generalized leave some garbage alone on a walk or leave my dinner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=512.0s	512.0	 alone when I set it on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=513.8s	513.8	 So it still takes a lot of training in those specific contexts to really teach a dog how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=519.2s	519.2	 to understand this concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=520.6s	520.6	 But this is where you start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=522.0s	522.0	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=523.1s	523.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=524.2s	524.2	 And for those of you with a new dog, get both of my books.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=527.3s	527.3	 They're really going to be a great reference guide and they go along with my YouTube videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=531.6s	531.6	 really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=532.6s	532.6	 I'll have a link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=534.0s	534.0	 Potty training with Kona has been going pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=538.5s	538.5	 I do have to admit she's had a couple of accidents so far and both of those are absolutely my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=543.3s	543.3	 fault for letting her run around this immediate area while I was checking an email or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=547.7s	547.7	 So I'm going to get better with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=549.3s	549.3	 Just being honest with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=550.5s	550.5	 I thought something that might help would be to have these WizSmart pads by the door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=555.3s	555.3	 so that she's like really conditioned to at least start going towards an exit when she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=559.4s	559.4	 feels the need to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=560.8s	560.8	 On her first night, these pads came in really handy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=563.7s	563.7	 She actually pooped on one which was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=566.2s	566.2	 If you live in a high-rise building where it's difficult to go outside or if you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=569.2s	569.2	 want your dog to be able to use a pad when you travel or when the weather is bad, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=572.9s	572.9	 just gives you options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=574.2s	574.2	 One of my favorite features.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=575.3s	575.3	 You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=576.0s	576.0	 The stay put tabs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=577.2s	577.2	 One of the reasons that they're so absorbent is because they're made from recycled baby
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=582.0s	582.0	 diapers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=583.3s	583.3	 Unused baby diapers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=592.5s	592.5	 So now we're going to teach Kona how to look at me when I ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=596.7s	596.7	 Look at me is really important because it's really your dog just demonstrating that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=600.6s	600.6	 paying attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=602.0s	602.0	 So if you can't get your dog's eyes on you in a certain situation, that means you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=605.6s	605.6	 really have their attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=607.1s	607.1	 We can start off a couple of ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=608.3s	608.3	 So I could do something like yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=611.6s	611.6	 Once I had eye contact there, I said yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=613.7s	613.7	 So you have any eyes in there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=620.0s	620.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=621.0s	621.0	 So I really want her looking to my eyes because I'm going to be able to more easily communicate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=625.3s	625.3	 with her when she's looking at my face and I'll be able to read her better as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=630.1s	630.1	 So it's a really good thing to teach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=632.1s	632.1	 Now if your dog is less responsive, another thing you can do is just hold up a tree to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=635.5s	635.5	 your eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=636.5s	636.5	 See that?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=646.3s	646.3	 it because I like to phase in hold up a treat to look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=653.3s	653.3	 Yes to that hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=655.3s	655.3	 Once you get them looking at a treat, you can really easily phase in the hand signal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=658.6s	658.6	 pointing to your eyes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=662.2s	662.2	 It's really a lot easier to communicate with a dog, especially a new dog when you're close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=667.7s	667.7	 to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=668.0s	668.0	 Look at the distance between our eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=670.1s	670.1	 It's, you know, just a little over a foot right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=673.1s	673.1	 Here look at me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=691.1s	691.1	 training sessions for her to really grasp that concept, but do be very deliberate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=695.0s	695.0	 when you use the term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=696.2s	696.2	 In other words, wait till you really have a committed look at me before saying it just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=701.2s	701.2	 so she can really start to internalize what that request means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=704.8s	704.8	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=705.6s	705.6	 Using a high-pitched voice like that can be helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=710.6s	710.6	 Duration matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=711.5s	711.5	 If you can start getting increased focus and duration like that, that's always a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=715.1s	715.1	 thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=715.5s	715.5	 I'm using really small pieces of chicken by the way, really got her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=719.6s	719.6	 Look at me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=726.2s	726.2	 I got to look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=727.2s	727.2	 So I said, yes, after the second one, I'm following that up with a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=731.5s	731.5	 So this is the beginning of throwing in some random reinforcement here and there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=736.2s	736.2	 So sometimes, you know, cheating and stealing a look at me and getting two for the price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=739.8s	739.8	 of one is always nice when they're young.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=742.7s	742.7	 We've gone over look at me now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=745.2s	745.2	 What are my absolute favorite things to teach any dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=748.5s	748.5	 It's the first thing that you really teach your dog that just feels magical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=752.4s	752.4	 We're going to combine leave it and look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=754.5s	754.5	 I call this the leave it look at me combo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=757.9s	757.9	 I know very original title, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=760.2s	760.2	 We're going to distract her and then we're going to say look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=765.4s	765.4	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=767.1s	767.1	 Not only did she leave it, but I was able to get her attention on my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=771.3s	771.3	 Leave it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=846.5s	846.5	 If you're really patient and you go at your dog's pace, you'll find that their attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=850.4s	850.4	 span should go a pretty long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=853.4s	853.4	 The next thing I want to cover with you is something we call lure training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=857.0s	857.0	 Lure training is where you coax your dog into a specific physical position by getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=862.6s	862.6	 them to follow a treat with their nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=865.1s	865.1	 So we can actually teach a lot with lure training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=868.2s	868.2	 For example, right now I'm hoping to go over with Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=870.5s	870.5	 Sit, lie down, up, maybe stand and maybe even a trick or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=875.6s	875.6	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=876.1s	876.1	 Let's see what we can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=877.2s	877.2	 Make sure you're using a treat your dog likes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=879.4s	879.4	 I guess we'll stick with the chicken here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=881.5s	881.5	 Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=882.6s	882.6	 I'm going to make it difficult for her to get the whole thing and I'm comfortable with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=886.0s	886.0	 her nibbling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=886.6s	886.6	 I mean she does have sharp teeth, but let's see if we can lure her into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=891.1s	891.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=892.5s	892.5	 The second her butt hit the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=894.2s	894.2	 I said, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=895.4s	895.4	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=896.1s	896.1	 If you're comfortable with them nibbling like that, that's the way to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=898.9s	898.9	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=899.3s	899.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=901.1s	901.1	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=901.7s	901.7	 In other words, what a lot of people will do is they'll keep it a few inches from their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=905.2s	905.2	 dog's nose and that can work as you saw there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=907.9s	907.9	 But if you're really having trouble, you want them you want to keep it glued to their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=911.6s	911.6	 nose and go real slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=913.9s	913.9	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=915.2s	915.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=915.4s	915.4	 I'm releasing a little bit as she hits the desired position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=918.5s	918.5	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=919.1s	919.1	 It'll release the rest of it there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=920.9s	920.9	 Up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=923.0s	923.0	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=923.9s	923.9	 I mean you can see how simple it is how willing a dog is to follow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=927.4s	927.4	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=928.1s	928.1	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=929.6s	929.6	 You can call it up or you can call it sit in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=932.8s	932.8	 Sometimes I'll call it up because it is a different motion than sitting from this position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=940.0s	940.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=941.2s	941.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=941.9s	941.9	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=942.6s	942.6	 I really should just focus on yes right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=945.6s	945.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=949.2s	949.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=949.7s	949.7	 Now, let's see if we can get her to go into a stand on all fours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=953.5s	953.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=954.8s	954.8	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=956.2s	956.2	 So sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=958.3s	958.3	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=959.8s	959.8	 Up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=961.8s	961.8	 Stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=964.3s	964.3	 Pretty amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=965.3s	965.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=966.1s	966.1	 There's a whole art to luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=967.8s	967.8	 I mean you can get real notice how my wrist is twisting and turning trying to find that sweet spot for a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=973.1s	973.1	 particular trick can be a lot of fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=974.8s	974.8	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=975.6s	975.6	 It's kind of a precursor to a bow right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=978.0s	978.0	 So I'm choosing to reward her for following the lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=980.8s	980.8	 I'm trying to get those feet to go back into that bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=984.8s	984.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=985.6s	985.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=986.7s	986.7	 And I'm saying yes and pulling the treat away before she has a chance to go into a down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=991.2s	991.2	 Yes, because that's going to be the tendency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=993.4s	993.4	 If I just keep it there, she's going to plop into a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1000.4s	1000.4	 Like that and see that's where I've got to make sure I really focus on the timing of the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1006.3s	1006.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1007.1s	1007.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1007.7s	1007.7	 In other words, I'm happy to have her hit a quarter of a second bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1010.9s	1010.9	 As your dog begins to understand the concept, you'll start phasing out the lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1015.1s	1015.1	 You might do something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1016.6s	1016.6	 Sit so you can see how the lure gradually evolves into a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1021.0s	1021.0	 Eventually, you'll just be able to say sit down up stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1023.9s	1023.9	 It's important to kind of teach your dog both hand signals and actual words.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1028.2s	1028.2	 They both come in handy and different scenarios.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1030.6s	1030.6	 And so you might notice to since she's doing so well with this sometimes I'm rewarding after the third thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1035.4s	1035.4	 that she does because she's doing it so reliably now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1038.2s	1038.2	 She wasn't doing it as reliably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1039.8s	1039.8	 I'd be a little bit more liberal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1041.0s	1041.0	 So sit down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1043.4s	1043.4	 Yes, I got to sit and a down for a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1045.9s	1045.9	 This is the kind of thing that you'll do five minutes here five minutes there throughout the first few weeks of training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1050.7s	1050.7	 as your dog gets better and better with this you start increasing the distance at which you ask them to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1055.8s	1055.8	 So your goal after a few days of working on this might be to have your dog sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1061.7s	1061.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1063.4s	1063.4	 Have your dog sit while you stand up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1065.1s	1065.1	 Now, I think if I said lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1068.6s	1068.6	 She doesn't quite know what I mean there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1070.2s	1070.2	 But if I just take a step back and I do that down good, she knows so find where the communication is effective and kind of work at that range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1079.6s	1079.6	 So right there she's thinking about popping back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1081.6s	1081.6	 But if I do this she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1083.4s	1083.4	 Yes, that's the fine line in space that you've got to identify and build from there if that makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1088.6s	1088.6	 And then stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1092.5s	1092.5	 Yes, second she comes up into that stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1095.6s	1095.6	 I want to reward her there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1096.7s	1096.7	 Good job girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1098.0s	1098.0	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1099.8s	1099.8	 Yes, really good improvement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1103.0s	1103.0	 You can tell there's a puppy in the house because my shoes are untied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1107.2s	1107.2	 Lure training is a fantastic way to get your dog to start understanding physical positions that they'll need to be going into when you ask them to like sit lie down up and so forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1118.3s	1118.3	 Naturally, every single dog should know their name, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1121.9s	1121.9	 I mean for exactly this reason I've got to be able to get her attention easily off that rug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1126.3s	1126.3	 She's not allowed to chew on the rug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1127.9s	1127.9	 So I find that introducing a dog's name to them in a high-pitched voice can be very effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1133.2s	1133.2	 So let's try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1134.1s	1134.1	 Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1135.4s	1135.4	 Yes, see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1136.8s	1136.8	 See how she came right up to me when I said Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1139.6s	1139.6	 Now you can gradually phase in a more normal tone of voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1142.6s	1142.6	 But why would you want to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1144.0s	1144.0	 We've been training quite a while here and she's starting to wander.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1147.1s	1147.1	 Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1148.9s	1148.9	 Yes, so she starts to walk towards me there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1152.4s	1152.4	 I'm going to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1153.2s	1153.2	 I mean, this is the beginning of burning in a really good come when called or recall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1157.8s	1157.8	 But it really is that simple just pairing their name with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1160.7s	1160.7	 Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1162.0s	1162.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1165.2s	1165.2	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1169.0s	1169.0	 I'm going to let her attention drift again and give you one more example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1172.7s	1172.7	 Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1174.5s	1174.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1175.9s	1175.9	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1176.6s	1176.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1177.6s	1177.6	 So these are the things you should be working on first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1180.0s	1180.0	 You don't necessarily train these all in one day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1182.5s	1182.5	 If you really focus on refining the things we went over in this lesson, leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1186.5s	1186.5	 Look at me, their name, lure training, potty training, and giving them a great diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1191.8s	1191.8	 You should be very pleased with how quickly your dog learns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1195.5s	1195.5	 Just remember to be patient and always customize your particular training program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1199.5s	1199.5	 to your individual dog taking into account their particular strengths and weaknesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1204.9s	1204.9	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1205.3s	1205.3	 She's had plenty of training now and it's really important to balance play with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1209.3s	1209.3	 training for a young puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1210.7s	1210.7	 And you'll remember that Kona was initially pretty nervous of inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1214.7s	1214.7	 You can really start to see her come out of her shell now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1217.4s	1217.4	 It's so much fun to watch two dogs truly open up to one another for the very first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1222.5s	1222.5	 I think this looks like really good play right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1225.4s	1225.4	 Perfectly measured.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1226.6s	1226.6	 I'm really pleased with how inertia isn't playing too rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1229.7s	1229.7	 So yesterday Kona showed some glimmers of bravery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1232.7s	1232.7	 But during this play session, I feel like we caught the exact moment that Kona really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1237.2s	1237.2	 got confident with inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1238.7s	1238.7	 You can tell by her playful body language and her play bowels and just her overall behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1243.6s	1243.6	 I think one of the absolute best things you can do with a young puppy is to get them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1246.9s	1246.9	 interacting with other dogs in a way that both dogs feel comfortable with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1250.9s	1250.9	 Sometimes that means rambunctious play, but other dogs might want to just go and chill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1254.9s	1254.9	 out and take a nap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1255.9s	1255.9	 By really encouraging this kind of behavior now, we're improving the odds that they'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1259.8s	1259.8	 acquire really good social skills to use with other dogs in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1264.3s	1264.3	 At least that's the hope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1265.3s	1265.3	 This is so healthy for Kona as well to like get some experience with a really active dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1269.8s	1269.8	 like inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1270.8s	1270.8	 Play biting is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1272.6s	1272.6	 All right, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1273.6s	1273.6	 So this is night three with Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1276.3s	1276.3	 I'm going to stay down here at least one more night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1279.1s	1279.1	 She did really much better last night than the night before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1284.8s	1284.8	 So that's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1285.8s	1285.8	 Nonetheless, we're going to see how she does tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1287.3s	1287.3	 Still got the mattress set up down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1289.6s	1289.6	 Probably going to let these guys sleep upstairs so they're less distracting to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1294.5s	1294.5	 But she's doing really good in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1296.1s	1296.1	 So right off the bat, she is pretty relaxed straight away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1303.6s	1303.6	 Oh, what a girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1305.6s	1305.6	 Well, she did excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1309.3s	1309.3	 She's getting very comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1310.6s	1310.6	 We're going to take her outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1313.6s	1313.6	 The first thing I'll do in the morning is let her outside and then I'll let her run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1317.1s	1317.1	 around and play with inertia for a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1319.5s	1319.5	 Both dogs are really enjoying their play sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1322.2s	1322.2	 I'm so encouraged by this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1323.5s	1323.5	 This is something I'm going to continue to do every single day that I have Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1328.2s	1328.2	 Although I've got to be honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGbYT5zMRVk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=1329.2s	1329.2	 Right now it looks like my dog inertia is the only one getting any energy out here.
