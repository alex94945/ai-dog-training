https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G9hjb_8Vqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 He's reacting really well and I'm going to give it right back to him, letting him know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G9hjb_8Vqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=151.7s	151.7	 look, it's not going to go away forever.
