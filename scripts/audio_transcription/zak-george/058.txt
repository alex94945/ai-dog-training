https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=4.2s	4.2	 just being dominated by choke chain, prong collar, and electric collar trainers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 It's a hypothesis I've been playing with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=10.4s	10.4	 During COVID, everyone went out and got a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=12.5s	12.5	 And we all know that we didn't have that much notice that the world was going to shut down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 And at the beginning, we just thought it was going to be shut down for three months or

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 And people ran out and impulsively, it seems, got dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=24.7s	24.7	 And I think some of them were myopic or shortsighted and are facing behavior problems now because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=30.6s	30.6	 maybe they didn't put in the time it took to train the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 And they're looking for these desperate quick fix methods that are everywhere on social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 And that's what I think might be contributing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=41.1s	41.1	 It's an interesting hypothesis.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 Do you guys think there's any truth to that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 Because pre-COVID, it wasn't like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk44qRFtG4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=59&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 More people were willing to put in the time with their dogs.
