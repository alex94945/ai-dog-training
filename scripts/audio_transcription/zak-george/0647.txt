It's July 3rd today and in my city they just happen to do the big fireworks display the day before 4th of July because there's so much going on in metro Atlanta that they're like, you know, we know people are going to probably go everywhere else so if they want to get a jump on the 4th celebration then we'll just do it one day before.

That was so classic.

Happy birthday to you. Have you brought enough attention to the fact that we're on our way to an outdoor fireworks show? I guess not. Yeah, we're trying to watch the fireworks today on Venus's birthday. It's just raining too hard I think for the fireworks display.

They got their cooler. They got their drinks. It's still raining. We want to do something. We want to get out. So we're going to go eat the best pizza in Atlanta, which is Mellow Mushroom by far. Love it. It's good stuff, man.

It's a rainbow on Venus's birthday. I'm so happy. It's symbolic. I mean, look at all the weather signs we're seeing. The sun looks different. The rainbows are out. Like I'm telling you, it's a sign that Venus is just totally divine. I think she is. I mean, to me she is. To all of us, our dogs should be divine. Do you know what I mean? I think we all feel that way about our dogs, don't we? Don't you feel that way about Blue? I tell Blue every day, concentrate on being two. And he does that every day. I'm like, I'm going to be a dog. I'm going to be a dog. I'm going to be a dog. I'm going to be a dog. I'm going to be a dog. I'm going to be a dog. I'm going to be a dog. I'm going to be a dog.
