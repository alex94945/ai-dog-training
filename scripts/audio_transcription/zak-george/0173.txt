https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Think about this. Wouldn't it be great if you could have me, Zach George, the YouTube dog trainer, to watch your dog whenever you're not home?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=8.3s	8.3	 That's right. I have figured out a way to clone myself and put me inside of a device.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=14.6s	14.6	 I mean, don't get me wrong, there's still some stuff to work out with the megabytes or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Hang on, Furbo just emailed me. They're definitely gonna be into this idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 Oh. They're not interested in my clones?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 Apparently, Furbo already enhances your supervision powers so that you can take even better care of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=37.4s	37.4	 And you can stay connected with them even when you're not at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 What am I gonna do with all of these clones now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 I'll deal with them later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 The metaverse isn't such a bad place to be stuck in, is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=49.5s	49.5	 This is how it works. You just launch the Furbo app on your phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 You just tap this right here and it'll launch treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 Especially when I'm traveling or I'm away from home, I always want to know if my dog or any dog that I'm working with is barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=62.7s	62.7	 Because barking could be a sign of boredom, it could be a sign of anxiety, or a sign that you're about to get kicked out of your hotel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=69.2s	69.2	 Furbo's bark alerts don't just let you know when your dog is barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=72.8s	72.8	 They'll also tell you how long your dog's been barking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=75.9s	75.9	 And they'll even differentiate between barking and crying and howling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 Special dog trainer tip. All of those vocalizations can mean very different things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 You can see you can select all the barking shots, the continuous barking shots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 Check this out though. Look, the howling shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=91.2s	91.2	 Ahhhhhhh!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 Hear that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=93.4s	93.4	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=94.7s	94.7	 This has got to be the most incredible gift idea for anyone with a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 With Furbo's dog nanny service, Furbo will record video of any moments that trigger it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=103.9s	103.9	 And automatically create a 60 second highlight video at the end of every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 So you get to see the most important events of your dog's day even if you're too busy to check notifications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 Being able to identify how your dog behaves when you're not there can be huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 Even though there's general approaches to a lot of dog training problems, every single dog is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=125.5s	125.5	 You get this data and that's going to help you make a better plan moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=129.5s	129.5	 There's no way my clones could ever do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=134.1s	134.1	 Furbo's features are specifically designed to keep dogs safe when they're at home alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=138.4s	138.4	 If Furbo hears a smoke alarm or a carbon monoxide alarm going off, it will notify you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=143.5s	143.5	 Even if glass breaks, Furbo can hear that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=146.1s	146.1	 How do they do this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=147.2s	147.2	 And it doesn't just detect dogs, it can detect people as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=150.5s	150.5	 So if you're not expecting someone, that's pretty handy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 Or if you want to know when your dog sitter or relative has arrived, that's helpful too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 If your house is burning down, you'll know it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=160.4s	160.4	 If someone's trying to break in your house, you're going to get an alert on your phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=163.7s	163.7	 They're also working on dog emergency alerts which will notify you of potential medical emergencies with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 This is a crazy stat, but so far Furbo has saved over 2,800 dogs lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=175.7s	175.7	 And that's just as of right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=178.3s	178.3	 It's just supposed to help me train my dog and it...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=181.9s	181.9	 Wow!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 The craziest thing is that they're always updating the Furbo, which is how it continues to get so brilliant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 So literally the day you buy it is the least capable it will ever be because it only gets better with time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 This Black Friday, Furbo is having their biggest sale of all time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=200.1s	200.1	 You can say 53...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=202.7s	202.7	 Wait, that can't be right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=203.8s	203.8	 53%?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=204.7s	204.7	 Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfWboz3sdQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=215.7s	215.7	 You can get the Furbo at my special link.
