https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Pup Box is a monthly box that you get with all sorts of surprises and supplies for your dog based on their age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=6.4s	6.4	 Let's see what's in your Pup Box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=7.7s	7.7	 The first thing that every Pup Box comes with is a training guide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=11.9s	11.9	 It really kind of helps you focus on the most important things for your dog's age that particular month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=16.6s	16.6	 Pup Box isn't just about toys and treats either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=18.5s	18.5	 You get essentials like poop bags.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 This month we even got some puppy shampoo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=22.5s	22.5	 It's important to use like a really mild shampoo when you have a young dog so Pup Box understands that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 Oh, check this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=27.7s	27.7	 Look how innovative that toy is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=29.3s	29.3	 So you got a squeaky toy and it's also a tug toy and it's got a crinkly sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 So this has a lot of dimensions to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=35.5s	35.5	 Dogs love this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=36.4s	36.4	 Training a dog is about stimulating them mentally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 This is a fun puzzle toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 So you put treats inside of this and your dog plays with it to try to get the treats out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=43.3s	43.3	 Six-month-old dogs are still going through the teething phase too because they got brand new teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 So they really like that stimulation and the ever important training treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=51.3s	51.3	 We have to have that if we're going to train a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 Pup Box is going to give all of you 50% off of your first Pup Box when you sign up for a 3, 6 or 12 month subscription.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 I'll have a link below and get a copy of my newest book, Guide to a Well Behaved Dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=74.6s	74.6	 If you go through the simple steps that we're going to cover today, you can get phenomenal results with your dog in a very short period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=80.6s	80.6	 Let's find out how training with Linus is going from Sarah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 I'm Sarah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=83.7s	83.7	 This is Linus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 Linus is six months old now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 Last time we worked with Zach, Linus was teeny tiny and now he's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=91.5s	91.5	 Linus is amazing, but he jumps on the counter and steals food and we haven't really worked on stay a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 So I'd love to stop his counter surfing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=101.7s	101.7	 Zach, please help me train Linus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 Hey Sarah, welcome back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=107.3s	107.3	 She does it better than me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=108.2s	108.2	 Linus is so huge now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 I mean last time I saw him he was like this big and now he's giant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 I know you've been having issues with him jumping on the counter, stealing food, things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=116.4s	116.4	 Before you can expect your dog to stop doing that sort of thing, they need to know how to stay with basic distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 So I'd kind of like to walk you through that and see how much progress we can make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=125.4s	125.4	 You game?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=126.1s	126.1	 I'm game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=126.8s	126.8	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 So you know with training stay probably from watching the videos that we have to start small and kind of work him up to a more advanced stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 But I'm pretty confident we can get good results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 Why don't we start getting him warmed up with a two second stay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=137.9s	137.9	 Give him a good hand signal and tell him to stay and then release him after two seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=144.7s	144.7	 And be very clear with your hand signal when you tell him to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 It's a little confusing for him because this is sit, this is speak and this is stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=153.7s	153.7	 Even though those hand signals might be a little similar that should get worked out with time as long as you're consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 I think he's perfectly capable of differentiating between all of those hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 Okay, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 Ignore the jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=164.1s	164.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=165.2s	165.2	 Ignore the barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 I would go ahead and reward and then say okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=172.3s	172.3	 And so we kind of tell him okay, let him know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 All right, you're done staying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=174.9s	174.9	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=175.3s	175.3	 That's really common with young dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=176.7s	176.7	 They'll do all the things that they know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 They'll sit, they'll bark, they'll lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Just ignore the things that you're not asking for and that'll get worked out with time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=183.5s	183.5	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=184.9s	184.9	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=185.9s	185.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=187.1s	187.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=187.5s	187.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=187.9s	187.9	 Dogs really pick up on that genuine enthusiasm and love from us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 Linus was having a hard time on stay, but we broke it down and we made things a little bit easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=195.4s	195.4	 That's what I'm talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=196.5s	196.5	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=197.5s	197.5	 Yes, good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 I think we're ready to move on to the next step of stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=200.7s	200.7	 So stay for a short period of time is the easiest version of stay, but now it's time to add a little bit of difficulty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=206.8s	206.8	 So we're going to try stay while we walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=208.9s	208.9	 If I just say stay and I walk away, he almost immediately got up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=212.8s	212.8	 It's harder for dogs to stay when we walk away because they like being near us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=216.4s	216.4	 So watch this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=219.7s	219.7	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 Just my eyes went back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=224.5s	224.5	 See how I hustle back there and reward him instantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 Let him know, hey, I love what you're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=228.8s	228.8	 So right now you're not going to pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=230.2s	230.2	 Just take one step back and immediately get back to him and reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=233.4s	233.4	 Linus sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 Sit boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 Remember Linus, even though he's a big dog, he's only six months, barely six months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=240.2s	240.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=241.8s	241.8	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 No.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=252.4s	252.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=257.9s	257.9	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=258.5s	258.5	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=259.1s	259.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=260.2s	260.2	 And then yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=261.1s	261.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=264.3s	264.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=266.3s	266.3	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=267.9s	267.9	 Teaching your dog to stay for a period of time, being able to have them stay when you walk away a couple of steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 That's where you need to be before you start introducing distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 Our next step is to get Linus to stay when there's a really amazing treat in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=280.9s	280.9	 If your dog won't stay when you have a treat in front of them, well, you can't really expect them to stay under more distracting situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=285.9s	285.9	 Even though he looks like a grown-up dog, he's still very much a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=289.3s	289.3	 Impulse control is much tougher for younger dogs than it is older dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 So if I say stay, and then I throw it, obviously he's like, I'm not staying, I'm gonna go get that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=298.7s	298.7	 So our goal is to be able to drop that treat down in front of him and have him hold that stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=302.7s	302.7	 So let me see if we can get him to stay while I hold the treat in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=305.8s	305.8	 First of all, I'm going in slow motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=307.9s	307.9	 The moment he goes for that treat without permission, I'm immediately pulling it away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=313.7s	313.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=314.4s	314.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 So right now he's kind of holding that stay when I put the treat way up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=318.5s	318.5	 But I want to improve upon that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=320.1s	320.1	 The whole point of this is teaching him, hey, look, I know there's going to be stuff in life you want,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 but you can't just go for it because you feel like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=325.9s	325.9	 The reason we're on the ground like this is that it's easier for your dog to learn when you're closer to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 You want to lie down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=330.2s	330.2	 That seems to be working better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=331.4s	331.4	 See, I'm dropping it, letting him see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=333.2s	333.2	 He's like, oh, I can get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=334.3s	334.3	 No, you can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=334.9s	334.9	 And I'm waiting for him to show some voluntary restraint just on his own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=340.7s	340.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=341.3s	341.3	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=342.5s	342.5	 So that was a really good moment right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=344.1s	344.1	 And see, he's learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=344.7s	344.7	 Okay, if I listen, then I get what I want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=346.8s	346.8	 And that's how learning happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=348.6s	348.6	 He loves this toy so much that I think it would be a great way to show him how to use some self-control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=353.7s	353.7	 We're going to let him go into that down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=355.0s	355.0	 He's comfortable there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=355.8s	355.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=356.5s	356.5	 I'm going to start easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=357.6s	357.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=359.5s	359.5	 And you can see just by going through this training here, just take a few minutes to really let him understand it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=365.7s	365.7	 He starts to make dramatic progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=367.4s	367.4	 So Sarah, this is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=368.7s	368.7	 He'll stay under these controlled circumstances when we're really focused on him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=372.3s	372.3	 But I'd like to work up to something a little more real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=374.9s	374.9	 This is going to be a bit tougher because, you know, this is a new object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=377.5s	377.5	 Anytime we change a variable on our dog, it's going to be a bit tougher for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=381.2s	381.2	 Just because a dog will leave a treat alone doesn't mean they're going to generalize that into real life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 So we really want to methodically like walk them through every little thing that they're likely to encounter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=390.2s	390.2	 What I'm doing here is I'm just putting motion to it to make it a little extra tempting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=393.9s	393.9	 Do you see this kind of self-control he's getting just in this short period of time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=397.3s	397.3	 It was a little clunky there at first, but light bulb really seems to be going off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=400.4s	400.4	 Let's continue this training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=401.5s	401.5	 Let's see if we can make it even tougher for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=403.3s	403.3	 A turkey and bacon sandwich is probably a bit more tempting, wouldn't you say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 Whoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=408.4s	408.4	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=409.3s	409.3	 This one's going to be a bit tougher here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=410.9s	410.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=411.7s	411.7	 He like glanced at it and he looked right up at me as if to say, wait a minute, I'm seeing a pattern here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=416.4s	416.4	 I'm going to try and increase the distance because that adds complexity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=419.7s	419.7	 They're not dumb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=420.3s	420.3	 They know, hey, if you get too far away, I can probably get to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=423.1s	423.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=427.4s	427.4	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=428.4s	428.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=429.4s	429.4	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=430.2s	430.2	 Stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=436.5s	436.5	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=439.1s	439.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=443.4s	443.4	 I see you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=443.9s	443.9	 You're not getting that sandwich.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=445.8s	445.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=446.3s	446.3	 These are the kind of exercises that you need to do when you're just hanging out in the kitchen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=450.4s	450.4	 Take those extra moments to put something tempting in front of them like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=453.8s	453.8	 Really enforce stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=455.1s	455.1	 These are the very beginning steps that you need to take in order to teach your dog not to steal things off of the counter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWPwE4kDxew&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=460.2s	460.2	 Putbox is giving viewers of this video 50% off of their first Putbox when you sign up for a 3, 6, or 12 month subscription.
