https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today's video is brought to you by Midwest Homes for Pets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=5.9s	5.9	 One of the reasons that people relinquish their dogs or make their dogs live outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=9.1s	9.1	 is because they are difficult to potty train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=11.7s	11.7	 My hope is that you'll share this video with those that might need it because it's a pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 easy thing to overcome once you know what you're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=18.9s	18.9	 Also make sure you click thumbs up and make sure you're subscribed too because there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 a good chance you're probably a beginner if you're watching this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=25.7s	25.7	 I have lots of how-to videos on how to teach your dog the basics and even some more advanced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 In fact, check the description because I'll have a playlist on what to teach your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 in what order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 For those of you that have had a dog in the past, how long would you say that it took
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=38.4s	38.4	 you to house train your dog or are you still working on it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=41.9s	41.9	 What things worked for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 What things didn't work for you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=44.9s	44.9	 Tell me in the comments below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 Many people think there's something wrong with their dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 If they don't house train easily, they'll say things like, my dog is stubborn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 He just doesn't get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=53.3s	53.3	 Remember, we can't blame our dogs if they don't understand where they're supposed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 do their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 It's our responsibility to teach them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 It's very easy to get frustrated during the whole house training process as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=64.8s	64.8	 That's normal, but understand that frustration will hinder our progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=70.4s	70.4	 We have to reach deep and avoid that emotion during training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=73.9s	73.9	 Luna the Border Collie and I are going to show you how this is done, but we have to talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 about a few things first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=78.8s	78.8	 Be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 You cannot house train a dog in just a few days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 It's going to take a little bit of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 Understand that it's not instinctive for a dog to want to do their business outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 We have to show them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=90.1s	90.1	 Another very important thing to remember, potty accidents in the house are never punishable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=95.3s	95.3	 We wouldn't scold an infant for going in their diapers, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=98.9s	98.9	 Also avoid these longstanding myths and remedies like rubbing your dog's nose in their business
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=104.7s	104.7	 or spanking them or yelling at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=107.1s	107.1	 These are all very counterproductive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=108.7s	108.7	 They don't work, so just don't do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=110.8s	110.8	 The big picture with potty training is letting our dogs know that our house is their house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=116.7s	116.7	 Instinctively dogs don't like to do their business where they live and where they sleep,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=120.7s	120.7	 but they're not going to generalize the entire house as a single structure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=125.5s	125.5	 They might think to themselves, well, I live in the living room, but the dining room is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 right over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=129.9s	129.9	 I'll just do my business over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 You may have noticed if you're struggling with this that your dog may pick out one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=134.5s	134.5	 two, or three places within the house to regularly sneak off to, to do their thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=139.5s	139.5	 Once they understand that the whole house is indeed their house, you'll see the accidents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=143.4s	143.4	 come to a halt, but this will take a little bit of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=146.4s	146.4	 I'm going to show you exactly the best process to go through in order to accomplish this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=150.3s	150.3	 in the most reasonable amount of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=152.1s	152.1	 If you hear nothing else in this entire video, hear this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 Know that you need to become a master at controlling your dog's environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=162.2s	162.2	 In fact, this is an overall theme that you'll see time and time again as you continue to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=167.5s	167.5	 teach your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 So now is as good a time as any to get really good at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 The best way to control your dog's environment is to supervise them 100% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 Obviously that's impossible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=179.7s	179.7	 We have to sleep sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=180.9s	180.9	 We have to go to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=182.2s	182.2	 So there are other ways we can control our environment, but remember the number one mistake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 that people with new dogs make is too much freedom, too much trust, too early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=192.4s	192.4	 I encourage responsible and humane crate training for purposes of house training your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=197.7s	197.7	 If you succeed in making the crate a very fun and desirable place for your dog to be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 then you can expect to really accelerate the whole house training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=205.9s	205.9	 But one thing's very important to understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=207.5s	207.5	 The crate is not a babysitter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=209.2s	209.2	 We use the crate when we cannot directly supervise your dog because supervision is the most potent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=214.9s	214.9	 and effective way to teach our dogs all sorts of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 If you're supervising your dog appropriately and you catch them in the act of going, right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=222.9s	222.9	 as they're about to squat, for example, that is the time to interrupt their behavior and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=227.5s	227.5	 take them outside and encourage them to go in the right place, whereby you're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=231.3s	231.3	 reward them heavily for going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=233.7s	233.7	 Now if you don't catch them in the act, there's nothing you can do other than pick up the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=237.9s	237.9	 mess, throw it away and do a better job supervising them in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=241.7s	241.7	 Think of the crate as a bedroom for your dog, but you want to make it the coolest, most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=245.8s	245.8	 awesome bedroom you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=247.2s	247.2	 You want them to love being in that crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=250.3s	250.3	 Midwest Homes for Pets is sponsoring this video, but I actually approached them because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 I've been using the crates for years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=255.4s	255.4	 I find them to be very reliable, well built and the quality of them is fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=260.5s	260.5	 Plus they give you a couple of things that a lot of crates don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=263.1s	263.1	 I really like the Max Lock Door system on this Life Stages crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=267.2s	267.2	 You'll also notice that there's a divider panel in here, so that way you don't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=271.2s	271.2	 to buy various crates for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=273.3s	273.3	 Let me explain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=274.3s	274.3	 You see, when you are potty training your dog specifically, in the beginning stages,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 you want the crate to be just big enough for them to turn around and lie down in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=282.8s	282.8	 Instinctively, dogs don't like to go potty where they sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 Now, be patient with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=287.1s	287.1	 In the beginning, they may have an accident or two as they're making this connection,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=290.2s	290.2	 but it should be very short lived.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=292.5s	292.5	 What's great about this Max Lock Door system too, is you don't have to kneel at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=297.2s	297.2	 You can pull it up, open it, and it gives you extra security around the entire perimeter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=301.5s	301.5	 of the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=302.5s	302.5	 These are also highly portable crates too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=304.8s	304.8	 They fold up, so you don't have to take them apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=306.9s	306.9	 They come fully assembled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=308.1s	308.1	 So I highly recommend the crates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=309.7s	309.7	 If you don't have one, I'll have a link in the description where you can pick one up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 if you need one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=314.2s	314.2	 I'm here with Luna today.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=334.8s	334.8	 and leave them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=336.8s	336.8	 Now, I like to actually use real meat to really give them that positive association with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=344.1s	344.1	 very early on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=345.3s	345.3	 What I like to do is open both doors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=347.7s	347.7	 This is a double door crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=349.1s	349.1	 One of the benefits of having a two door crate is that you have the benefit of really opening

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=354.2s	354.2	 This will make it a little bit more appealing for your dog to go in and explore, and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=357.7s	357.7	 won't feel quite so shut in in the beginning phases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=360.5s	360.5	 Plus, it'll give you more options on how to position the crate within your home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=364.5s	364.5	 It gives them a nice opening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=365.5s	365.5	 It makes it a nice place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=367.3s	367.3	 Very good, Luna.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=369.3s	369.3	 Always let your dog know that you appreciate when they're doing something you like, and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=374.5s	374.5	 Do not try and rush this process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=377.6s	377.6	 If it takes you a day or two, so be it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=379.6s	379.6	 Just be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=380.6s	380.6	 Now, most dogs will get pretty comfortable with this early on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=384.5s	384.5	 Patience fuels progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=385.5s	385.5	 Let's say you've already tried to rush the process, and your dog is now terrified of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=389.3s	389.3	 the crate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=392.2s	392.2	 Now, you're going to need to be a little extra patient with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=394.7s	394.7	 You get the best results when you're not rushing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=397.6s	397.6	 Luna's doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=398.9s	398.9	 She's taking beautifully to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=400.9s	400.9	 So just to be clear, we're getting Luna comfortable with walking in and out of the crate on her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=404.9s	404.9	 own terms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=405.9s	405.9	 Once you feel like your dog is comfortable going in and out of the crate like this, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=410.8s	410.8	 you want to introduce the idea of closing a door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=413.4s	413.4	 This is the part where we want to be very delicate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=416.1s	416.1	 This is also the point where a lot of people set their training back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=419.7s	419.7	 The benefit of having a two-door crate like this is you can close one door, and then you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=424.3s	424.3	 can encourage them to go in with one door here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=427.4s	427.4	 By closing one door at a time, you're making the crate a little bit smaller, but your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=431.3s	431.3	 still has the option to come out of the crate should they start to feel uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=436.5s	436.5	 Since many of you are beginners, this is also a far-reaching theme within our dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=442.4s	442.4	 It's a good idea to break things down into smaller steps like this regularly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=446.4s	446.4	 Now once she goes in, if she's comfortable, I'm going to close the door, but I'm only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=449.7s	449.7	 going to do it for a brief moment as if to suggest to her, look, it's going to close,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=453.2s	453.2	 but it'll open again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=454.3s	454.3	 Don't worry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=455.3s	455.3	 Go on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=456.3s	456.3	 The last message we want to send to our dogs is, hey, I'm going to put you in this crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=461.1s	461.1	 and I'm going to lock you in it forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=462.6s	462.6	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=464.4s	464.4	 So watch this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=465.4s	465.4	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=466.4s	466.4	 It's the moment of truth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=467.4s	467.4	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=468.4s	468.4	 She reacted very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=470.5s	470.5	 I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=471.5s	471.5	 I'm going to let her right back out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=473.5s	473.5	 During the first several days of introducing your dog to a crate, it's a good idea to just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=477.2s	477.2	 leave the doors open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=478.3s	478.3	 Let them come and go as they please when you're supervising them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=481.4s	481.4	 Avoid picking them up and putting them in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=483.6s	483.6	 Remember, the goal here is to get them to go in voluntarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=487.1s	487.1	 Some things that will help you with that are feeding them their meals in their crate, giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=491.2s	491.2	 them good chew toys and other toys to play with in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=495.2s	495.2	 So you're starting to get the picture here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=497.0s	497.0	 We want the crate to be an ideal place for them to be and we want them to want to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=502.2s	502.2	 there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=504.0s	504.0	 It's a good idea to have it next to your bed when you sleep at night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=506.3s	506.3	 That way your dog will be less stressed out in this new environment here because you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=510.4s	510.4	 right there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=515.2s	515.2	 what you signed on for when you got a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=517.5s	517.5	 Don't worry.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=525.7s	525.7	 If your dog shows any signs of stress or discomfort when introducing them to the crate, that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=530.4s	530.4	 your cue to slow down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=533.2s	533.2	 Now some dogs, especially dogs with severe separation anxiety or other types of severe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=537.6s	537.6	 anxiety will never be okay with crate training.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=541.6s	541.6	 That's part of accepting our dogs for who they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=543.9s	543.9	 For those dogs, we'll bypass crate training in favor of more direct supervision while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=548.2s	548.2	 we work with them through those more complex issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=551.5s	551.5	 Let's talk about the maximum period of time that we would allow our dogs to be in a crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=555.2s	555.2	 for at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=556.9s	556.9	 The general rule is one hour per month of age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=560.3s	560.3	 So a four month old dog would never be in a crate more than four hours at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=565.1s	565.1	 Now the maximum time any dog should be in a crate is six hours and that's pushing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=569.6s	569.6	 So try and avoid keeping them in for that long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=572.6s	572.6	 Since many of you are going to have your dog sleep in a crate, you'll let them out in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=577.2s	577.2	 morning but then you may have to go off to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=579.8s	579.8	 So it's a good idea to schedule in some extra time to give them that workout so that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=584.4s	584.4	 can at least put them back into the crate while they're tired before returning home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=588.9s	588.9	 to let them out for a potty break at lunch or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=592.0s	592.0	 Now if you have to be gone longer than the allotted time, here are some options for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-gyJP8op0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=601&pp=iAQB&t=596.8s	596.8	 You can take them to dog daycare.
