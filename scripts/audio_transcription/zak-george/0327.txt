https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1.0s	1.0	 That's a little too rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=2.0s	2.0	 You're getting a little too rough there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 I'm taking you along as I train her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=12.8s	12.8	 You can start from the beginning or pick up anywhere and start learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=16.7s	16.7	 Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 Today Inertia will go to puppy class, encounter explosives, learn a couple of tricks, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=25.6s	25.6	 we'll do some training around water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=27.6s	27.6	 For those of you who are following along with Inertia's journey with your own puppy, I think

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=37.3s	37.3	 This series that you're watching right now with Inertia is going on indefinitely, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=40.9s	40.9	 30 Day Perfect Pup is an awesome online crash course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 I designed that course with Pupford to be a comprehensive guide to all of the foundational

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 We have an exciting night tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=63.3s	63.3	 It's going to be Inertia's first socialization experience with other puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=67.9s	67.9	 So we're going to do a puppy class tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=69.4s	69.4	 It's been a long time since I've done a puppy class, so I can't wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=72.5s	72.5	 We've arrived here at Inertia's first puppy class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=75.5s	75.5	 Hopefully it'll go well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 You know, I always recommend that people get to these classes extra early so you allow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 your dog time to acclimate and get used to the environment and the smells and all that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=83.5s	83.5	 good stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 You know, I always say to my dog, when your dog is in a new environment, they won't always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=86.9s	86.9	 take treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=87.9s	87.9	 Let's see if she'll take this treat right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 Yeah?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=90.9s	90.9	 See, she's a little reluctant to take treats that she normally does, but that's again because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=96.3s	96.3	 the environment is so different and overwhelming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 When I train a dog, I like to just get right on the ground here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=100.9s	100.9	 While we're waiting for other dogs to get here, I'm doing some basic conditioning since
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 she's now more comfortable taking treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 Again, just trying to equate these wonderful treats with this brand new environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=112.5s	112.5	 I want her to think new places are fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=115.2s	115.2	 In general, I'm discouraging on-leash greetings because the leash can interfere in many ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 with proper puppy socialization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=122.4s	122.4	 But I figured I'd bend the rules a little and let Inertia have a brief meeting with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=126.2s	126.2	 Luca.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=127.2s	127.2	 Okay, and I'll discourage after this just so because I know his leashes are about to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=129.9s	129.9	 get tangled up, but...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=133.9s	133.9	 Good job, Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=136.9s	136.9	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=137.9s	137.9	 See if I can get her voluntarily over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=140.9s	140.9	 Come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=141.9s	141.9	 Oops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=142.9s	142.9	 Nope, too excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=145.5s	145.5	 That was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=146.5s	146.5	 You did so well and so did you, Luca.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=148.5s	148.5	 You're so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=149.5s	149.5	 I'm going to pet you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 Socialization is important to show dogs good manners and reduce the likelihood of having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 issues with other dogs later in life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=157.4s	157.4	 We're going to take them off leash now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 We're going to let the dogs go check each other out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=161.3s	161.3	 Inertia is just kind of still checking it out over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=163.8s	163.8	 Just kind of watching everyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=165.1s	165.1	 It's really important to just let them do this on their own terms at this age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 If they want to back away and hang out, that's fine for right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=172.1s	172.1	 Give her time to take it all in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=173.7s	173.7	 If a puppy tries to escape, for example by hiding under a chair or a table, let them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 take their time and return to the playgroup on their terms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 She's getting curious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 Look at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 Here she goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 She's a little shy there, but she's warming up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=186.9s	186.9	 You can see Inertia is the kind of dog who's pretty reserved around other dogs so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 We'll see how that shapes up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 I think it's all a healthy skepticism if you ask me, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 I suppose it's also worth noting that she's the youngest dog in the class at nine and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 a half weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 I would expect to see her get more and more comfortable, but that doesn't always happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=204.3s	204.3	 We'll just have to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=205.3s	205.3	 How is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 You see the puppy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=207.3s	207.3	 That's a puppy dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=208.3s	208.3	 See all these puppies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=209.3s	209.3	 They want to play with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=211.8s	211.8	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=212.8s	212.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=213.8s	213.8	 Looks like she's thinking about getting playful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=218.4s	218.4	 Very healthy greeting right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=221.2s	221.2	 That was a wonderful experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=223.2s	223.2	 She's reciprocating over here, saying hi back in her own way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=227.1s	227.1	 And so you could see she got nervous for a moment there, but she's come out and she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=230.4s	230.4	 kind of off and on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 She's thinking about it and there she doesn't quite know how to play yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=236.7s	236.7	 She really loves Luca.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=238.1s	238.1	 Although it's good to find puppies of a similar size and age to play with your dog, finding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=242.4s	242.4	 puppies with a similar play style is most important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 You'll know your puppy has found a great playmate when they both look like they're having an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 equal amount of fun while playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 During playtime, you should keep an eye on the puppies and make sure that one of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=254.9s	254.9	 isn't consistently ending up being the one at the bottom of the puppy pile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=258.6s	258.6	 Oh, there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=259.6s	259.6	 That's some rough mousin'.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 Getting crazy now, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=261.6s	261.6	 That's a little too rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 You're getting a little too rough there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 So if you find that play sessions are getting a little bit too intense, just break up the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 play session and give them a short break before a more serious conflict happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 With her being so extra nippy right now, I want to keep everything going smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=277.8s	277.8	 Teach her those good manners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=280.3s	280.3	 If you are doing a puppy class like this or some other type of puppy socialization, mix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=284.3s	284.3	 things up between the different dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=286.6s	286.6	 Encourage them to play with other dogs in the group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 Keep an eye on your puppy and if they start to seem tired or a little irritable, give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=292.7s	292.7	 them some rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=293.7s	293.7	 In other words, you don't want your puppy to get to the point where they're so irritated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=297.1s	297.1	 because they've been playing so much that they start snapping at other puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 Puppy class is obviously great for giving your dog experience interacting with other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=305.1s	305.1	 puppies, but it's also a great opportunity to teach your dog how to shift their mindset
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=309.7s	309.7	 from playing to training and focusing on you or settling down when you need them to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 Week one of puppy class was a blast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=317.6s	317.6	 Inertia started off pretty nervous, but she came around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=320.3s	320.3	 If you want to know more about socializing your puppy or your older dog, get both of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=323.9s	323.9	 my books.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=324.9s	324.9	 I'll have links in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 The 4th of July is tomorrow and I found a fireworks display going on tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=331.2s	331.2	 So I'm going to try to gently introduce Inertia to fireworks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 So you might be able to hear in the background there's some fireworks going on right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=340.0s	340.0	 Inertia is over here in her crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=341.8s	341.8	 I'm doing some desensitizing with her to fireworks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=344.5s	344.5	 So far she's doing pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=345.5s	345.5	 I'm going to go ahead and take her out of the crate, but they started earlier than we thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=349.0s	349.0	 She is immediately nervous of the fireworks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=350.8s	350.8	 She's not very accepting of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=352.4s	352.4	 So that's one of the reasons I wanted to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=354.6s	354.6	 I'm getting her used to the sound from a vast distance over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 I'm just going to pick her up, see if she'll take the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=361.2s	361.2	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 She's licking on them a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=363.3s	363.3	 What the?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=364.3s	364.3	 She's not pulling away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=365.8s	365.8	 Still not taking treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=367.0s	367.0	 That's my cue to go very low key right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=369.5s	369.5	 I wouldn't want to push her into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=371.2s	371.2	 You can imagine if we just decided to bring her to a fireworks show, like full on, she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=376.3s	376.3	 would likely be stressing out a lot more right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=378.8s	378.8	 If she wants to get down off my lap, I'll let her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=380.4s	380.4	 Let me see what happens if I do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=382.3s	382.3	 She comes back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=384.1s	384.1	 What happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=385.1s	385.1	 It seems like she feels safe right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=387.6s	387.6	 Fine with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=389.9s	389.9	 Let's see what happens if I put her here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=392.9s	392.9	 What is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=393.9s	393.9	 You want to stay here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=394.9s	394.9	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=395.9s	395.9	 Let her check it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=396.9s	396.9	 So she's a lot more comfortable here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=398.2s	398.2	 So bottom line right here, her first exposure to fireworks, and I'd say it's guarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=404.0s	404.0	 She's not totally freaking out, but she's also not like, hey, that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=407.8s	407.8	 That's why we want to be sensitive and be proactive about exposing our dogs to new things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=412.0s	412.0	 like fireworks, be prepared to snap into one of these training sessions and just give them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=416.3s	416.3	 reassurance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=417.3s	417.3	 Now she can see she's come off my lap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=424.5s	424.5	 Seeming a little bit braver now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=426.9s	426.9	 Let's see if she takes a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=428.1s	428.1	 You want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=429.1s	429.1	 Nope, still not interested in treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=431.1s	431.1	 Again, that's a sign that she's either full or probably a little bit anxious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=436.2s	436.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=438.4s	438.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=439.4s	439.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=440.4s	440.4	 The fireworks display has just concluded and well, would you know it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=444.4s	444.4	 She's taking treats again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=445.6s	445.6	 That was a great rehearsal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=447.2s	447.2	 And now it's the actual Fourth of July.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=450.3s	450.3	 Our friend and photographer Rachel is here to take some Fourth of July pictures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=454.7s	454.7	 We're doing a photo shoot right now and we've got fireworks going off in the background
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=459.3s	459.3	 just little by little because it is early in the evening on the Fourth of July.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=464.4s	464.4	 So I'm also going to be doing some of this conditioning as the fireworks go off in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=467.7s	467.7	 background to reduce the likelihood that she'll be nervous of the fireworks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=471.2s	471.2	 Of course, right now she could not care less about the fireworks or the photo shoot and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=475.0s	475.0	 she's more interested in the grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=476.8s	476.8	 Welcome to practical puppy raising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=479.2s	479.2	 So it's getting darker and I know she had her trial run yesterday on July 3rd.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=482.9s	482.9	 They do some fireworks in the general area, but we live right here on the lake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=487.2s	487.2	 So this is kind of the destination where people come to shoot off fireworks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=490.6s	490.6	 One of the things that you have to contend with if you have a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=493.7s	493.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=494.7s	494.7	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=495.7s	495.7	 See her reacting there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=496.7s	496.7	 Very healthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=497.7s	497.7	 Will she take the hot dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=498.7s	498.7	 Yes, she will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=499.7s	499.7	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=500.7s	500.7	 I'm totally fine with her noticing the fireworks clearly and this is all real nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=504.3s	504.3	 Good job, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=505.5s	505.5	 Lots of different sounds and smells happening in a situation like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=509.5s	509.5	 If you have the ability to preempt your dog's fear like this and you know that predictable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=514.9s	514.9	 events like the 4th of July or New Year's are coming around, well, you know, be prepared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=519.2s	519.2	 to do a conditioning session like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=521.1s	521.1	 Now, let's say she was really, really scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=524.1s	524.1	 Protocol in that case would be to be inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=526.1s	526.1	 In fact, it might even be a good idea to start inside so that she can hear the fireworks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=529.9s	529.9	 a bit more faintly and then you can simply acknowledge the calm behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=533.4s	533.4	 Now, if your dog already had a fear, you would want to capture small moments of calmness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=538.4s	538.4	 and not bring them out in this situation just yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=541.5s	541.5	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=543.2s	543.2	 Fireworks are starting to go off around the neighborhood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=545.3s	545.3	 So I'm going to pop the drone up in the air and see how things are looking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=549.4s	549.4	 The fireworks are almost in full bloom right now and we're having a few that are going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=553.8s	553.8	 off really close out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=555.4s	555.4	 I'm just letting her nibble on this treat right now, keeping an eye on the drone shots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=559.3s	559.3	 above.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=560.3s	560.3	 Yes, when she notices the fireworks and reacts that way, I'm just clicking and giving her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=566.6s	566.6	 a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=567.6s	567.6	 My neighbor's setting them off real close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=569.2s	569.2	 I'm kind of trying to hope to get her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=571.3s	571.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=572.3s	572.3	 Oh, those were real close by right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=574.4s	574.4	 And again, really doing well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=577.0s	577.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=578.8s	578.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=579.8s	579.8	 And so you can actually condition your dog to associate fireworks with something really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=585.5s	585.5	 good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=586.6s	586.6	 That is the hypothesis here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=588.6s	588.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=589.6s	589.6	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=592.2s	592.2	 Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=593.2s	593.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=594.2s	594.2	 What was that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=595.2s	595.2	 Oh, that one was scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=596.8s	596.8	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=597.8s	597.8	 You want that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=598.8s	598.8	 Oh, she's still taking treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=600.6s	600.6	 So clearly, I mean, that would startle me right there, but she's doing a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=604.1s	604.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=605.1s	605.1	 I'm going to go into it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=609.4s	609.4	 Let's see if we can get her doing a few of her tricks here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=612.0s	612.0	 Okay, I'll take a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=613.4s	613.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=614.4s	614.4	 Will you give me a down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=617.4s	617.4	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=618.4s	618.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=619.7s	619.7	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=620.7s	620.7	 Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=621.7s	621.7	 Nothing to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=623.5s	623.5	 See?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=624.6s	624.6	 Again, nothing, no harm in her acknowledging it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=627.3s	627.3	 What's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=628.7s	628.7	 It works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=629.8s	629.8	 So that one, you know, there was a real test right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=632.6s	632.6	 And so now she's kind of refusing, just momentarily refusing the treat, which would indicate a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=637.2s	637.2	 little bit of anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=638.6s	638.6	 She's getting a little frantic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=639.9s	639.9	 So right now she's showing a bit of anxiety, being a bit more nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=643.7s	643.7	 So I'll go ahead and give her some space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=644.9s	644.9	 We'll go back inside now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=646.0s	646.0	 So now that we're back inside, you can see she's a lot more at ease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=649.9s	649.9	 She feels safer in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=651.4s	651.4	 That's the thing with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=652.8s	652.8	 We'll have to see where their level of tolerance is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=655.7s	655.7	 Since we found her limit, I think it's a good idea to bring her back in and let her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=660.0s	660.0	 recover a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=661.0s	661.0	 After a few minutes, she seemed to really bounce back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=663.8s	663.8	 So let's go on the patio, which is still close to an area where she seems to feel safe and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=668.9s	668.9	 see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=669.9s	669.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=670.9s	670.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=671.9s	671.9	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=672.9s	672.9	 Here you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=673.9s	673.9	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=674.9s	674.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=675.9s	675.9	 You want to stay right here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=678.1s	678.1	 Let's stay right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=679.1s	679.1	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=680.1s	680.1	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=681.1s	681.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=682.9s	682.9	 It did work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=683.9s	683.9	 It's a fine line between just going back inside and forgetting it and giving her this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=688.3s	688.3	 opportunity to have some desensitizing as well as some conditioning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=692.9s	692.9	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=696.9s	696.9	 You want to come here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=697.9s	697.9	 Because ultimately, my goal is to let her know she can feel safe with me and she can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=701.7s	701.7	 trust me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=703.3s	703.3	 And even when things make her uneasy, I'd like her to be able to work through those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=706.8s	706.8	 things, assuming she's at that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=709.1s	709.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=711.1s	711.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=713.1s	713.1	 Isn't that neat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=714.1s	714.1	 What is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=715.1s	715.1	 So interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=720.1s	720.1	 There she's looking a little curious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=722.1s	722.1	 So all in all, I'd say it was a pretty good training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=725.1s	725.1	 Inertia and I have been working on the basics for the last few days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=728.1s	728.1	 I think it's about time to train Inertia some more tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=731.1s	731.1	 Inertia is 10 weeks old today and I have gotten really used to having untied shoelaces full
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=736.1s	736.1	 time, so that's kind of cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=738.0s	738.0	 But we are starting to get better and better communication every single day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=742.0s	742.0	 I want to teach her how to crawl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=744.0s	744.0	 I'm just going to start by luring her and seeing what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=747.0s	747.0	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=748.0s	748.0	 Oh, I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=749.0s	749.0	 If you're new to my channel, the click here just means good dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=752.0s	752.0	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=753.0s	753.0	 You get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=754.0s	754.0	 That's all it means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=755.0s	755.0	 I have more videos on my channel explaining it if you need more info.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=758.0s	758.0	 All I'm looking for here is for her to move her paws and just, yeah, just the faintest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=762.0s	762.0	 way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=763.0s	763.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=764.0s	764.0	 Yes, crawl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=765.0s	765.0	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=767.0s	767.0	 And as a reminder, I'm using the clicker and the word yes kind of interchangeably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=773.0s	773.0	 Crawl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1018.0s	1018.0	 And that's what I'm hoping to do with inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1020.0s	1020.0	 I want to be able to communicate with her on a very deep, intricate level moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1025.0s	1025.0	 So tricks really help you refine that communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1027.0s	1027.0	 It's super hot here in the South and I would love to have a way for inertia to cool off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1032.0s	1032.0	 So I wanted to introduce her to this idea of getting in a kiddie pool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1035.0s	1035.0	 Producer Bree is bringing inertia's new toy in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1038.0s	1038.0	 And inertia is already instantly, cautiously looking at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1041.0s	1041.0	 When your dog is nervous like this, especially with a puppy or any dog, give them the option
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1045.0s	1045.0	 to have somewhere to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1046.0s	1046.0	 Don't just try to shove it down their throat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1048.0s	1048.0	 I'm going to introduce this pool over here to inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1051.0s	1051.0	 Just empty it first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1052.0s	1052.0	 Let's see what she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1053.0s	1053.0	 Hey, inertia, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1055.0s	1055.0	 I'm going to move it a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1057.0s	1057.0	 I'm going to click her for just looking at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1059.0s	1059.0	 Here you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1060.0s	1060.0	 And now that we're establishing a history here, she should learn that when there's a clicker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1064.0s	1064.0	 and treats present, it might be good news for her to investigate this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1068.0s	1068.0	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1069.0s	1069.0	 I put a little treat in there just to see what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 I'm clicking and dispensing treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1076.0s	1076.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1078.0s	1078.0	 Nothing like treats to incentivize your dog to investigate something new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1082.0s	1082.0	 This is going to be a good example of rate of reinforcement right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1085.0s	1085.0	 So I'm going to dramatically up the rate at which I reward right now, because I know she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1090.0s	1090.0	 kind of on pins and needles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1092.0s	1092.0	 She's like, this thing is new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1093.0s	1093.0	 I'm a little unsure about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1095.0s	1095.0	 I'm going to make it rain treats right now to let her know she's on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1100.0s	1100.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1101.0s	1101.0	 Now I'm going to encourage her to get out of the kiddie pool here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1105.0s	1105.0	 See if she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1107.0s	1107.0	 Inertia, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1109.0s	1109.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1110.0s	1110.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1111.0s	1111.0	 At this point in her training, I'm still giving very generous rewards almost every time that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1115.0s	1115.0	 she comes to me, like extra generous above and beyond, because come when called is such
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1119.0s	1119.0	 an important skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1121.0s	1121.0	 Yes, there's some initiative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1123.0s	1123.0	 That was a good example of just taking it slow to introduce something new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1126.0s	1126.0	 It might be very tempting to just grab your dog and put them in the pool, but that's likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1131.0s	1131.0	 to throw off many, many dogs out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1134.0s	1134.0	 So be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1135.0s	1135.0	 Patience is one of the most important things you have to remember when teaching a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1139.0s	1139.0	 Look at her frame of mind now, just compared to a moment ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1142.0s	1142.0	 While this is in part introducing your dog to something new, like a kid's pool, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1148.0s	1148.0	 also building that trust between one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1151.0s	1151.0	 This experience tells her, OK, when I'm uncertain in the future, maybe I can trust you to walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1156.0s	1156.0	 me through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1157.0s	1157.0	 Let's see what she thinks about the ball in the pool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1159.0s	1159.0	 Ooh, maybe we're onto something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1161.0s	1161.0	 This is done in the spirit of getting her playing in the presence of something new,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1165.0s	1165.0	 something that just a moment ago she was quite nervous of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1168.0s	1168.0	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1171.0s	1171.0	 Yes, and that time it even moved and she handled that really brave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1175.0s	1175.0	 Look, now she's just like all about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1179.0s	1179.0	 I'm moving it around in everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1181.0s	1181.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1184.0s	1184.0	 Well, that went so well inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1185.0s	1185.0	 Let's just give her the opportunity to explore it outside and see if that makes a difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1189.0s	1189.0	 We've also put a little bit of water in it this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1192.0s	1192.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1193.0s	1193.0	 She's like, that's the largest bowl of water I've ever seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1196.0s	1196.0	 Oh, interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1198.0s	1198.0	 Not so interested in the treat immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1199.0s	1199.0	 It might take her a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1200.0s	1200.0	 Let's see what happens if we show her the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1202.0s	1202.0	 Wonder what will happen if I just toss a treat in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1205.0s	1205.0	 See if she decides to go with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1207.0s	1207.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1208.0s	1208.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1209.0s	1209.0	 Here you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1211.0s	1211.0	 You want that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1212.0s	1212.0	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1213.0s	1213.0	 Sometimes I'm clicking and throwing a treat in the pool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1215.0s	1215.0	 Sometimes I'm clicking and treating her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1217.0s	1217.0	 But right now I just want her to know that every time the click goes off, a treat is getting dispensed in her vicinity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1223.0s	1223.0	 It's a little bit of an unconventional way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1225.0s	1225.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1226.0s	1226.0	 To use a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1227.0s	1227.0	 She doesn't seem to mind that the treats are soaking wet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1230.0s	1230.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1231.0s	1231.0	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1235.0s	1235.0	 Very cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1236.0s	1236.0	 You're doing great, inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1237.0s	1237.0	 I wonder if we can fill it up a little bit more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1238.0s	1238.0	 I obviously have to fill the pool up a little bit more with this hose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1241.0s	1241.0	 But if you've ever just turned on a hose around a dog, well, it can go one of a couple of ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1245.0s	1245.0	 Either they just love it and start snatching the water out of the air or they just get totally freaked out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1250.0s	1250.0	 So I'm going to be pretty methodical about the way I introduce a hose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1253.0s	1253.0	 So far she hasn't noticed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1259.0s	1259.0	 There she just did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1260.0s	1260.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1264.0s	1264.0	 Notice the higher rate of reinforcement here because she's a bit guarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1267.0s	1267.0	 So I'm just clicking, letting her know clicker and treats come out when this thing is out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1271.0s	1271.0	 I kind of like that she's being inquisitive about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1273.0s	1273.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1274.0s	1274.0	 Just fill it up a little bit here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1276.0s	1276.0	 So I'm turning it on a bit more here and she's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDxsyigJDQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=1279.0s	1279.0	 Yes.
