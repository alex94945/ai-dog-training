https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 My name is Ivan Hoy Jr. and my dog's name is Storm and she is 12 weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 I am an actor, writer, and I actually was Jonah Hill's stand-in and photo double on 22 Jump Street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 Storm's not the only cute one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 I was also in a deleted scene of Pitch Perfect, which was pretty cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=36.9s	36.9	 So if you like looking at this pretty face, contact my agent Tasha Mills at Talent Connections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 Well, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=43.2s	43.2	 Storm, give me my phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=44.1s	44.1	 I'm so sorry. She has an Instagram account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 She has about 137 followers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=48.8s	48.8	 I think she's more famous than I am.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=50.3s	50.3	 Storm is actually doing very well with sit, stay, and a few other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=54.4s	54.4	 We're having issues with potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=56.1s	56.1	 Her chewing things up and not listening to me when I'm calling her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=59.3s	59.3	 Zach, how can I get the best results in the shortest amount of time with Storm?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=62.3s	62.3	 Oh, this is so much funner than training dogs anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=64.8s	64.8	 Let's just forget today's training video and do this instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 So think about it. What's the first thing that most people do when they bring home a new dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 They walk through the door, set their dog down in the house, and then just hope for the best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 Boy, she is definitely going through that biting phase right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 Now, if you've got a dog under five months, there's a really good chance that they'll stay near you without much encouragement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=83.5s	83.5	 I mean, dogs this age are pretty clingy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=85.6s	85.6	 But don't be lax about controlling their environment for the next 12 months, at least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=90.6s	90.6	 You must be meticulous about this if you're serious about getting results with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 I mean, the number one mistake that new puppy parents make with their new dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 is giving them way too much freedom way too early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=100.9s	100.9	 Hey, it's an easy mistake to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 If your dog is having potty accidents, chewing up possessions, jumping on guests, or not coming when you call them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=108.2s	108.2	 these are all telltale signs of an uncontrolled environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=111.5s	111.5	 And this will likely significantly delay successful training in many areas with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 See, those experiences create bad habits, and bad habits are way more challenging to reverse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 than simply preventing them from becoming established in the first place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=124.2s	124.2	 Storm, you can't just bite me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=126.3s	126.3	 Now, this point is big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=127.9s	127.9	 Just because your dog is inside your house does not mean they're in a sufficiently controlled environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=132.7s	132.7	 I've lost total control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 Storm is walking on the furniture, the table, the couch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=137.4s	137.4	 I think we need a dog trainer around here or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=139.4s	139.4	 Do you have the hiccups?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=140.8s	140.8	 I don't think I've ever seen a husky puppy with hiccups before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=143.8s	143.8	 Boo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 Now, there are several ways to control your dog's environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=146.9s	146.9	 The best way is to have them attached to you with a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=150.1s	150.1	 That way, you're right there to give them instantaneous feedback and really let them know what you like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=154.5s	154.5	 and prevent things you don't like from happening at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 For short periods of time, a crate can be an easy way to keep your pup safe and out of trouble
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 when you absolutely can't tend to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=163.7s	163.7	 Understandably, you can't always have your dog on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 and you certainly can't have them spending too much time in a crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=169.1s	169.1	 Now, eventually your dog's going to have to behave in the house when you're not completely focused on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=173.3s	173.3	 But you don't just give them access to the entire house and just keep your fingers crossed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 that everything's going to go well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=179.2s	179.2	 Because it won't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=180.3s	180.3	 Pet gates really hit the sweet spot for this type of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 So let's cover some ways that we can use pet gates to rapidly increase our training success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=187.5s	187.5	 Ivan's definitely got his hands full with this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 Pet gates give your dog the freedom to explore more freely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=193.2s	193.2	 and you don't run the risk of them sneaking off and acquiring those hard to fix bad habits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=198.1s	198.1	 Gradually giving your dog access to the rest of the house is by far the best way to transition to more freedom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 successfully without your dog destroying your house or getting into the habit of dismissing your request.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 She's chewing the rug because I'm busy making a YouTube video or scratching at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 So I'm going to try to redirect her attention onto me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=216.7s	216.7	 Now I'm not just going to give it the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 I'm going to ask for a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 I'm going to ask for a look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=220.9s	220.9	 And look, Ivan's done such a good job of teaching her to lie down already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=224.6s	224.6	 I'll put her into a down too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=225.7s	225.7	 So just to be clear, she's not getting the treat for chewing the rug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=228.5s	228.5	 She's getting the treat for stopping chewing the rug, paying attention to me, sitting and lying down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=233.5s	233.5	 All that for one treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=234.7s	234.7	 These steel pet gates by Midwest Homes for Pets are the once again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=237.9s	237.9	 Let me show you why.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 Well, first, they take like five minutes to install, which is significant because I can't install anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 These are really solid and sturdy and they fit into lots of different places easily and securely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 You can even get extensions up to 52 inches if you have a larger doorway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 We're filming over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 OK, that's good. No, no over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=256.2s	256.2	 Storm Storm has a long way to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 Unlike a traditional gate, this is a door so you can just walk through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 No, that's the carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=263.7s	263.7	 Help. How do I get to her?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 If you need to get to your dog, fortunately, it's a one handed operation and it opens both ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 It closes on its own to storm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=271.7s	271.7	 You can't chew on the carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=273.2s	273.2	 Of course, if you can redirect their attention on a tug toy, that's awesome, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=276.5s	276.5	 Whatever it takes to get their attention on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 That's what you're trying to accomplish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=279.8s	279.8	 Sometimes that's more challenging than others, but that's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=282.5s	282.5	 This model even glows in the dark, so it's really easy to see at night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=285.7s	285.7	 You are so crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=287.1s	287.1	 These steel gates come in two sizes, 29 inches and 39 inches, depending on the size of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=292.7s	292.7	 This is a 39 inch and these keep your door completely functional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=296.8s	296.8	 Well, unless you have a husky between the gate and the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=299.6s	299.6	 But that way you can actually still enjoy the functioning door and the gate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 You're very well contained dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=304.9s	304.9	 I think you're going to need the 39 inch model, though, because you've grown like two inches since we started filming today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=310.2s	310.2	 And they come in nice colors like graphite and white and materials matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=313.8s	313.8	 So a steel pet gate is going to be extremely durable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 If your dog is past their chewing phase, this one has a really nice decorative wood door to up the style factor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=322.2s	322.2	 If your dog tends to jump on guests when they arrive, it can be really convenient to have a place like this to secure your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 While you say hi to your guests at first, that is until you're ready to give your dog attention and train them once you guys are settled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=334.5s	334.5	 You can also use these gates to create a small puppy proofed area in bathrooms or laundry rooms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=339.9s	339.9	 Since fetch is such an important skill, especially for energetic dogs like Storm, it's really important to prioritize teaching this to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=347.1s	347.1	 See how we ignited that game of tug with her at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=349.7s	349.7	 She wasn't that interested, but I wiggled it and got her really interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=354.1s	354.1	 Now, if I need to let go, I'm going to toss it and see if she'll go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=357.5s	357.5	 Get it. Yes. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=359.6s	359.6	 See, at that moment, she would have clearly run out the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=362.3s	362.3	 Initial fetch training starts in a tiny area inside your house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=365.9s	365.9	 This keeps your dog from running all over the place with the toy, and it's much easier to get the game looking good and more solid when you start off this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=373.2s	373.2	 Keeping this room secure will help me keep her in the area, but still give her a little room to run around while we work on fetch training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=378.7s	378.7	 Not sure what game that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=380.4s	380.4	 So if you're trying to introduce your new pet to your current pet, this can be a really great way to allow them to have some mild interaction without them directly having access to each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=390.1s	390.1	 That way you can supervise them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=391.5s	391.5	 I'm going to have a link in the description where you can get your steel pet gates from Midwest Homes for Pets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=395.6s	395.6	 I'm a huge fan. They really do make category leading products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=398.8s	398.8	 I hope you've learned something about controlling your dog's environment today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 If so, click thumbs up and click thumbs up for Storm just because she's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=406.2s	406.2	 Make sure you're subscribed to my channel so you don't miss any of my videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRNJyfU8KiI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=471&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 And if you've got a new dog, definitely pick up a copy of my book, too.
