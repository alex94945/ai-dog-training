https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=215.8s	215.8	 was frightening, I'll say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 I just really helped build that show.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=223.8s	223.8	 Now I'm glad it happened because we built something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=227.3s	227.3	 very special to us on YouTube.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 What do we do? Zach said, I think I can sell some dog training classes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=244.1s	244.1	 if we put an ad out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=402.9s	402.9	 addressing the symptom, the biting and not the cause your dog's desire to interact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=408.2s	408.2	 with you whole like say, oh, and walk away.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=414.5s	414.5	 That's why I always said that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=416.4s	416.4	 But I mean, it can certainly help.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=420.9s	420.9	 ow, and you walk away, you're creating a consequence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=423.7s	423.7	 So it's still good advice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=425.1s	425.1	 I guess as a non expert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=427.6s	427.6	 Yes, as a layman, I have a thought on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=430.6s	430.6	 And it's in the recent times when I've been dealing with puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=435.0s	435.0	 Like, I don't really necessarily feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=437.2s	437.2	 like it is helping the puppy learn to not bite me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=440.2s	440.2	 But I feel like it's helping me when a puppy hurts you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=444.1s	444.1	 You have this negative emotion and being able to be like, ouch, like just make a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=456.1s	456.1	 That wouldn't be helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=465.8s	465.8	 For example, in Flurry's case, it's all of the time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=519.2s	519.2	 puppy biting? Well, number one, promptly initiate one of the training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=523.2s	523.2	 that we did today, exercise your dog or place them in a boring environment

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=588.2s	588.2	 because we had to film it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=589.0s	589.0	 Yeah. And they lived in a place that there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=591.2s	591.2	 were a lot of power lines and obstacles and stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=593.2s	593.2	 Yeah. You were piloting the drone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=594.9s	594.9	 I was. Plus, it's New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=596.4s	596.4	 It's a unique cemetery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=597.4s	597.4	 Yeah, because they bury you above ground in New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=599.5s	599.5	 Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=602.8s	602.8	 I think that they might.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=603.6s	603.6	 We struggled with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=605.1s	605.1	 We didn't know. We didn't want to necessarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=607.4s	607.4	 Yeah, we did think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=608.9s	608.9	 I give consent right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=610.0s	610.0	 If any of you want to film my grave when I'm gone, please feature me in your drone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=613.0s	613.0	 shots, unless it's a video about something stupid and then don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=616.2s	616.2	 Oh, you know what else?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=617.6s	617.6	 Right here, I promote my book for the first time ever in a video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=623.4s	623.4	 Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=630.5s	630.5	 That turned out to be my most watched video of all time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=633.9s	633.9	 Was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=635.8s	635.8	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=640.8s	640.8	 training book on Amazon when you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=642.4s	642.4	 We did this format where we would go to people's house and film, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=645.8s	645.8	 like it's me or the dog style, basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=647.7s	647.7	 Brittany, why did you decide to bring a new puppy into your life right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=651.2s	651.2	 Well, we both already had two cats and we've always wanted a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=655.0s	655.0	 And the cat kept photobombing the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=657.7s	657.7	 He was a cool cat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=659.1s	659.1	 I love cats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=659.7s	659.7	 I just he's a little bit scared of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=661.6s	661.6	 It depends on the cat because cats don't mess around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=664.0s	664.0	 Our cat is really cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=664.9s	664.9	 This cat was also really cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=666.7s	666.7	 It's kind of always fun to see the technology that we were using.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=670.0s	670.0	 Like you just saw the iPad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=671.4s	671.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=672.0s	672.0	 I think that was a first gen iPad Pro propped up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=674.8s	674.8	 Well, not just that, but we brought this rug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=678.1s	678.1	 Yeah, that's our rug and the lights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=680.8s	680.8	 Yeah, we brought the rug just so there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=682.1s	682.1	 would be traction for the puppy because they had all hardwoods there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=685.5s	685.5	 So we stopped at Target and got one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=687.2s	687.2	 Coming from TV, I took a lot of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=689.4s	689.4	 experience with me and tried to do the simplest version of that, that I could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=694.5s	694.5	 with a two or three person crew, trying to do all of that while keeping the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=698.3s	698.3	 training lesson in your mind was always challenging as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=701.3s	701.3	 Because you wanted to make sure the cameras were where you wanted them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=704.0s	704.0	 I would rely on the Lord training so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=706.8s	706.8	 during this format because I knew I only had a couple of hours with the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=711.1s	711.1	 Lord training is great because it shows people how to get traction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=714.8s	714.8	 But we don't want to become too Lord dependent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=717.2s	717.2	 And maybe that wasn't quite as clear enough in videos like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=721.1s	721.1	 Whereas, again, I think the series we do today is focused on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=727.4s	727.4	 taking your time more because you have like 24 hours a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=731.0s	731.0	 Well, yeah, you're able to show a more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=732.5s	732.5	 realistic right example of what you would actually do with a dog that you actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=738.2s	738.2	 have, not a dog that you have for two hours or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=742.0s	742.0	 There's value in this because you can go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=743.8s	743.8	 through a lot of different dogs week to week, whereas with series we do now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=747.8s	747.8	 we have one dog long term, you know, over the period of a few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=752.0s	752.0	 Yeah. Oh, there's a ton of value in this, too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=754.1s	754.1	 though, because it gives a more concise roadmap of just like step by step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=758.6s	758.6	 What you would do without the nuances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=760.5s	760.5	 But then, of course, the nuances are important, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=762.5s	762.5	 I saw a good cat photo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=764.2s	764.2	 Oh, yeah, there's the cat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=765.8s	765.8	 See?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=766.9s	766.9	 And he like we look at look at your face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=769.0s	769.0	 I'm like, I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=770.1s	770.1	 Tell me sticking to the dog over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=771.7s	771.7	 We tried a lot to keep him out, but that cat ruled the house as he should.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=775.5s	775.5	 Right. And there was a point where finally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=778.2s	778.2	 the rest of us convinced Zach to just let it go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=781.0s	781.0	 It was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=781.9s	781.9	 And we just like, yeah, let it be part of the scene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=785.5s	785.5	 Yeah, that's also one of my most viewed videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=788.1s	788.1	 But I want to react to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=789.5s	789.5	 I don't want to react to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=790.8s	790.8	 If you want us to react to BB8 potty training video, let me know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=794.8s	794.8	 I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=796.0s	796.0	 I couldn't let this video go without giving you guys a George update because you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=799.2s	799.2	 guys love him so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=800.6s	800.6	 I thought it might be of interest to all of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=802.6s	802.6	 He's been doing amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=803.8s	803.8	 His fetch is looking perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=805.5s	805.5	 So he and Alex are clearly hitting it off very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=808.9s	808.9	 And it got me thinking a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=811.1s	811.1	 must wonder what is that transition period like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=813.8s	813.8	 He had lived with us for a few weeks and now he's in this brand new life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=817.6s	817.6	 It's not always going to be the smoothest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=819.7s	819.7	 process necessarily getting to know and connect with a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=823.0s	823.0	 And of course, in any situation like this, there's bound to be some rocky moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=827.2s	827.2	 But since this is reality dog training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=830.2s	830.2	 I thought it would be great to show a learning moment between George and Alex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=833.1s	833.1	 that we were recently talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=834.8s	834.8	 So a few months ago, I got a text message from Alex saying I'm a little concerned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=839.8s	839.8	 about George because he might be showing aggressive tendencies towards me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=844.5s	844.5	 and my family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=845.8s	845.8	 So, of course, I'm thinking, oh, no, what's what's going on here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=849.8s	849.8	 I mean, is he because I haven't seen any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=852.1s	852.1	 what I would call aggressive behavior in his time with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=855.2s	855.2	 We went back and forth a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=856.6s	856.6	 trying to troubleshoot to see what was going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=859.4s	859.4	 And I asked her if it happens again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=862.0s	862.0	 if she's able to get any video of the behavior to show me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=865.7s	865.7	 Gosh, I have to go back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=867.0s	867.0	 We talk all the time about George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=868.6s	868.6	 I mean, I love this guy so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=870.4s	870.4	 We're always like, oh, George, what's going on today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=872.6s	872.6	 She sent me this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=874.8s	874.8	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=876.2s	876.2	 Stop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=878.5s	878.5	 Uh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=880.2s	880.2	 no, stop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=885.7s	885.7	 So there's George being being pretty pushy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=889.6s	889.6	 So I saw this and I was like, oh, yeah, I've seen him do that before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=892.2s	892.2	 He did that when he was staying with me a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=894.8s	894.8	 Typically, we dog trainers refer to this behavior as demand barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=898.3s	898.3	 And we definitely dealt with that with George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=901.2s	901.2	 The way I always interpreted it was George saying, hey, come on, let's go play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=904.5s	904.5	 Let's go do something. Let's have some fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=906.7s	906.7	 So I usually try to be ahead of that by exercising him early in the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=911.8s	911.8	 Nonetheless, he's a high energy guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=913.6s	913.6	 So sometimes he would have those outbursts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=915.3s	915.3	 And it's worth mentioning, a lot of behaviors like this do often get misinterpreted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=919.7s	919.7	 I did work on this a little bit with him in his last days with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=923.4s	923.4	 It was something that seemed to emerge a bit later on in our time together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=927.5s	927.5	 He's demanding that I come over there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=929.7s	929.7	 take him off that lead and play with him right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=933.3s	933.3	 At least that's what I interpret here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=944.2s	944.2	 There is an adjustment period, and with some dogs, it's longer than others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=947.3s	947.3	 But I have recently followed up with Alex to make sure everything was OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=951.6s	951.6	 We were just talking, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=953.2s	953.2	 And she said, yeah, when I thought he was being aggressive and it turned out he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=956.8s	956.8	 just trying to get my attention and acting like a toddler, he hasn't done that in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=960.9s	960.9	 months, thankfully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=961.9s	961.9	 So I'm glad she finally got a hold of it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=963.6s	963.6	 because that can be a stubborn issue, demand barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=966.1s	966.1	 And I'm so glad that phase is over and he is my bestie now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=970.5s	970.5	 And look at this awesome picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=972.2s	972.2	 There he is at the park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=974.0s	974.0	 I just wanted to give you that update on George and let you know he's doing well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=979.4s	979.4	 But that the process isn't always super smooth when a dog is adapting to a new home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=983.8s	983.8	 So if you're one of those people who's got a new dog and you're feeling really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=987.8s	987.8	 challenged, understand that's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=990.3s	990.3	 Once you really connect with a dog and get to know them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=993.1s	993.1	 that's when you can really start enjoying one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=995.9s	995.9	 And if you're ever feeling overwhelmed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=997.8s	997.8	 feel free to find a trainer to reach out to, get as many opinions as you can.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AO-zDL5Qs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=186&pp=iAQB&t=1006.9s	1006.9	 train them and give them awesome stuff, which is why BarkBox and SuperChewer are
