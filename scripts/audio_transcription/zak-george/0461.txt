https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 Hi, my name is Liz. I live in New Orleans with my family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=47.9s	47.9	 and I run my own home staging business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=50.4s	50.4	 We only got Hazel three weeks ago and she's 11 weeks old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 We decided to get a puppy because it's the right stage in our life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=56.6s	56.6	 to dedicate some time to training her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 We chose a golden doodle because we've always wanted a larger breed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=61.8s	61.8	 and they're so cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 I know she's still little but we wanted to set her up for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 so she can be a well-trained dog one day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 Zach, please help me help Hazel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 In order for me to help Liz with Hazel, we first have to teach her how to sit and stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=75.9s	75.9	 and how to get her to do it when she's tempted not to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 Throughout your dog's training, having them sit and stay will be very important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=82.7s	82.7	 In fact, this will likely be their default behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 when you suspect that they're about to become distracted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 or when they start biting or jumping on you as puppies often do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=91.3s	91.3	 So having sit, stay, pay attention to me will be very important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=95.4s	95.4	 so that you can essentially pause your dog in order for you to determine what to do next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=100.1s	100.1	 This is also one of your very first opportunities to truly teach your dog how to think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 because you're not going to make them do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 You're going to get them to do it voluntarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 Remember that using force during training is unnecessary and less effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 I'm using really tiny salmon treats today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=116.7s	116.7	 Teaching your dog to sit is as simple as luring them into a sit just like...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 Well, okay, that's the opposite of sit, sweetheart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=129.1s	129.1	 You can see her butt starts to go down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=131.3s	131.3	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=132.6s	132.6	 And it's really natural for puppies to want to use their paws like she's doing right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=136.6s	136.6	 But right now, as long as she's in a sit, I'm going to go ahead and release that treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=139.7s	139.7	 the moment her butt hits the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=141.3s	141.3	 So in the beginning, many puppies are real clumsy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=143.6s	143.6	 And if you move it too fast, they're like, hey, where'd the treat go?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=146.2s	146.2	 Most puppies are not quite yet conditioned to follow a lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 So it's really critical to go very slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=152.6s	152.6	 If you're new to this, you're probably going to lure like this way too fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 Let me pretend she's not here for a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=158.7s	158.7	 If there was an invisible dog right here, this is how fast the lure would be going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=164.9s	164.9	 See that real slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 Most puppies will catch on to this really quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 And Hazel is no exception.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=171.1s	171.1	 Look at that sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 That's looking so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 But of course, we don't want to have to lure our dogs into a sit for the rest of their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 So I'm going to start phasing out the lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=178.7s	178.7	 I'm going to show her the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=179.9s	179.9	 Look at that. Fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=181.3s	181.3	 So she went right into the sit when she saw the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 She's starting to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 Now that I'm reasonably confident that she's going to sit, I'm going to introduce the word
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=188.9s	188.9	 sit to her in advance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=190.4s	190.4	 So it looks like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=191.5s	191.5	 Sit. Yes. Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 So she's learning how to sit already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=196.7s	196.7	 She's doing great. And even a lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=198.7s	198.7	 How about that? I'll give you a treat for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=200.7s	200.7	 I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=201.4s	201.4	 Since she keeps jumping up on the table over here where I'm hiding my treats, I'm going to redirect her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 bring her over here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=209.2s	209.2	 And I'm going to ask her to sit so that she's actually earning the treat rather than reinforcing her for jumping on the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 I think it's time that we show her what stay means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 So I'm going to do the same thing that I just did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 But I'm going to take a little bit longer to get the treat to her this time, as if to say, hey, if you hold that sit position for just a little bit longer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 I'm going to give you the reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=231.6s	231.6	 So good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 Ready and sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=235.8s	235.8	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=236.8s	236.8	 I'm not even telling her to stay yet because I want to really make sure she understands the concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=242.1s	242.1	 Good job. The fact that she went into a down totally fine right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=245.8s	245.8	 She's staying in position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 I really like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=248.2s	248.2	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=252.7s	252.7	 Now, that's a good looking stay right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=254.6s	254.6	 Now, let's introduce the word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=256.4s	256.4	 I feel reasonably confident she's starting to get this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=259.1s	259.1	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=261.3s	261.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 Yes. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=264.8s	264.8	 Really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=265.9s	265.9	 I'm telling her stay as she's doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 Be very methodical when you're introducing new words or phrases to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=271.9s	271.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=275.4s	275.4	 She's doing so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=276.6s	276.6	 See right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=277.4s	277.4	 Now, I asked for too much time there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=279.2s	279.2	 Avoid doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=280.3s	280.3	 Only gradually increase the amount of time you ask them to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=283.6s	283.6	 Don't ask for too much too early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=285.5s	285.5	 A really common beginner mistake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=287.2s	287.2	 OK. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=288.3s	288.3	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=289.3s	289.3	 See, we're showing her how to sit and stay and how to do it voluntarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 No leash, no collar and no force.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=296.3s	296.3	 This is the difference between making your dog do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=299.6s	299.6	 and making them want to do something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=301.5s	301.5	 And it's always good practice to let your dog know when the stay is over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=304.8s	304.8	 OK, come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=306.2s	306.2	 Good job. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=307.9s	307.9	 And that's what a stay should look like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=309.8s	309.8	 Now, most people would stop right here, but we're just getting warmed up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 If you're serious about having a well-trained dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=316.9s	316.9	 you'll need to teach them how to listen to you when they're distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=319.7s	319.7	 So we're going to do a puppy distraction training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=322.5s	322.5	 In general, puppies are really distracted by things that move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=325.9s	325.9	 So if I were to drop that treat, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 she's very likely to get up and go after it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=330.2s	330.2	 So we're going to start off really small with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=333.4s	333.4	 I'm going to show her the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=334.9s	334.9	 I'm just going to move it like that. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=337.1s	337.1	 But stick with me here because we're going to make it much more challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=340.3s	340.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=343.8s	343.8	 So I set the treat on the ground for just a moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=346.2s	346.2	 and I immediately gave it to her before she even had a chance to break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=349.4s	349.4	 This is a good way to show your dog what you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=351.4s	351.4	 rather than correcting them for something you don't want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=354.8s	354.8	 Much more powerful, much more effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=356.8s	356.8	 Let's see if we can raise the bar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=359.1s	359.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=361.4s	361.4	 Yes, good. That was probably twice as long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=365.0s	365.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 And right there, I accidentally moved the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=368.8s	368.8	 and you can see how responsive she was to a moving treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=371.4s	371.4	 So let's see if we can work up to being able to have a moving treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=374.8s	374.8	 in front of her and have her stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=376.4s	376.4	 Don't underestimate how important it is to get your dog to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 while something moves in front of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=381.7s	381.7	 Movement can be very distracting to most dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=384.6s	384.6	 Oh, too far, too far. That's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=386.6s	386.6	 Sometimes you got to try, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 Yes. Wonderful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=390.7s	390.7	 Get this exercise solid and all of your future training will be much easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=394.7s	394.7	 Of course, this is a very basic beginner stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=397.1s	397.1	 In the description, I'll have a video on how to teach your dog a more formal stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=401.4s	401.4	 I'll also have one on teaching them to stay at doorways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=404.1s	404.1	 and not dash out the front door and one on how to teach them to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNz6reMVXY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=407.6s	407.6	 while off leash outside.
