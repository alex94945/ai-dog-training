https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Keep your expectations realistic when it comes to training your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=4.0s	4.0	 Don't think that you can train them in two weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=6.5s	6.5	 How many times have you guys heard me say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 focus on the relationship with your dog first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 and the training takes care of itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=12.2s	12.2	 Too often we look at that the other way around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=14.3s	14.3	 like, let me get the dog trained, then I can focus on a relationship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 I always say it takes two years to train a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=19.1s	19.1	 Not because it takes two years for them to learn the basics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=21.4s	21.4	 but it takes two years for them to gain the life experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 to know what is out there, to become familiar with this planet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=27.9s	27.9	 and its range of experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 So two years for you to let your guard down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=31.8s	31.8	 Maybe that's more what I mean, because we'll take a dog for three weeks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=34.4s	34.4	 and we get them listening pretty well to the basics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=36.6s	36.6	 You had your dogs performing stunts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=38.4s	38.4	 That's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=38.9s	38.9	 Younger than two years, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=40.1s	40.1	 I was on the David Letterman show with Venus when she was 10 months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 But you didn't let your guard down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 I didn't let my guard down, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 Although she was pretty solid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=47.5s	47.5	 I was pretty naive at that time, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 She fortunately was a great dog, but you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=51.4s	51.4	 if you let your guard down with other dogs, people do that way too commonly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=55.7s	55.7	 So I'm fumbling through for two years on that dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_COoaN7YNs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=60&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 if I've taken on a new dog in my life.
