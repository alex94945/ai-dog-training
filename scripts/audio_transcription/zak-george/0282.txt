https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=137.4s	137.4	 exercise a dog early in the day, because they've just woken up,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 going to be much more behaved on a walk because she doesn't have

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 walks will last 45 minutes to an hour or so on these walks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 the emphasis for me is more on exercising her at least on the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 that inertia loves doing on her walks is just looking at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=274.4s	274.4	 squirrels or the ducks or the geese. I mean, this park has so

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=335.4s	335.4	 lie down and settle. Very good. This is one of her favorite

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=352.2s	352.2	 difference. And contrary to what you might think, you don't need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=355.4s	355.4	 to be constantly training your dog all day long. Give them some

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=361.4s	361.4	 this is a time of day when I'd like to get a lot of my own work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=364.1s	364.1	 done. So at some point in the day after she's recovered and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=367.2s	367.2	 she's mentally fresh, I like to focus on doing just general
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=370.4s	370.4	 training here in the house in order to make sure that she's

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=376.7s	376.7	 training session with her is to see if I can get her playing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=379.4s	379.4	 with the toy and you can see she's really ready to interact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=382.2s	382.2	 for it. She'll do all sorts of things. Lie down, play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=388.5s	388.5	 Play dead.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=395.5s	395.5	 there. She loves playing. Go. Keep going. Keep going. Keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=400.3s	400.3	 going. Yes. Good job. Stand. Lie down. Stand. Lie down. Okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=408.3s	408.3	 good job. We haven't done this one in a while. Get your tail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=415.1s	415.1	 Yeah. I mean, the spirit of it is there. She didn't grab it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=419.6s	419.6	 but she's trying. It's really hard for her to grab her tail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=422.1s	422.1	 But let's try. Let's see if we can get lucky here. Get your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=424.8s	424.8	 tail. Keep going. Get it. Get that tail. Get your tail. Get

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=436.1s	436.1	 Good job. Yes. There we go. Stay. Okay, get down. So you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=448.3s	448.3	 you can see she's feeling pretty confident here. She's doing a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=450.7s	450.7	 good job. Then I'll work with her on something new. So one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=453.4s	453.4	 the things that I'm currently trying to teach her is how to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=456.1s	456.1	 a back stall while I move. She's really good at staying up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=459.6s	459.6	 But if I start to move, she gets a little unsteady. Yes, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=464.0s	464.0	 actually quite good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=470.4s	470.4	 Oh, my goodness. Okay, good. Nice job. So that was pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=475.8s	475.8	 I wonder if she can do it while I stand though. That's the harder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=478.1s	478.1	 type of back stall. Stay. So almost good girl. Very good. That
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=485.4s	485.4	 was that was a good try right there. That was her first time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=487.7s	487.7	 holding it. But you can see how she started to get a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=490.4s	490.4	 uneasy. I want to be able to walk around all day long with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=492.9s	492.9	 on my back like that, you know. So let's see if we can practice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=496.4s	496.4	 that. Ready? Stop. Stay. Wait. We're gonna move. Wait. Stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=505.7s	505.7	 So it looks like holding a treat up as a lure seems to really keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=508.9s	508.9	 her focused on getting her a little bit more stabilized. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=511.5s	511.5	 girl. Okay, good job. Nice work. Okay, so inertia is showing some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=516.9s	516.9	 progress on standing on my back while I move around. But we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=519.6s	519.6	 gonna have to practice that a little bit more. One of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=522.2s	522.2	 things that I like to work with her on pretty regularly too is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=524.8s	524.8	 retrieving new and random objects. So for example, I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=528.1s	528.1	 gonna put this toy right here. Stay. It's not moving. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=535.9s	535.9	 Good. Bring it to me. It's a start. That's good. I appreciate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=542.3s	542.3	 that. She's doing well with retrieving the toy. Let me see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=545.4s	545.4	 if she can retrieve something a little more unorthodox. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=552.2s	552.2	 Bring it to me. Let's go. It's a start. I haven't actually worked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=558.0s	558.0	 with inertia on fetching food yet. You can see she really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=561.8s	561.8	 wants to pick it up. But she's also struggling with this inner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=564.9s	564.9	 conflict of but it's food, not a toy. And you know, you might be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=568.9s	568.9	 asking, why is this useful? This is just a really good mental
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=572.3s	572.3	 exercise that can come in very handy later. Maybe if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=575.0s	575.0	 interested in service dog training, this is something that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=581.2s	581.2	 your dog to get you a banana. This is for me. Okay, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=586.6s	586.6	 have some. Lie down. That's pretty good. Here you go. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=593.6s	593.6	 know, it gives me an idea. She likes this so much and her nails
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=597.2s	597.2	 are ready for a trim. I wonder if I can use this to get her to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=600.8s	600.8	 be cooperative on getting a nail trim. Stay. Yeah. So inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=611.9s	611.9	 is very tolerant of her nails being trimmed or dremeled like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=615.3s	615.3	 she doesn't exactly love it, but she puts up with it and she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=618.6s	618.6	 steadily improving on her reaction to it. I mean, who could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=621.3s	621.3	 blame her? It's got to be a little ticklish, right? Since
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=624.0s	624.0	 inertia has so much hair, I like to brush her often as well. Keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=628.2s	628.2	 those tangles out. It's a good time to inspect your dog and see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=632.2s	632.2	 how they're looking overall any issues developing good girl. She
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=636.4s	636.4	 loves it on her chest right here. It's her favorite part. And I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=639.2s	639.2	 like to end our grooming and training sessions like this on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=642.0s	642.0	 positive note, let her go chase her toy. I might even let her run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=645.6s	645.6	 around with that one for a little bit. And now I just like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=648.0s	648.0	 to let her do her own thing, explore, walk around, play with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=651.6s	651.6	 things and just be a dog, you know, Indian inertia will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=654.4s	654.4	 probably have a play session. We'll see how they're doing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=657.0s	657.0	 that. And I'll show you what I'm doing when inertia now much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=660.2s	660.2	 larger than India, or at least taller gets out of control. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=663.6s	663.6	 I get her to calm down on cue, but they get into these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=666.7s	666.7	 wonderful play sessions, but I don't want inertia coming on too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=670.6s	670.6	 strong and being too rough with Indy. You can see Indy, Indy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=674.4s	674.4	 isn't afraid to let inertia know what's up and inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=676.8s	676.8	 definitely respects Indy's elder status. And so this is a balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=681.6s	681.6	 between having the two play together, but making sure that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=684.8s	684.8	 inertia doesn't get too rough with her. Inertia. Indy's done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=689.0s	689.0	 playing. That's enough. Come here. Lie down. Relax. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=694.9s	694.9	 And so the moment she gets a little too rough for my liking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=697.8s	697.8	 there, I'll just intervene and say something like Indy doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=700.9s	700.9	 want to play anymore, or that's enough or whatever. And then I'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=703.9s	703.9	 escort her away by calling her and having her settle down over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=707.2s	707.2	 here and just relax for a second. And then depending on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=710.1s	710.1	 context, sometimes I'll say, okay, go play again, or that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=713.0s	713.0	 enough. We're all done. Just depending on mainly Indy's mood

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UwXfFJ6JzU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=283&pp=iAQB&t=736.8s	736.8	 One of inertia's favorite activities to do throughout the
