https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 So that's what I'm going to show you in today's video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=40.1s	40.1	 And remember when you buy more than one t-shirt, you'll get a great break on shipping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=43.7s	43.7	 I actually came across this video footage from a recent video I shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 You might recall Calliope, the mini Australian shepherd, we did a recent video on how to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 teach your dog not to bark.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 When I first met Calliope, I noticed she was bringing me toy after toy and when I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=60.7s	60.7	 go to play with a toy, she would just start playing tug of war with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 I mean, that's what many dogs do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 It's a very instinctive game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 So how do you teach your dog to let go of a toy when you ask?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=71.7s	71.7	 Well, I recommend that you start with a toy like this, kind of a long rope toy proportionate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=77.1s	77.1	 to the size of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=78.7s	78.7	 It gives you more leverage and sometimes with dogs that are new to playing tug of war, their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=83.1s	83.1	 aim isn't so great, so they might get you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 This will make it a lot easier to play tug of war with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 You can get a rope toy like this and they have several varieties.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=139.1s	139.1	 The first thing to understand about teaching your dog to let go is that there are a number
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=143.6s	143.6	 of ways to get the same result.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=146.9s	146.9	 For example, a popular way that many trainers will teach a dog to let go is as they're tugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=151.7s	151.7	 and not letting go, putting a treat at their nose to distract them so that they then let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 Now, I want to discourage many of you from doing this for this reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=160.9s	160.9	 The whole idea of teaching our dogs a good game of tug of war or a good game of fetch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 is so that we can find a way to bring that energy to the surface so that we can get them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=170.7s	170.7	 to release it on our terms and our schedule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=173.7s	173.7	 As you can see, Kalipe is really into the toy here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 She's not even considering letting it go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=178.8s	178.8	 She's really determined to win this game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=181.5s	181.5	 So if your dog is really emphatically tugging and you want them to let go and they're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 no, I'm not going to let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 I want to win this game of tug of war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 All you have to do is say no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=191.1s	191.1	 And every time we say no, there needs to be a consequence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=193.9s	193.9	 And that consequence should never be any type of severe punishment or severe discipline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 In this case, the corrective action is simply making the toy very boring and still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 Because what does your dog want more than anything in the world when they're pulling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=209.5s	209.5	 back on a toy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 They want you to keep pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=212.3s	212.3	 This is the part over here that keeps your dog going when you're trying to pull it away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=216.2s	216.2	 from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 By doing this, getting it with both hands and really locking it in position, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=220.7s	220.7	 telling your dog, no, I'm not going to play that game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=224.4s	224.4	 And so your dog now is forced to go through a process of, okay, well, this isn't exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 what I want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=230.9s	230.9	 And you'll see that just about every dog in the world will make the decision to let go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 momentarily just to see what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=238.1s	238.1	 When your dog lets go, even for a moment, drop that toy, let go of it, let them immediately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=243.7s	243.7	 go after it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 That's what you've got to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=245.7s	245.7	 In other words, letting them know that if you'll just let go for a moment, I will give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=249.7s	249.7	 you the toy right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=252.1s	252.1	 You should see results on this within one to three training sessions for most dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 Now, you need to be prepared to sit there and hold it for several minutes in some cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=261.4s	261.4	 Usually 30 seconds is all you need, but it's important to have a patient attitude.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=265.6s	265.6	 Your attitude needs to be, I'll sit here all day long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=269.1s	269.1	 If you're frustrated and you're thinking about getting it out to then put behind your back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 or put up or throw or whatever you're going to do with it, then your dog knows you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=276.3s	276.3	 in a hurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=277.3s	277.3	 When your dog knows you're in a hurry, they're not going to be quite as cooperative with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=281.1s	281.1	 you, it seems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=282.1s	282.1	 So anyway, that is the secret to teaching your dog to let go of any toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 I want you guys to try this at home and let me know if you have any questions in the comments

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 Now, some dogs, if they're not exercised, will have a tougher time with this and it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=295.8s	295.8	 may take even longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=297.3s	297.3	 It's always best to get your dog's energy out of them before you teach them new concepts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=302.0s	302.0	 that will make just about everything easier.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=313.1s	313.1	 toy very boring and immobile for a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=316.5s	316.5	 When they do let go, even if it's for a split second, don't keep the toy away from them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=320.6s	320.6	 give it right back to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfuFbmUc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=322.3s	322.3	 Repeat this process several times in a row and you should notice pretty rapid success
