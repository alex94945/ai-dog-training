https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 In today's video, you're going to see world-class dog training team Chris Perandi and his incredible dog Vinny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 If you want to teach your dog something new and do it efficiently, your currency has to be top notch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=10.9s	10.9	 Personally, I think minimally processed treats are best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 I use these Pupford freeze-dried beef liver treats all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 They're 95% beef liver and 5% protein.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 That helps keep them nice and formed and together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=22.4s	22.4	 These freeze-dried sweet potato treats are 100% sweet potatoes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 Indy's on a low protein diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 I love these for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 But dogs like them either way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=31.3s	31.3	 The reason freeze-dried treats have a major advantage is they're still really highly palatable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=36.4s	36.4	 but all the moisture has been completely removed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=38.9s	38.9	 So they keep all at room temperature, but they still taste really good and retain all of their nutrients.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 So you have two very different treats here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=45.1s	45.1	 One is meat, one is sweet potato.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 I like kind of mixing them together to really keep the rewards varied throughout the training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 It kind of keeps the dog guessing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=52.8s	52.8	 You get so many in a bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 You can do so much training with these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=55.7s	55.7	 You can use Pupford treats for dogs of all ages and all breeds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=58.9s	58.9	 and you can get them right now at the link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=61.8s	61.8	 And when you subscribe for auto shipments, you get an additional discount,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=77.3s	77.3	 So Chris, you and I used to work together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=79.1s	79.1	 It's been too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=79.9s	79.9	 I'm so glad you're here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Me too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=81.6s	81.6	 It's an honor to be here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 So tell my YouTube audience what you're about and what you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 Well, I travel all over the United States performing with my stunt dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=87.8s	87.8	 I actually have 12 dogs all trained to do amazing tricks and stunts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=91.1s	91.1	 flying disc, agility, all sorts of dog sports, and all using positive training methods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=95.7s	95.7	 But we tour around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=96.3s	96.3	 We perform for like halftime shows, the NFL, the NBA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=99.1s	99.1	 We do state fairs, county fairs, theme parks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=101.3s	101.3	 Even have a performing arts theater show called the Stunt Dog Experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 And what I'm very proud of is the fact that I just released my first book,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=107.6s	107.6	 The Big Book of Tricks for the Best Dog Ever, and Vinny is on the cover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=110.4s	110.4	 It was over 118 tricks and stunts that you can train your dog to do at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=114.1s	114.1	 Doesn't matter the age, breed, or size, all using positive reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 So Chris, why don't you show us something that's kind of easy to teach,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 that anyone at home could probably teach their dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=121.4s	121.4	 Absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 We're going to have him do a little sit pretty today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=124.6s	124.6	 I'm going to use the treat as a lure, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=126.2s	126.2	 I'm just going to lure it over his nose into the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=128.4s	128.4	 Yes, very good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 It's very simple, and just make it fun and positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 And if they're having a hard time, sometimes you can have them rest their arm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 on your arm and encourage them just to kind of sit up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=136.3s	136.3	 get that treat as a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=137.2s	137.2	 At the same time, I'll say, Vinny, sit pretty, and I'll give them that treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=139.4s	139.4	 Pretty soon, what you can do is you can start fading out the treat in your hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=143.1s	143.1	 and fade in what we call an air cookie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=144.7s	144.7	 What you're trying to do is fade out, having to lure him with the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 constantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 And I've noticed when I've taught sit pretty in the past,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=149.1s	149.1	 you really have to build their muscle memory up over a period of time so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=151.7s	151.7	 they can get that balance right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=152.8s	152.8	 Yeah, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=153.9s	153.9	 Take it really slow at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=155.3s	155.3	 Get a good vet check up, of course, on your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=156.9s	156.9	 and make sure their hips are good and their back and all that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=159.1s	159.1	 And of course, we don't start doing things like this until they get a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=161.7s	161.7	 bit older.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 So once he has the sit pretty down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 we can start teaching him to stand on his hind legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=165.8s	165.8	 I just lure him up into the standing position, and if he needs some help,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 I'll just put my arm out and let him rest his paws on my arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 Nice work, Vinny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 Excellent job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 Yes, very good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 I'll do that in some duration and just start building that core strength.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=176.8s	176.8	 And then the next step is once he's up, I'll start luring him around and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 following that treat and get that treat as a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=182.3s	182.3	 Yes, very good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=183.5s	183.5	 And let him rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=184.1s	184.1	 Keep the training sessions short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=185.5s	185.5	 You don't want to burn him out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=186.5s	186.5	 That's a really good example of how you can take an existing trick and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 start to add a little complexity to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=192.8s	192.8	 And it's all about your attitude and how excited you are with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=195.7s	195.7	 They feed off of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=196.7s	196.7	 You got to get excited with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 Like Vinny, pretty, yes, good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=200.4s	200.4	 You see my voice pattern changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=201.6s	201.6	 I get excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=202.4s	202.4	 He feeds off that energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=203.7s	203.7	 What is the flashiest version of this trick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=205.8s	205.8	 Well, right now he is actually pretty good on his hind legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=208.5s	208.5	 In fact, without even using the lure, I can just use the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=211.1s	211.1	 Vinny, on two, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 And he will dance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=214.2s	214.2	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=214.7s	214.7	 Around me without me having to turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=215.9s	215.9	 At first, of course, I'll turn with them when I'm first training them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 And back up, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 Excellent job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=223.0s	223.0	 That was so fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=223.8s	223.8	 You did so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=224.6s	224.6	 Make sure you give your dog lots of love and affection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 That goes a long way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=227.5s	227.5	 Yeah, it does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 My dogs are my pets first, performers second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=230.2s	230.2	 We want to make sure that they're having the time of their life when they're out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=232.5s	232.5	 there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=232.7s	232.7	 I know when you're performing, one of the flashiest tricks out there is a back stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=236.4s	236.4	 That's where dogs stance on your back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 It's one of the easiest things to teach, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=239.8s	239.8	 It's pretty easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 It's actually a lot easier if you have a partner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=242.2s	242.2	 OK, tell me what to do, Chris.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=243.9s	243.9	 Spread your legs open just a little bit so he can get up to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=247.6s	247.6	 That sounds so bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=251.8s	251.8	 All right, just go ahead and get down low as you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=253.6s	253.6	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=253.8s	253.8	 And I'm going to get Vinny behind you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 And he is going to try to jump up on your back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=256.8s	256.8	 I'm going to lure him up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=257.8s	257.8	 Now, you can either do it from the side or from the back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=259.5s	259.5	 At first, just have him put his front two paws on your back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 And he's going to get that reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=263.2s	263.2	 If you don't have a partner, some of that can help you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=264.9s	264.9	 You can start by encouraging your dog to jump up on a chair or an ottoman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 And then get close to that ottoman and encourage them to come up and put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 their paws on your back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=270.8s	270.8	 So now that Vinny's got his front paws up there, I'm going to try to lure him all the way up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 Come on, Vinny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=274.3s	274.3	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=274.8s	274.8	 Oh, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=275.4s	275.4	 Very good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 He'll get that treat as a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=277.2s	277.2	 And sometimes they won't be confident enough to stand at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 They might want to lay down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=281.2s	281.2	 And that's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 Do what's natural for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=283.4s	283.4	 And make it fun and make it positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=285.1s	285.1	 Once your dog has a sit pretty down and you got him up on your back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 you can encourage them to sit pretty on the back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 That was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=292.8s	292.8	 When you teach your dog amazing tricks like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=295.2s	295.2	 you're really building such intricate, amazing communication with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=298.9s	298.9	 that spills over into every aspect of their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=301.6s	301.6	 What do you want to show us next?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=302.6s	302.6	 Well, I was thinking maybe we should show how to teach your dog to take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 The key is to try to get your dog standing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=307.7s	307.7	 The easiest way to get your dog to stand up when they're sitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=309.8s	309.8	 is just walk towards them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 Now he's in the stand position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 And now what I'm going to do is get down next to him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 put my arm right under his belly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=315.5s	315.5	 And then you're going to show him that treat and try to encourage them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=317.5s	317.5	 to get the treat into the bow position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=319.6s	319.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=320.0s	320.0	 And very good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=320.8s	320.8	 As soon as he makes any effort to kind of go down with his front paws,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=323.7s	323.7	 give him that cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=324.5s	324.5	 Yes, or click the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=325.6s	325.6	 So the next step obviously is to fade out the cookie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=327.6s	327.6	 And then what I'll do is start relieving pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=329.4s	329.4	 that's underneath his belly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=330.5s	330.5	 Start moving my arm down so it's not right there, barely touching him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=333.4s	333.4	 If he starts to go down, then I'll just give him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=334.8s	334.8	 a little tap underneath his belly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=336.1s	336.1	 And then the next step is basically getting over in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 Because you want him to take a bow when you're up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=340.9s	340.9	 You don't want to have to be down there all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=342.2s	342.2	 So I'll be up here in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=343.3s	343.3	 And I'll encourage him to follow that treat into the bow position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=346.1s	346.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=346.4s	346.4	 And that's once he understands that he's got to keep his bottom up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=348.8s	348.8	 Next step is basically the finished product.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=350.7s	350.7	 I like to finish it with a bow with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=352.4s	352.4	 Take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=353.2s	353.2	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=353.7s	353.7	 You guys are going to be blown away by this next trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=356.2s	356.2	 Very few dogs in the world can jump rope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=358.9s	358.9	 Vinny is one of them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=359.6s	359.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=360.0s	360.0	 Now with our book out, I think there's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=361.5s	361.5	 to be a lot more dogs jumping rope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=362.8s	362.8	 If your dog is a natural jumper, it's going to be really easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=365.5s	365.5	 If they're not a natural jumper, it might take a little more time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=367.8s	367.8	 But I do believe that you can positively train your dog to jump rope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=370.6s	370.6	 The first step is using their favorite toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=372.3s	372.3	 So no rope at all yet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=373.3s	373.3	 No rope at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=374.0s	374.0	 You want to get them jumping at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 So I'm going to try to encourage him to jump up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=377.2s	377.2	 And he's not wanting to jump up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=378.3s	378.3	 So maybe if I jump with him, Vinny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=380.2s	380.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=380.9s	380.9	 You don't get that toy as a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=382.2s	382.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=382.5s	382.5	 Excellent job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=383.4s	383.4	 Whatever motivates your dog, be animated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=385.2s	385.2	 Be excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=385.7s	385.7	 The more excited you are, the more they're going to feed off that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=387.9s	387.9	 Right, Vinny?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=388.9s	388.9	 I'm going to fade out actually having to jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2UFCnHpd0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=337&pp=iAQB&t=390.4s	390.4	 And of course, you want to keep this training session short too.
