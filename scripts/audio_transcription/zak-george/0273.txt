https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 In today's episode, I'm going to attempt to teach Inertia to do whatever I ask, no matter how I ask it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 This should be interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=8.3s	8.3	 I train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=9.3s	9.3	 This is my new dog, and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=15.8s	15.8	 You can start from the beginning, or you can pick up anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=18.8s	18.8	 Subscribe and hit the bell notification so you never miss an episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=22.1s	22.1	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect, your results will forever remain in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=27.9s	27.9	 This is Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=29.6s	29.6	 Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 Today's lesson is going to be a good one, and you guys are always asking me about my favorite treats to use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 And remember, it's what your dog loves that matters most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=42.1s	42.1	 And one of Inertia's clear favorites are Pupford treats, freeze-dried salmon treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 These are actually brand new, so I'm excited to see what Inertia thinks of these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=49.9s	49.9	 What I like about Pupford treats is they're always made with just one or a very small amount of ingredients.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 You've got approximately 475 treats in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=58.3s	58.3	 That's a lot of training potential in one bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 Yes, I like that. Nice indoor bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=63.7s	63.7	 So these treats are obviously from their training line, but they have their engage line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=67.8s	67.8	 So these are meant to last a little bit longer and just give your dog something to, well, engage with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 These are the turbo tendons. You can see why they call them turbo tendons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 Then they have the reward line for when you want to give your dog an extra big reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 Check out their beef jerky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=81.7s	81.7	 I also use a lot of the freeze-dried sweet potatoes so that I'm not too protein heavy on my treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 Inertia will like literally walk like a person for these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 Bottom line for best results when working with your dog, you want to have a ton of different options for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 With their pack deals, you can get a great deal on their multipacks of their different treats and chews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 I'm going to have a link in the description where you can check out all of Pupford's amazing treats and their pack deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=105.3s	105.3	 Your dog is going to love you for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=107.4s	107.4	 Okay, clearly Inertia can't wait to train, so I think it's time to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 Let's go, girl. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=112.3s	112.3	 One of the things that I hope to test today with Inertia is how well she actually understands me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 See, dogs really zone into certain cues we give them when we're communicating with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 For example, many dogs will sit when you just hold up a treat like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=126.1s	126.1	 So they learn that that simple act of holding up a treat and sitting equals them getting the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=131.3s	131.3	 But if you just say the word sit and you don't give them the hand signal, they may have no clue what you mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=136.5s	136.5	 Therefore, it's important for dogs to understand both hand signals and the spoken word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 So the obvious question you might have is why does my dog need to understand both hand signals and verbal requests?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 For example, maybe you've arrived home with groceries, your hands are full and you can't really give them a hand signal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 and you might want to tell them to sit or stay or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 Or conversely, you might be engaged in conversation and you may want to just give your dog that subtle hand signal to just calm down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=161.3s	161.3	 lie down and chill out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 Now, in Inertia's case, she's really clued into motions and very predisposed to hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=168.7s	168.7	 I think that's because we use a lot of body language when we're teaching dogs and a lot of luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=172.9s	172.9	 So it's more natural for most dogs to pay attention to things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=176.4s	176.4	 Let me ask Inertia to do a series of behaviors using only hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=187.7s	187.7	 Okay, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=189.5s	189.5	 Not bad, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=190.2s	190.2	 So we did a sit, a lie down, a stand back into a sit and into a sit pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=196.3s	196.3	 And so she did all of that right there with just hand signals without being lured without having to have a treat in my hand at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=201.7s	201.7	 Right now, let's see what happens when I just say the words and don't use the hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=205.7s	205.7	 Sit, lie down, stand, sit, pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 Okay, not bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=216.4s	216.4	 Pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 So she's doing really well there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 You can see those are good examples of how she can differentiate between both the hand signal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 and the verbal cues without using a lure at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=226.6s	226.6	 And so until very recently, actually, she was very dependent on a hand signal for sit pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=231.8s	231.8	 So she's doing really well there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=233.5s	233.5	 But when it comes to getting her to play dead, she's so highly reliant on the hand motion of play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=240.7s	240.7	 By the way, if you're wondering which hand signals to use, I find that that really varies from dog to dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=245.9s	245.9	 So in my experience, when I'm luring a dog into a specific position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=249.3s	249.3	 I then focus on creating hand signals that are custom to that dog where they seem to really respond.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=255.5s	255.5	 It's worth pointing out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=256.3s	256.3	 I'm not using a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=257.5s	257.5	 Play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 Very nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=260.2s	260.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=261.3s	261.3	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=262.3s	262.3	 But if I just say play dead, watch what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=264.6s	264.6	 Play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=266.5s	266.5	 She's a little confused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=267.3s	267.3	 She's like, you want me to speak?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=269.1s	269.1	 Play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=270.5s	270.5	 That's not what I'm asking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=271.9s	271.9	 A little frustration on her part right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=274.3s	274.3	 One more time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=275.2s	275.2	 Hey, play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=280.1s	280.1	 So she's starting to get the idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=282.1s	282.1	 I want to bring a little bit more attention to the phrase play dead and less attention to the hand signal in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=288.5s	288.5	 It's a really intricate, delicate process and you'll need to find your own version of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=292.1s	292.1	 But I'll show you what I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=293.3s	293.3	 Play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=294.5s	294.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=295.4s	295.4	 So that was a fairly obvious hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=297.4s	297.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=297.9s	297.9	 Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=298.8s	298.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=301.0s	301.0	 Play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=301.9s	301.9	 It may not look like much right there, but I'm focused on de-emphasizing the hand signal a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=308.0s	308.0	 until I can fade it out into nothing basically while saying the word play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=314.4s	314.4	 Now see, and that really is the secret there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=316.6s	316.6	 We've done play dead four or five times in a row in this training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=319.8s	319.8	 So she's starting to anticipate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=321.5s	321.5	 You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=322.1s	322.1	 Okay, come alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=323.1s	323.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=323.5s	323.5	 And play dead.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=327.9s	327.9	 Just to make sure that my body position isn't the thing that's cueing or you might notice I'm on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 Let me see what happens if I stand up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=334.8s	334.8	 Stay and play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=340.7s	340.7	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=341.3s	341.3	 Okay, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=342.3s	342.3	 The more I feel like she's understanding it, the more I'll withhold when she does something I don't ask for because I don't want her to bark every time she plays dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=349.7s	349.7	 Play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=350.8s	350.8	 Oh, there it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=351.7s	351.7	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=356.3s	356.3	 Okay, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=358.1s	358.1	 Play dead.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=362.8s	362.8	 So there she's really starting to generalize the difference between the hand signal and the verbal request.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=368.4s	368.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=369.5s	369.5	 Now release her from the play dead there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=371.1s	371.1	 Thanks for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=371.8s	371.8	 So let's see if we can add that to that little routine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=374.0s	374.0	 She did a second ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=375.3s	375.3	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=382.2s	382.2	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=383.3s	383.3	 Play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=385.1s	385.1	 So you can see, okay, when I use a lot of visual language right there that she's super receptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=391.4s	391.4	 So my goal is to see if I can get her to do that same thing without all of the body language and all of the hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=397.8s	397.8	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=401.5s	401.5	 Stand.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=406.5s	406.5	 So I'm going to kind of take a step back here and just acknowledge that I like those first three behaviors and then we'll see if we can troubleshoot and work through that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=413.7s	413.7	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=420.1s	420.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=420.7s	420.7	 So I'm going to use the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=421.7s	421.7	 Stand.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=424.7s	424.7	 Having to remind her there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=425.7s	425.7	 So I took a step back and I used the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=428.5s	428.5	 We've got birds and squirrels and lots of people exercising this morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=432.4s	432.4	 So, you know, we are adding a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=434.0s	434.0	 I know she would do better on this if we were in my living room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=436.9s	436.9	 For the sake of providing good examples, I really wanted to do this lesson out here to really show you how at least we try to work through this confusion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=444.2s	444.2	 One of the things I find that helps when a dog is starting to get a little bored with the training session is to pick up my energy and try to make things a little bit more playful and exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=453.0s	453.0	 I think dogs really appreciate authenticity and we tend to be at our most genuine when we're playful as our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=460.1s	460.1	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=474.6s	474.6	 Yeah, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=476.0s	476.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=476.9s	476.9	 Gonna give her extra special reward there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=478.9s	478.9	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=479.9s	479.9	 So you can see, I mean, that made a huge difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=481.5s	481.5	 We were struggling there for a little bit because I'm focused on being a YouTube host perhaps and sometimes you just have to let go and be ridiculous with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=490.0s	490.0	 That is the secret.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=491.3s	491.3	 I'm told that I didn't even realize it, but my producer and wife, Bree, pointed out that I actually did give a subtle hand signal on lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=499.2s	499.2	 I didn't even realize it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=501.5s	501.5	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=518.3s	518.3	 Lie down.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=522.0s	522.0	 Play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=525.5s	525.5	 This is still a little messy and this is something we're still working on right here, but that's the point of this series to show you those things as we work through them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=533.0s	533.0	 And not talk about how we did something, but rather show you how we're doing the things that we're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=538.1s	538.1	 This is a 30 foot lead I'm using and we're going to focus on our next bit of training now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=542.5s	542.5	 Now we're going to try this the other way around now for something like come when called where I've noticed she's more receptive to the verbal request of inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=550.4s	550.4	 Come more so than she is to the hand signal, which in this case I would like to be or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=556.2s	556.2	 Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=557.5s	557.5	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=559.5s	559.5	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=562.9s	562.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=565.1s	565.1	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=567.1s	567.1	 So there as I was walking away, I called her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=569.6s	569.6	 She's really generalizing the word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=571.5s	571.5	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=575.7s	575.7	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=577.9s	577.9	 That's a good example of where she's actually more reliable on the verbal request than she is on the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=583.3s	583.3	 I think a lot of that has to do with when we teach our dogs to come very or at least the way I teach a dog to come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=587.9s	587.9	 I'll use a really animated exciting voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=590.9s	590.9	 So she's really clued in to that exciting tone over time and I've evolved it into something a little bit more normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=597.6s	597.6	 So I don't look like a total lunatic when calling my dog in public just as a side note to as I work on her training out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=603.8s	603.8	 I'm being tolerant of the minor anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=605.8s	605.8	 I'm seeing the barking because I don't want to pick all of my battles at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=609.6s	609.6	 Now watch what I do here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=610.5s	610.5	 I'm still going to call her but I'm going to start phasing in the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=613.3s	613.3	 So inertia come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=616.9s	616.9	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=617.8s	617.8	 Just a little bit of hand motion there to let her know what I want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=621.1s	621.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=621.6s	621.6	 I'm going to practice this a few times organically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=623.7s	623.7	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=626.7s	626.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=627.5s	627.5	 Love when she goes to my side like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=630.2s	630.2	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=631.8s	631.8	 Now let me try just the hand signal and see what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=637.0s	637.0	 See that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=639.7s	639.7	 She's like what are you talking about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=641.4s	641.4	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=642.8s	642.8	 So I want to be a little bit more deliberate right there about explaining to her what that hand signal means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=647.8s	647.8	 I'm going to do it at a relatively short range here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=650.7s	650.7	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=651.7s	651.7	 So remember you're trying to shift that emphasis from what you're actually saying verbally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=660.3s	660.3	 That's pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=661.5s	661.5	 Pretty good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=663.2s	663.2	 Do that a few more times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=672.3s	672.3	 Little more ensure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=673.8s	673.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=674.7s	674.7	 So I really want to let her know that was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=677.1s	677.1	 I'm going to give her an extra special reward here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=681.9s	681.9	 Haha look and you can see right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=683.7s	683.7	 She did it a little bit more eagerly than the last time little more sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=687.4s	687.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=688.0s	688.0	 Be nice to be able to just say hey like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=689.8s	689.8	 Let's see if she responds to that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=692.2s	692.2	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=692.6s	692.6	 She's a she thinks she knows and she does come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=696.0s	696.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=696.7s	696.7	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=698.2s	698.2	 So there I was able not only did I not have to do this kind of silly looking hand signal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=702.4s	702.4	 which would be okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=703.2s	703.2	 I was able to make it a little more socially acceptable, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=708.6s	708.6	 Yeah, good work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=712.4s	712.4	 That's something I'll continue to work on because ideally I want her really running to me see when I call her verbally inertia come she comes much quicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds17JmX8G7I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=274&pp=iAQB&t=720.5s	720.5	 You see that if you're having any issues with your dog, make sure you do check out my book guide to a well-behaved dog.
