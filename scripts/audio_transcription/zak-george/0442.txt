https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=2.8s	2.8	 You can see the team is doing their thing over here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=16.3s	16.3	 We shot a video with Rue about the importance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=18.4s	18.4	 of rewarding with toys.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 especially if you have puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 Because with puppies, it's so important to really get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=25.3s	25.3	 them engaged with play, especially when they're young
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=27.4s	27.4	 and they're really bitey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 So that can be a lot of fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 The second video that we made, I'm very excited about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=32.5s	32.5	 because I've been wanting to make it for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=34.5s	34.5	 It's about service dogs and the difference between service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=37.4s	37.4	 dogs and therapy dogs and emotional support animals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=40.4s	40.4	 He works so hard today, Rue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 He did so much fetching and so much playing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 When you're teaching a dog, it's important to exercise them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 But that mental simulation is extra critical for dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=55.3s	55.3	 because, I mean, think how you feel after you study

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 You can satisfy a dog mentally and physically just by doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=62.5s	62.5	 basic obedience training with them too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 If you look at the eye of Alpha Centauri in that,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=216.6s	216.6	 Ah, we just did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=218.5s	218.5	 By any chance, can you make a video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=219.8s	219.8	 about how to be prepared for a puppy?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 Olivia Coolgamer said that her dog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 Well, it's hard to know exactly what to tell you there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 Olivia, without a little bit more context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 But dogs generally like to interact with each other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 and go and check each other out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=237.5s	237.5	 If you're trying to get your dog under control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 around another dog, there's no shortcut to that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=241.8s	241.8	 except for practice and really making sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 that your dog knows how to pay attention to you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 So I have lots of videos on teaching your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=250.9s	250.9	 how to listen to you in distracting situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=253.8s	253.8	 Do you guys want to see some puppy feet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=255.4s	255.4	 Aren't they cute?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=256.2s	256.2	 You can see that Zach and I have different priorities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 Carme Ferrandes said she wants to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=261.6s	261.6	 how to teach her dog the same request in separate languages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=266.8s	266.8	 That's a good idea for a video,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 but I suppose it's not much different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 than really just teaching a dog, say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=271.8s	271.8	 the difference between drop it and let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=274.5s	274.5	 Dogs are capable of understanding the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=277.5s	277.5	 or different phrases for the same action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=279.7s	279.7	 So it's just a matter of working with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=282.1s	282.1	 I think you have enough information to get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=284.2s	284.2	 Shark Zero Gamer, boy, we have so many gamers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=286.5s	286.5	 on this channel, ask how do I know my dog's energy level?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=289.7s	289.7	 I think that's a really good question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=291.2s	291.2	 So I talk about that in my book right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=293.4s	293.4	 So level one dog is typically a dog that's very low key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=297.3s	297.3	 You can't really get them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=298.4s	298.4	 they're like this, but all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=300.1s	300.1	 You know what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=300.9s	300.9	 A level two dog is a dog that can be like this sometimes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=303.4s	303.4	 but can also get peppy and play with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 Like Rue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=306.5s	306.5	 Yes, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=307.4s	307.4	 Rue would be a good example of a level two dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 though it may not look like it right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=311.4s	311.4	 A level three dog is a dog that's just always on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=314.1s	314.1	 and they just really like to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=315.7s	315.7	 And of course, most dogs are gonna fall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 somewhere in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=318.2s	318.2	 You can have a level 1.5 or 2.6 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=320.9s	320.9	 But understanding energy level is really, really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=323.7s	323.7	 So great question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=324.9s	324.9	 Baby Love basically is asking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=327.2s	327.2	 Zach, I know that you recommend training dogs separately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 before integrating them and then asking them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=331.5s	331.5	 to listen to you once together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=333.2s	333.2	 because it's really distracting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=334.7s	334.7	 if you're trying to train two dogs at once
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=336.3s	336.3	 and you're not really gonna get anywhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=337.5s	337.5	 if you try to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=338.7s	338.7	 So it's important to have each dog really well behaved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 and well trained around distractions and things like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=345.5s	345.5	 before you start integrating your dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=347.2s	347.2	 and asking them to listen to you together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=349.2s	349.2	 So how do you do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=350.4s	350.4	 Well, it's important to have a really reliable down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=353.1s	353.1	 So with my own dogs, for example, when they were younger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=355.5s	355.5	 I would have one dog hold their down stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=357.6s	357.6	 while I work with the other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=359.1s	359.1	 And since that down stay on the older dog, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=362.1s	362.1	 is so reliable, then I don't have to worry about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=364.4s	364.4	 that dog getting up and interfering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=365.8s	365.8	 with the training session and saying, hey, what about me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=367.9s	367.9	 If your dog who's holding their down stay does get up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=370.9s	370.9	 just escort them back, have them stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=373.1s	373.1	 Waste25sec basically is asking for videos for dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=379.2s	379.2	 who live in apartments, because some things are different,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=382.2s	382.2	 like house training them and things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=384.3s	384.3	 You guys tell me in the comments below,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=385.6s	385.6	 do you wanna see more videos like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 We'll consider it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=388.1s	388.1	 But in general, my advice would be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=390.3s	390.3	 it's not that different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=391.5s	391.5	 You may have to go to a public park to work with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=393.9s	393.9	 to give them some outdoor training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=395.3s	395.3	 or do some distraction training on sidewalks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=398.5s	398.5	 I think you can really adapt a lot of the advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=400.4s	400.4	 that we give you if you do live in a more urban setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=402.8s	402.8	 But as you see in our training videos,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=404.2s	404.2	 we do training in a really contained area,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=406.5s	406.5	 right here in a small backyard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=408.5s	408.5	 So it's not that different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=409.9s	409.9	 But I do understand there are some more nuanced things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=412.2s	412.2	 when you do live in an apartment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=413.2s	413.2	 that can make training challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=414.7s	414.7	 So I think maybe we'll consider that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDna3A-XMI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=443&pp=iAQB&t=416.4s	416.4	 Click thumbs up if you enjoyed today's video,
