https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Welcome to the dog training revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 We just picked up Cupid the rescue dog who is currently available for adoption from Zeus' rescue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 Cupid, what's this? I've got a surprise for you. It's a pup box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 Check out the dentisaurus. This is really good for eight month old dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 It has this kind of texture to it that helps clean your dog's teeth as they chew on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Talk about a serious tug toy. Look at this. I mean that is tough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 I've never seen a tug toy quite like this. This is really cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 Basically you just add this to your dog's water. It helps prevent plaque and tartar and it gives them fresher breath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 They also gave us this finger brush and toothpaste kit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 Cupid, you have such beautiful brand new teeth. I think we should show you how to get your teeth brushed today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 Pup box is an age specific subscription box where they give you toys and treats based on your dog's age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 Plus other items that are specifically aimed to help you train your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 And they give you a guide every single month so that you know what to work on with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 Chicken heart treats. Let's see what Cupid thinks of them. How appropriate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 Pup box is giving viewers of this video 50% off of their first pup box when you sign up for a 3-6 or 12 month subscription.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 Just go to pupbox.com slash Zach and enter discount code ZACH. I'll have a link in the description.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 And my Instagram followers are the first to know of any special top secret dog training news that I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 Check out my new book, Guide to a Well Behaved Dog. How many of you have ever attempted to brush your dog's teeth?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 You know what a chore it can be. Most dogs don't like having a brush stuck in their mouth and scrubbing around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 And they're usually less than cooperative. By age three, so many dogs already have teeth problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 It's really important to do this. This will save you money on your vet bills and just keep your dog looking good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 At eight months old, Cupid has these brand new teeth and it's time to get her comfortable with getting those teeth brushed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 But the thing to keep in mind is you don't want to go super quick and just start brushing your dog's teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 You're likely to create a complex. We're going to work up to using the finger brush here in a minute, but we're going to start with peanut butter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 So first I want to let Cupid know I've got something really good. I'm just going to let her lick this peanut butter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 I want to get Cupid comfortable with having my fingers stuck in her mouth. And so we're going to go pretty slow here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 See how I'm not having to restrain her? See how she's being very cooperative right here? Good. Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 Now, if your dog were to get uncomfortable, that probably means you're moving too quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 But really, you just want them comfortable with having their teeth touched, having the upper bit of their mouth touched, their gums touched, just everything over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 This may take a few training sessions. The important thing is not to rush it. So this is doing a couple of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 She's getting desensitized by letting me touch the inside of her mouth. And we're also creating that favorable association with that action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 In this case, she's getting peanut butter, which she's very into. So by implementing desensitizing and conditioning, we're really getting her to be very cooperative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 Pup Box sent us this finger brush and toothpaste kit. You put your finger in it like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 So it makes it really easy to be accurate when you're brushing your dog's teeth. And this one's extra safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 That big end makes it impossible to swallow. And by the way, do you see how optimistic she is right now? See how she's trying to grab the toothbrush?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 I actually love this. How many dogs would put their ears back and dread it if they had that bad association?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 Your dog does have a bad association. Just take a step back and follow the steps we're doing today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 Be prepared to go extra slow. Now I'm going to actually put some peanut butter on here. See how I'm just tapping the inside of her mouth here, tapping her teeth and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 Just getting her willingly coming up to it. See how I'm not having to go to her at all. She's coming to me here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 All right, so now let's try actual dog toothpaste. OK, boy, she's all about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 I'm able to actually start brushing away at her. We see if she lets me touch her here. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 See how I'm lifting up her gums for just a minute there. And so you're just focused on doing it little by little here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 And the main thing is that you're not having to restrain your dog. I really want her voluntarily doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 And it's a little sloppy right now, but this is how you get started. Oh, look at those white teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 Her very first experience with the toothbrush. With your own dog, just start with tapping a single tooth if you have to and working up to being able to brush that one tooth over a few days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 Before you know it, as long as you go slow, your dog will be very accepting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 Over time, your goal is to brush all of your dog's teeth in a circular motion focused on their gum line and do this every three days or so with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 And just by frequently practicing and getting your dog looking forward to it, you should be successful with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 You need to learn how to let go of stuff. I think we should teach that now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 You'll obviously understand that rewarding your dog is key when you're training them, but it would be a huge mistake to limit your rewards to only food rewards,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 especially with a dog like Cupid, because you see how much she wants to play. She's so energetic and so engaged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 We want to keep her that way and nothing keeps her engaged like clay, it seems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=275.0s	275.0	 She's got a really good tug of war going on with her pup box toy here, but you have to be able to work to being able to have your dog let go and work for a brief tug session as an actual reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 So, for example, you might want to tell your dog to sit or lie down and then reward them with a brief tug session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 But you want to have really good structure to your game of tug of war here, because if she won't let go when you ask, then that's bound to make your training session very clunky and less productive than it could otherwise be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=301.0s	301.0	 So in addition to having your treats readily available during that first year or two of training, you also want to have things like tug toys or balls readily available as well so that you can promptly reward your dog when they're in a playful mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 Nothing accelerates training progress like play. Trust me on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 In order to teach your dog to let go of something, one of the fastest ways to do this is to just make the toy boring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=322.0s	322.0	 So instead of pulling dogs like this pulling motion, that's what they find really exciting about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 But if you just go ahead and keep it real still, she would stop biting for just a brief moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 And we want to let her know, wow, when you do that, I'll bring the toy back to life immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=335.0s	335.0	 And notice I'm not like hiding it behind my back. I'm not prying it out of her mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 None of that will teach your dog how to let go. You have to really teach them to think, let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=344.0s	344.0	 Yes. Good. That was a more disciplined let go. You can see she's starting to reason through this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=349.0s	349.0	 Just a moment ago, she was very reluctant to let go. And now she's almost instantly into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 Cubits doing really well with this. Now, if it takes a little bit longer with your own dog, that's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 If you're having a really tough time with this, you could always put a treat at your dog's nose to get them to let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=363.0s	363.0	 However, that's likely to really quell their desire to play, which I think can work against you sometimes when you're training your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=369.0s	369.0	 But, you know, sometimes you may need to resort to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 Once your dog has mastered this whole game of tug and let go, you can use this to reward your dog during training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=378.0s	378.0	 Sit. Not going to repeat myself. I'm just going to wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 You know what? I'll take it. I'll take it because it was an effort to comply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 She was a little confused, even though I asked for a sit and she kind of went into that down and roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 I still want to let her know that I appreciate that she's trying to think and work with me here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=394.0s	394.0	 Sit. Yes. Get it. Good. Go on. Get it. Good. Get it. All right. Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=401.0s	401.0	 A lot of people really resist rewarding their dog with play or with tug like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 You're just talking about a three second game of tug. Remember, your dog chooses what they love.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=410.0s	410.0	 You don't get to choose that. And if your dog loves play, you need to be rewarding with play more often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=414.0s	414.0	 If you're serious about getting results and maximizing your training time with them, you can even use toys to lure your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 Sometimes let's see if we can teach spin. Get it. Yes. Tug, tug, tug. Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=427.0s	427.0	 Look at that drive. She is a good dog. She's going to be good for someone who has a lot of time for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=432.0s	432.0	 This isn't the kind of dog you want to leave at home for eight to ten hours a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=435.0s	435.0	 She needs a lot of engagement from people, but she's going to be one of those dogs that's incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PmzjSNEx4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=342&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 They can just do amazing things if someone's got the time for her.
