https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=3.7s	3.7	 He's throwing in a shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 He's thinking about rollover and I'm just going to ignore those right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=8.3s	8.3	 It's common when you're training a dog for them to get confused and to start offering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=11.6s	11.6	 every trick they know at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=14.2s	14.2	 So you really want to use your judgment there and withhold rewards for tricks that you're

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 I noticed a lot of people tend to get discouraged by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=24.1s	24.1	 They think their dog is going backwards on their training when actually this is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=27.8s	27.8	 a normal part of training any new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=30.2s	30.2	 So it's probably a sign you're on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6rVLQurRo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=43&pp=iAQB&t=32.5s	32.5	 Just work through it by being really disciplined on when you reward your dog.
