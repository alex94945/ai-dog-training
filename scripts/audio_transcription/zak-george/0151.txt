https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 the thing is puppies aren't born knowing exactly where they're supposed to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=104.2s	104.2	 their business. I mean, most of us prefer for them to go outside,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=110.2s	110.2	 As we learned with biscuits quite vividly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=112.9s	112.9	 No.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 I was so embarrassed at certain parts of this series, Bri, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 but that's what we're about. We're about being honest, real,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 transparent and showing you the struggles that we go through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=131.3s	131.3	 Those really are the most interesting parts of these dog training series that we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 do. I think for years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=135.8s	135.8	 I've done plenty of videos on what the ideal situation is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=139.3s	139.3	 but so often things are not ideal. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=142.7s	142.7	 So the first major point about house training should be very obvious control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 your dog's environment. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 they can't go poop in your dining room if they can't get to your dining room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=152.6s	152.6	 Right? But see,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=153.3s	153.3	 our overall goal is to eventually teach our dog that our house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=157.2s	157.2	 including the dining room is also their house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 And the thing we're banking on is that dogs typically long-term don't want to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=165.8s	165.8	 their business in places that they identify as their primary residence. But,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=170.4s	170.4	 you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 it can take a while for a dog to generalize a big human house as their living
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 space. So for a puppy like biscuits, she might be like, okay, the bedroom,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 that's where I sleep at night. That's kind of my primary area out here in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=183.2s	183.2	 living room. I guess I can do my business there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=185.3s	185.3	 It's not like I have to sleep in it or anything. So in her mind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=187.9s	187.9	 that living room very well could be what we would think of as a front yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=191.6s	191.6	 Here, come on, let's go over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 So generally the game plan is to slowly give your dog access to the entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=199.2s	199.2	 house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=199.5s	199.5	 Initially keeping their primary living area very small and keeping them in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=204.7s	204.7	 very tightly controlled situation throughout the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=207.6s	207.6	 like having them on leash as you walk with them about the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=211.1s	211.1	 That way you're more clued in if they're about to have an accident and you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=214.5s	214.5	 to give them more than enough opportunities to relieve themselves in places that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 you deem appropriate. In hindsight,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=221.5s	221.5	 I kind of messed up on both of those things. In other words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=225.1s	225.1	 I think I probably gave biscuits a little bit too much freedom in our living
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 room and I probably didn't let her outside often enough. So with biscuits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 we had one big area in our Alaska house where we could easily supervise her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=236.4s	236.4	 And I think even that was probably giving her too much freedom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=240.1s	240.1	 If you want to have your dog off leash in those initial phases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=242.9s	242.9	 you would need to be in a much smaller environment. This is what I've learned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 I like bathroom sized environment. Otherwise you really need to have them on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=250.4s	250.4	 leash. So clearly this way your puppy can't wander off and pee or poop when your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 attention becomes divided. And also when you have your puppy on leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 you really get to know them and it's easier to zone in on when they have to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=262.8s	262.8	 Maybe they'll jump up on your leg or maybe they'll gently pull you towards the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=267.9s	267.9	 but almost all of them will behave in a way that is easy to correlate with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=272.5s	272.5	 having to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=273.5s	273.5	 Another great way to control the environment is by having baby gates up so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=276.8s	276.8	 you can keep the area smaller and make it easier for you to supervise them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 It's impossible for us to supervise our dogs all the time though. So for that reason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=283.8s	283.8	 you have to have a puppy proofed area where you can tolerate accidents should they

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=289.7s	289.7	 You really want to go out of your way to make sure that your puppy is so extra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=294.4s	294.4	 comfortable in whatever area you choose because increasing their anxiety isn't

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=301.6s	301.6	 she didn't take to her crate quite as easily as I had hoped,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=305.9s	305.9	 which complicated matters and made it more difficult to control her environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=310.9s	310.9	 So giving her a really good quality chew really helped her spend lots of time in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=316.3s	316.3	 the crate where she was enjoying herself.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=321.1s	321.1	 If her crate became an area where she could be like,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=325.5s	325.5	 then we could start turning the tide and reducing that anxiety. So in biscuits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=329.4s	329.4	 case she really loved those turbo tenants, which were designed for giant dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=333.6s	333.6	 which kind of makes a lot of sense knowing what we know now about her breed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=336.9s	336.9	 But anyway, more of that in a second. Those come from Pupford,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=339.7s	339.7	 by the way, they're super long lasting, kind of important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 You don't want your dog going through a chew in 30 seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=345.3s	345.3	 I use Pupford treats all the time when I'm doing training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=347.9s	347.9	 whether it's potty training or otherwise, because they're also super high quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=351.1s	351.1	 They're very unlike other treats that you're going to find on the shelf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=354.3s	354.3	 Even if Pupford wasn't one of our sponsors, I would be loaded up on those products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 Also, I know many of you have taken my 30 day perfect pup program through Pupford
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 as well, which is all completely free. If you've got a puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=364.1s	364.1	 I had you in mind when we designed that course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=366.7s	366.7	 I'll have information on everything Pupford below,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=369.0s	369.0	 but ultimately over the three weeks that Biscuits was with us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=371.9s	371.9	 we did get her comfortable with being in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=373.9s	373.9	 And you can see that series and how we went about that process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=376.5s	376.5	 If you're struggling with that, the whole logic of using a smaller crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=380.1s	380.1	 is that it's easier for a dog to generalize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=382.5s	382.5	 Oh, this is where I sleep, so I won't do my business in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 And then the second you let them out, you can take them to where you want them to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 versus a big room like with Biscuits where she was like, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 we play over here all the time, but over there on that side of the living room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=396.6s	396.6	 That's OK. That looks like a great place for a bathroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=400.2s	400.2	 Yep, it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=401.9s	401.9	 And seriously, we want to be very sparing about how we use the crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 like no more than three or four hours at a time for a young puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=408.0s	408.0	 And generally, there's an exception with overnight where it's probably OK
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=411.6s	411.6	 to leave them in there for a good eight or nine hours,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=413.7s	413.7	 unless they wake you up telling you they got to do their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 The way that I utilize a crate is to keep them safe for short periods of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=419.8s	419.8	 when I can't directly supervise them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=421.8s	421.8	 Now, if you have to go to work for like eight hours,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=423.5s	423.5	 it's a good idea to come home at lunch if you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=425.3s	425.3	 or have a friend or relative come and let them out to give them those opportunities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=428.7s	428.7	 Now, in Biscuits case, she just had a lot of anxiety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=431.2s	431.2	 that we had to work on slowly with the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=433.1s	433.1	 But in most people's case, if your dog doesn't like being in the crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=436.8s	436.8	 and you've tried for, say, up to a week to get them comfortable with it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=440.1s	440.1	 there's a good chance that they are not sufficiently physically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=444.1s	444.1	 and mentally exercised, and that helps a ton.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=447.2s	447.2	 So taking a one hour walk before bedtime with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=450.2s	450.2	 can be a great way to prime them to do well in their crate overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=454.5s	454.5	 But no, not in Biscuits case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=456.2s	456.2	 She couldn't make my job easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=458.0s	458.0	 And in her case, it turned out to be OK, because most of her accidents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=460.7s	460.7	 weren't really happening overnight because she was on my chest most of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=465.4s	465.4	 What are you looking for?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=466.4s	466.4	 It's just funny what's happening in the bed right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=469.8s	469.8	 Nothing's happening. The dog is in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=473.8s	473.8	 Me? As I thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=475.7s	475.7	 I don't regret that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=477.2s	477.2	 Have you ever cuddled with a dog like Biscuits?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=479.5s	479.5	 I think I must have added at least two years to my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=482.2s	482.2	 So even though I was having trouble potty training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=484.0s	484.0	 or I really felt like my quality of life overnight was dramatically increasing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=490.2s	490.2	 I mean, was it really that important to potty train or anyway?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=493.8s	493.8	 Yeah, just come clean, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=495.4s	495.4	 I was slacking and I paid the price for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=498.0s	498.0	 Yeah, you did sleep in bed with her for like two thirds of the series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=501.5s	501.5	 So I really had to do some critical thinking and analyze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=505.5s	505.5	 All right, how are we going to get this dog back on track with house training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=508.9s	508.9	 I mean, I remember thinking, Zach, you're a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=511.3s	511.3	 You're smarter than this little yellow dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=515.2s	515.2	 So I decided to put her crate near my bed at night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=518.7s	518.7	 So that way she could see that I was at least there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=520.9s	520.9	 And that seemed to make her more comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=522.9s	522.9	 She looks happy as a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=524.3s	524.3	 When you have a puppy, you've got to be prepared to let them out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=526.7s	526.7	 in the middle of the night if they start crying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=528.6s	528.6	 In the beginning, it's normal to have to do this up to about four times overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=532.6s	532.6	 But usually twice with most of the puppies that I've really done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=536.0s	536.0	 these in-depth training series with has been pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=538.5s	538.5	 When you do take a puppy out for a break,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=540.8s	540.8	 be prepared to be out there for like five or 10 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=543.4s	543.4	 Five or 10 minutes on a potty break can be the most boring thing in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=546.7s	546.7	 And it feels like forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=548.0s	548.0	 Honestly, guys, this is an area where I could have done a lot better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=553.4s	553.4	 Usually I will take a puppy out once an hour in the beginning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=556.9s	556.9	 just to give them lots of opportunities, maybe even every 30 to 45 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=560.6s	560.6	 And then after a few days of that, once I get to know the puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=563.3s	563.3	 I might let them out every couple of hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=565.4s	565.4	 And then hopefully within the first 10 days, every three to four hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=568.8s	568.8	 Prior to this training series, I visited Alaska the last two summers and it was beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=575.0s	575.0	 It started snowing like all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=577.8s	577.8	 No one told me there was so much snow in Alaska.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=580.9s	580.9	 They should put that on the Internet or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=583.2s	583.2	 So people know I don't like being cold in the snow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=588.7s	588.7	 And so with biscuits, rather than letting her out once an hour,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=591.4s	591.4	 I tried to stretch that to 90 minutes and it just got out of hand too quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=596.2s	596.2	 And I wasn't giving her enough opportunities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=598.6s	598.6	 I knew it, I knew it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=599.6s	599.6	 And so I was reminded of one of my own dog training laws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=602.7s	602.7	 If you want success, you need to be relentlessly consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=606.4s	606.4	 You know, it should go without saying that we don't punish potty accidents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=609.9s	609.9	 Again, if our dogs do their business in the house, it means we need to do something different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=614.5s	614.5	 If you're having potty training relapses that seem to come out of nowhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=617.6s	617.6	 there's a good chance there's a medical issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=619.4s	619.4	 I can't blame that on biscuits because we had her checked out thoroughly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=622.9s	622.9	 and there was no evidence that there was anything medical causing her issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=626.3s	626.3	 Just a lack of consistency on my part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=628.7s	628.7	 Now, we were able to catch biscuits in the act several times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=632.0s	632.0	 which is not quite as good as getting them out ahead of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=635.7s	635.7	 but probably better than letting them finish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=638.7s	638.7	 So if you can catch them right before they do it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=641.2s	641.2	 you can pick them up and escort them to the proper place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=646.6s	646.6	 She's running to the bathtub because this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=650.0s	650.0	 If it's already too late and the accident happened,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=651.6s	651.6	 we just clean it up and do better next time. Just period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=654.8s	654.8	 There is no yelling at them or scolding them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=657.6s	657.6	 That's not going to be productive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=659.0s	659.0	 Another thing that came into play with biscuits was when she was staying with us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=662.2s	662.2	 it was a completely new environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=664.1s	664.1	 You might have noticed this with your own dog, or if you haven't understand that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=668.5s	668.5	 like a change in environment can often cause a regression in house training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=673.3s	673.3	 That's normal. So do what we did and just go back to basics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=676.2s	676.2	 So ultimately with biscuits, she was doing fine by the time that she left us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=680.6s	680.6	 and she was able to go three or four hours pretty easily without an accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=684.2s	684.2	 And we were very consistent about letting her out. So fortunately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=687.3s	687.3	 we were able to get back on track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=688.8s	688.8	 We do have another loose end to wrap up with the series because you guys called
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=691.9s	691.9	 us out big time on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=693.7s	693.7	 We never told you what biscuits breed makeup was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=697.9s	697.9	 This is one of our favorite things to do with these dogs that we work with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=701.2s	701.2	 like knowing their DNA is amazing and be honest and tell me what you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=705.9s	705.9	 or thought biscuits breed was. I thought she was a Chihuahua mix basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=710.9s	710.9	 That's what she looks like, right? She looks like a little Chihuahua dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=713.4s	713.4	 but she's a puppy too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=714.6s	714.6	 And almost all young puppies kind of look like Chihuahuas if they're young enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=718.1s	718.1	 What's interesting, particularly about these Alaska dogs is they're,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=721.2s	721.2	 at least in her case, she came from a remote village of all of the dogs we have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=725.8s	725.8	 ever tested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=727.1s	727.1	 Biscuits has the most number of breeds inside of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=732.0s	732.0	 And the moment you've been waiting for,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=734.2s	734.2	 she's 5.2% West Highland White Terrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=739.0s	739.0	 I mean only 5%. You can see why that's not obvious, but pretty cool. I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=742.6s	742.6	 how did a West Highland White Terrier end up in an Alaskan village?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=745.8s	745.8	 This is a huge surprise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=747.6s	747.6	 She's 6.7% German Shepherd dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=757.6s	757.6	 11.3% Maltese.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=772.4s	772.4	 Ah, you got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=774.1s	774.1	 Yes. Surprise, surprise. She is 12.5% Super Mutt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=778.0s	778.0	 which is where they have so many different trace amounts of different dog breeds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=781.7s	781.7	 I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=782.2s	782.2	 And they still give you an estimate of what that Super Mutt is made of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=785.7s	785.7	 They give you a nice breakdown here. The test we like to use is in bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=788.8s	788.8	 They not only tell you the breed makeup,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=790.9s	790.9	 but they also tell you a lot of health concerns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=793.3s	793.3	 I love them because we get so much more data than any other DNA test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=797.6s	797.6	 With these DNA tests, it's easy to fixate on, okay, the breed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=800.8s	800.8	 but they also give you health information,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t68E7g4D4dU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=152&pp=iAQB&t=806.7s	806.7	 the cost of it is less than a vet visit.
