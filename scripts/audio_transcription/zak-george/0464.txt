https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I'm going to make sure that if you've got an internet connection, you're going to have everything you need to teach your dog absolutely free.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=11.4s	11.4	 I'd like to add even more content to this channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 If you'd like to help us with that, I'll have a link in the description where you can help out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 And to say thank you to those of you that do support us over there, we've got some fun rewards like signed frisbees, even signed copies of my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=23.8s	23.8	 Thank you so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=25.7s	25.7	 One of the most common questions about puppies is, when do you start training them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=29.9s	29.9	 Today, Flurry, the lab puppy and I are going to tell you everything you need to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=34.3s	34.3	 Click thumbs up for Flurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=35.8s	35.8	 Make sure you're subscribed to my channel for all sorts of free dog training videos and pick up a copy of my book, Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=42.1s	42.1	 You can either read it or listen to it now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=44.5s	44.5	 The book is a great companion to these videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=46.7s	46.7	 So how old should your dog be before you start training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 The fact is you can start training a dog at absolutely any age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 There is zero truth to the myth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=55.1s	55.1	 You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=57.1s	57.1	 But if you're asking this question, there's a lot more you need to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 From the moment you get your dog, regardless of their age, you should be teaching them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=63.9s	63.9	 Ideally, the youngest you would get a puppy is at about 10 weeks old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 That's a perfect time to start training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 But so is 10 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 The relationship you have with your dog is going to be the foundation of all of your future success with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=75.8s	75.8	 Your very first priority should be to bond with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 And if you do that, the communication between you two is going to blossom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=82.7s	82.7	 Today, Flurry and I are going to show you several great ways to emphasize trust,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=86.3s	86.3	 build a strong relationship, and build communication with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 We got some work to do, don't we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 A couple of days ago, I had Flurry over here and I noticed that he was a little nervous about going down the stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 Because I know he could be nervous about these stairs, I'm going to seize this opportunity to build some trust with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 And that's one of the cornerstones of teaching any dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 Now, for safety reasons, we're going to start here at the bottom of the stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=109.9s	109.9	 That's probably going to be a lot less daunting to Flurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=112.5s	112.5	 Remember, your dog has some say in how fast training should be as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=116.4s	116.4	 So, for example, if Flurry decides that today isn't the day where he's comfortable to learn how to go down the stairs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 I'm going to accept that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 I'm going to make sure that Flurry doesn't fall down the stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=125.1s	125.1	 So I'm going to secure him on his leash and harness here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=127.1s	127.1	 And I've got some great treats that he really loves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=129.8s	129.8	 I'm going to see if I can just lure him down one step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 See, he's a little reluctant there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=133.7s	133.7	 You see that? Doesn't want to take that step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 You can understand. I mean, it's got to be a little weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 Why is the ground changing level?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=140.1s	140.1	 Right there, he just lifted his foot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=141.7s	141.7	 I love that he's trying there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 Look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=145.1s	145.1	 All right. That's one interesting loophole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=147.1s	147.1	 I'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=148.1s	148.1	 The fact is, he's engaged with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=149.6s	149.6	 He's trying right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 Plus, I want him to know that I'm here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=152.8s	152.8	 He can trust me and that he doesn't need to worry about falling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 And I'm not going to let anything bad happen to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 You want to go this way?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=160.5s	160.5	 Hey, he made it somehow to the next stair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 Good job, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=166.5s	166.5	 So he's made it from one stair to the other, albeit a bit unconventionally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=170.4s	170.4	 But that's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 I'm not picky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 Remember, the bigger picture here is we're emphasizing trust between one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 I'm going to make sure I'm here to support him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=179.1s	179.1	 Look at this, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=183.9s	183.9	 So he's handled a couple of stairs there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 Now, let's see if we can get him to go all the way down to the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 We'll give him an extra big reward there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 Let's try it a bit faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 Yes. Right away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=195.6s	195.6	 Just like I thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=197.3s	197.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=198.5s	198.5	 I think he's learning the stairs wonderfully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=201.1s	201.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=201.7s	201.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=202.8s	202.8	 Really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=203.7s	203.7	 So I'm just thrilled with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=205.2s	205.2	 You can't ask for any better than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=206.7s	206.7	 That's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=207.6s	207.6	 Good job, Flurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=208.6s	208.6	 Part of knowing when it's the right time to teach your puppy is being able to read them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=212.5s	212.5	 If you notice that your dog isn't particularly enthusiastic about learning something new,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=216.8s	216.8	 then that might be your cue to take a step back and be a little bit more patient when working with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=220.9s	220.9	 until they're feeling a little more comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=223.1s	223.1	 Why are you biting my hand?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=224.5s	224.5	 Ouch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=225.6s	225.6	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 Now that we're down here, let's have some fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=228.4s	228.4	 By far, the fastest way to get your dog to bond with you is to get them playing with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 And that's not just my opinion either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=234.4s	234.4	 A study done on the physiological effects of human-animal interactions has shown that levels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=238.7s	238.7	 of the bonding hormone oxytocin increase for both the human and the dog during interactions like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=244.6s	244.6	 When your puppy is having fun, good things happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=247.3s	247.3	 This may not look much like training, but actually, this is one of the most powerful things you can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 to get your dog eagerly excited about you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 Remember, the two raw ingredients for teaching a good game of fetch are chase and tug of war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 Come on, let's go. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=263.1s	263.1	 And right there, we just got him to do his first fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=266.2s	266.2	 That was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=267.3s	267.3	 And just look at his body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 You can tell he's having a blast right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=270.3s	270.3	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=270.9s	270.9	 Make sure you let him win a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=272.5s	272.5	 He'll be a fetching machine in no time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=274.7s	274.7	 Since every puppy will have different needs, you should make sure that you talk to your vet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=277.8s	277.8	 about the level of exercise that's safe for your puppy as he grows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=280.9s	280.9	 But as a general rule, the younger your puppy is, the more careful you need to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=284.7s	284.7	 Flurry, that was excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 Now, I think it's time to go inside and play a brain game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=288.8s	288.8	 Whoa, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 All right, let's see if we can go up the stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=292.3s	292.3	 Yeah, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=294.1s	294.1	 You did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=294.9s	294.9	 When you have a dog as young as Flurry, you're not going to have a ton of mutual communication yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=299.4s	299.4	 So how do we begin to build communication with a dog who's had little to virtually no training at all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=304.8s	304.8	 Well, I know that Flurry likes to play and I know he likes food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=308.6s	308.6	 So let's see if we can use some treats to build some more sustained interest in interacting with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=313.3s	313.3	 As important as exercise is lots of mental stimulation for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=316.9s	316.9	 So we're going to play a little game with Flurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=319.7s	319.7	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 I knew that would wake you up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 Now we're going to put the treat right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 I'm going to cover it up right there and let's see if he can figure out where the treat went.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 This is going to be interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=330.8s	330.8	 What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=333.4s	333.4	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=335.5s	335.5	 And hey, nice work, bud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=337.3s	337.3	 And he found the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=338.3s	338.3	 This is a great game for teaching him how to brainstorm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=340.9s	340.9	 We're going to put the treat there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=342.5s	342.5	 Cover it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=344.1s	344.1	 Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=344.7s	344.7	 That's nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=345.8s	345.8	 Now, let's see if he puts two and two together here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 I'm going to put a treat inside of here and just do that now and let's see if he figures it out again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=353.2s	353.2	 This is kind of on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=356.1s	356.1	 Maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 There's the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=357.8s	357.8	 You got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=358.6s	358.6	 All right, chunky burrito.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=359.8s	359.8	 You ready to do this with two cups now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=362.1s	362.1	 Let's see if he can do it with both of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=365.1s	365.1	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=365.4s	365.4	 Well, he seems to have forgotten about the treat here and he seems to prefer the cup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=369.6s	369.6	 As long as he's having a good time, I'm happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=372.2s	372.2	 Now it might look like Flurry is just getting treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=374.5s	374.5	 But what else is happening here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=376.4s	376.4	 Look, he's engaging me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=377.5s	377.5	 He's interested in working with me right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=380.2s	380.2	 Whenever your puppy is paying attention to you like this, it's a golden opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=384.6s	384.6	 And I don't want to squander that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=385.8s	385.8	 I want to seize that opportunity to really build some communication with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=389.2s	389.2	 By playing a simple game like this, you're increasing your overall bond and communication simultaneously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 because you're teaching your puppy that looking at you can make his life awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 And since he's paying attention to you, that probably means he's receptive to learning new things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 Give Flurry a thumbs up if you think he did a good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=406.8s	406.8	 Thank you so much to our patrons who made this video possible this month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=410.2s	410.2	 And also make sure you're subscribed to my channel and pick up a copy of my book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=413.3s	413.3	 for the most thorough dog training experience that I know how to give.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=416.4s	416.4	 Good job, Flurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOEXAn9Hj20&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=465&pp=iAQB&t=417.3s	417.3	 You did a great job.
