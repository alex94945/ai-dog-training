https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=260.4s	260.4	 A lot of people attribute breed stereotypes to certain behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 For example, with border collies and Aussies, I'll get a lot of emails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=267.5s	267.5	 My dog keeps nipping my heels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 So it must be because they're a herding dog that they do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=273.3s	273.3	 He nips your heels, doesn't he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=274.8s	274.8	 He's not a herding dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 You know, all puppies do that, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=279.2s	279.2	 But there are going to be things that are unique in many cases to breeds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=282.6s	282.6	 I don't mean to diminish that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=284.5s	284.5	 Jonathan, why don't you show me some of the stuff you've taught him and let's get low

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=290.4s	290.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=291.4s	291.4	 Have you taught him up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 Usually with a dog this young, you want to be very liberal in your rewards and letting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=297.4s	297.4	 them know what you like often just to get the habits established.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=300.3s	300.3	 But that was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=301.3s	301.3	 Leave it and look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=303.3s	303.3	 Such an essential skill for dogs to learn, but it's not that common for them to learn

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=309.5s	309.5	 Why is that so impressive?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=311.1s	311.1	 Because we're throwing something that our dog really loves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=313.5s	313.5	 A turkey on the ground and he's getting the attention on him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=316.5s	316.5	 You have to do this before you can expect your dog to not chase another cat or squirrel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=320.3s	320.3	 or dog down the street.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 It might look like we're teaching sit, lie down, up, leave it and watch me, but the bigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=328.1s	328.1	 picture is we're teaching our dog how to listen to us, how to understand us, how to build

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=334.6s	334.6	 If you can build overall communication, then you can teach your dog to do anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=338.4s	338.4	 Every dog needs to know how to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=339.7s	339.7	 It's the most important skill in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=341.2s	341.2	 So I'm going to kind of give you an idea of how to introduce stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=344.4s	344.4	 Now I'll have videos in the description that will give you more information on this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=350.5s	350.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=351.5s	351.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=352.5s	352.5	 Get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=353.5s	353.5	 And I told him he could get up there just to make sure he knew the stay was over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 You want to master a one second stay before you start walking away, before you start asking

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=372.8s	372.8	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=373.8s	373.8	 I was even able to pet him there without him biting me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=374.8s	374.8	 Stay is very important, but so is come when called.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=376.7s	376.7	 Now I'll have a video in the description that will help you keep it happy, keep it engaging,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=380.8s	380.8	 encourage your dog to want to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=382.9s	382.9	 That's the trick with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=384.3s	384.3	 Start at a nice short distance like this to make it easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=387.2s	387.2	 The easier you make new concepts to your dog, the better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 High pitched voice can really, really help a lot too to encourage your dog to come to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=395.6s	395.6	 When you can see him perk up, he's like, Hey, what's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=397.2s	397.2	 I definitely want to go running to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=399.5s	399.5	 You get it any way you can, as long as you're motivating them to do it from within.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=403.2s	403.2	 When you're making it work as well, letting them know with the turkey that you love it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=408.0s	408.0	 This will make him more likely to repeat this behavior in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_VcLRmCoI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=579&pp=iAQB&t=411.0s	411.0	 If you were to try and run past you, you have a model leash.
