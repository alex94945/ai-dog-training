https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=340.3s	340.3	 They also want a playmate for their other dog Shuggy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=342.9s	342.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=343.9s	343.9	 Who loves other dogs and I would love to see Chop end up in a home with another dog that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 likes to play like he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=350.2s	350.2	 But first I want Steven and Sarah to meet Chop and see how they like them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=354.8s	354.8	 We invited them over so that we could spend some time together and get to know one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=359.3s	359.3	 I wanted to make sure that Sarah and Steven had as much time as they wanted with Chop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=363.8s	363.8	 I mean, this really is a huge decision for everyone involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=368.6s	368.6	 And so far, I'd say that Chop really seems to like them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=372.4s	372.4	 Everything is going well so far, so I think we should take things outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 I've got to say the more time that we spend together, the better I'm feeling about these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=379.9s	379.9	 guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=380.9s	380.9	 I'm really seeing the potential for Chop to have an unbelievable life with Sarah and Steven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=386.9s	386.9	 And then it was time for Shuggy, their dog, to meet Chop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=391.0s	391.0	 And I'm thinking this is going to go pretty smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=392.4s	392.4	 Chop loves dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=393.7s	393.7	 He's been hitting it off great with inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=395.8s	395.8	 I mean, his biggest problem is that he loves dogs so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=398.7s	398.7	 So they got their dog Shuggy out of the car and we let the dogs investigate one another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=402.7s	402.7	 through our fence first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 They seemed pretty interested in one another and look at those play bowels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=408.9s	408.9	 After a couple of minutes of this, we decided to let Shuggy through the fence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=412.4s	412.4	 Shuggy ran in and was really excited to meet everyone, but Chop really wanted to interact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=417.0s	417.0	 with Shuggy to say the least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=419.2s	419.2	 Then it felt like to me a nightmare scenario unfolded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=425.6s	425.6	 Here we are in the final stages of this series and I felt like in that moment, every bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=434.7s	434.7	 of training I had done with him was meaningless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=437.7s	437.7	 And even though he didn't bite Shuggy and no harm was done, obviously there are things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=442.3s	442.3	 that could have been done better here and I think we all need to learn from this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=446.7s	446.7	 And look, I want to be the first one to take responsibility here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=449.7s	449.7	 Anytime something like this happens, it is on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=452.5s	452.5	 I'm the one in charge and the one who should be teaching Chop not to interact with another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=456.8s	456.8	 dog like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=458.1s	458.1	 First and foremost, I shouldn't have had Shuggy in a position to not see Chop approaching her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=462.9s	462.9	 I really think that Chop just got way too overexcited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=467.1s	467.1	 Ran right over Shuggy thinking that he could play however he wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=471.3s	471.3	 I think that he just was unsure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=473.1s	473.1	 I don't think he was like feeling vicious or anything, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=476.6s	476.6	 From what I know of him, I agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=478.7s	478.7	 Now I know some of you might be quick to say that the reason we saw Chop behave like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=482.8s	482.8	 is because we haven't been allowing him to interact in public very much with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=487.4s	487.4	 But remember that is by design because there's a time and there's a place to interact with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=491.2s	491.2	 dogs and in public while on leash is not the ideal place to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=495.7s	495.7	 So I was kind of shaken up by this because I really, really wanted to work with these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=500.9s	500.9	 people if they want him, if they determine this is the right dog for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=504.8s	504.8	 As you can tell, they are two people who are going to give their life to this dog and commit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=510.3s	510.3	 to training him and just loving him and everything you want for in a family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=514.7s	514.7	 At this point, I'm basically expecting them just to be like, bye, I'm gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=519.5s	519.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=520.5s	520.5	 Thanks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=521.5s	521.5	 Right, thanks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=522.5s	522.5	 Probably not going to work out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=523.5s	523.5	 I'm going to meet you and your scary dog, but I'm going to move on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=526.5s	526.5	 But Sarah and Stephen stayed to talk with us about what had happened and they agreed with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=531.9s	531.9	 Shuggy was definitely startled by Chop's less than polite greeting and that it may have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=536.7s	536.7	 just been a poor first impression.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=538.5s	538.5	 And at this point, we really took some time to reevaluate and determine whether it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=543.2s	543.2	 appropriate or even fair to the dogs to try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=546.9s	546.9	 And we decided to go about it differently and give the dogs another shot once they had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=550.8s	550.8	 a chance to calm down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=552.2s	552.2	 This time we moved much slower and gave them even more time to get to know each other through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=556.8s	556.8	 the fence first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=558.2s	558.2	 And this is much more of what I was expecting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=560.9s	560.9	 That's a look I've seen Chop give inertia a thousand times when he really wants to play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=564.9s	564.9	 with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=565.9s	565.9	 This time we put a muzzle on Chop to be extra safe and we brought Shuggy into the yard again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=570.3s	570.3	 but we made sure to give her a minute to get her bearings this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=573.8s	573.8	 Because they were both looking happy and ready to play, we let them give it a go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=577.4s	577.4	 And this is the Chop I expected to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=580.5s	580.5	 They did well for several minutes, even though Chop was a little distracted by his muzzle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=585.2s	585.2	 Since he and Shuggy seemed so much more relaxed and both of them seemed really comfortable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=589.2s	589.2	 I decided to take off Chop's muzzle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=591.5s	591.5	 And just like that, they were like a match made in heaven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=594.4s	594.4	 So while things could have gone smoother, this was definitely a good recovery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=599.0s	599.0	 And look, it doesn't necessarily go this smoothly every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=602.3s	602.3	 In many cases, I wouldn't even attempt another interaction after an introduction like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=607.4s	607.4	 at least not on the same day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=608.9s	608.9	 But every case is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=610.8s	610.8	 And in this particular instance, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, I thought it was okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=615.0s	615.0	 to try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=616.0s	616.0	 In the end, they got along so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=617.8s	617.8	 But I know from experience, having had a dog who's been in altercations before, that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=623.2s	623.2	 the one thing you remember about that day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=625.7s	625.7	 And I am just really afraid that we may have messed this up for Chop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=629.6s	629.6	 I really want this to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=631.0s	631.0	 I would sincerely feel quite guilty if he misses out on a home like this, because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=637.4s	637.4	 didn't prepare him to behave correctly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=641.2s	641.2	 So we did hear from Sarah and Stephen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=643.6s	643.6	 And after thinking it over, they really want to adopt Chop, if it's best for Chop and Shuggy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=649.8s	649.8	 As much as we think they're great, and as much as we love the fact that they love Chop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=654.6s	654.6	 what matters most is whether those two dogs are going to get along.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=658.3s	658.3	 So we thought it would be a good idea to get some more data and see how Chop and Shuggy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=663.1s	663.1	 would do together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=664.1s	664.1	 We still have to do a home check anyway to make sure that they have a great place for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=668.2s	668.2	 Chop to live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmnm91OALsM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=168&pp=iAQB&t=669.2s	669.2	 We are on our way right now to go do a home check for Chop to see if this place has everything
