https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 I heard Susan Garrett say recently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=6.8s	6.8	 I love that saying because that hits the nail on the head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=9.6s	9.6	 That would be the main problem in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=12.1s	12.1	 The entitlement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=13.7s	13.7	 That's really what it comes to with aversive dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=16.5s	16.5	 It is an entitlement that you are owed a dog listening to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=20.7s	20.7	 even if that means you need to use aversive dog training techniques.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 And not saying it's ineffective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 but it's just what a less than ideal way to look at the relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdpgYpMnAM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=38&pp=iAQB&t=33.5s	33.5	 between a person and a dog.
