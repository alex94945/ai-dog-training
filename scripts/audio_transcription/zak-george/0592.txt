https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=8.6s	8.6	 She's a puppy on how to not steal food off of the counter or off of the table or how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 to steal anything else she's not supposed to have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 Now she's still really young and she's still learning, but I'm going to try and give you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 What I'm going to be going over today is what I like to call a real life leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=32.8s	32.8	 It's one thing for our dogs to leave something alone during a training exercise, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=36.3s	36.3	 quite another to have them leave it alone when it really counts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 How good is your dog about leaving things alone and not stealing food off the counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=43.6s	43.6	 or off the kitchen table?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 A prerequisite to this is that you have taught your dog a basic leave it where you can drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=50.1s	50.1	 a treat in front of them and they'll leave it alone at pretty close range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=53.4s	53.4	 If you haven't taught that, I have an excellent video in the description of this video that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=63.9s	63.9	 We have a thriving community of positive dog trainers and everyday dog lovers over there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=68.5s	68.5	 as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=72.8s	72.8	 teach and train our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=74.9s	74.9	 Now let's go inside and meet Elizabeth and Chloe and see if we can solve this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=80.6s	80.6	 I'm here with Elizabeth right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 She is a proud mom of Chloe and actually several other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=86.6s	86.6	 You guys are very dedicated to animal rescue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 What issues are you having with Chloe as far as taking food when she's not supposed to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 It doesn't matter what's on the counter, whatever kind of food is up there, she'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=96.2s	96.2	 Tell me how Chloe is doing like on a basic leave it as a training exercise, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=100.2s	100.2	 a bit easier than an actual leave it alone if it's on the counter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=104.2s	104.2	 So I've noticed that Chloe still does really well with the training by herself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=108.6s	108.6	 She's getting better with real household objects if that makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=111.6s	111.6	 So she'll bring in a sock and I'll tell her to leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Why don't we go ahead and get her warmed up with a basic leave it, see how she's doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=118.9s	118.9	 What I'm looking for here is to see that Chloe is good about leaving it alone when we drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=123.6s	123.6	 it in front of her before we up the ante, before we make it harder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=128.6s	128.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 And notice how she looked at you for guidance there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 I love it when they do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 You've done a great job on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=135.3s	135.3	 We want the emphasis of our training to be on the word yes so that they really enjoy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=139.9s	139.9	 learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 You know the best trainers in the world are prepared to snap into training mode on a moment's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 notice for example when we see our dog getting on the counter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=150.5s	150.5	 Now it's time to make it a little bit more challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 Remember that the biggest mistake that people make with young dogs especially is a lack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=158.7s	158.7	 of supervision in that first year of life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=161.5s	161.5	 We really want to teach them to respond to us from a distance, to make sure that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 know how to leave something alone while we walk away because that's a lot harder for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=169.5s	169.5	 When they're left to make the decision on their own, very often they will opt to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 and eat the turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=174.4s	174.4	 I mean who could blame them, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=175.7s	175.7	 I think we should go over teaching her how to do leave it from a distance on the floor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 and then we'll phase it up to the counter and eventually teach her that anything on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=183.5s	183.5	 the counter is off limits without us having to even tell her leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=187.3s	187.3	 Dogs are very smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=188.3s	188.3	 She knows that I'm right here to cover it up and if I walk away she knows hey there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 a loophole maybe I can get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 We don't want to pull our dogs away for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 That doesn't teach them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 We really want them to think it through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=197.9s	197.9	 This is very tempting and she's doing a wonderful job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=200.3s	200.3	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=201.9s	201.9	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=202.9s	202.9	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 Leave it alone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsdozy4fVc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=593&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 She's still thinking about it but I'm going to let her know I like it.
