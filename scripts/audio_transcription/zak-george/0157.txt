https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Puppies bite for all kinds of reasons and biscuits is no difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=4.5s	4.5	 Ah, jeez, look at my arm at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=7.4s	7.4	 And today we're going to learn that puppies can also nip at children if we're not careful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=11.9s	11.9	 So tight!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 Now I've got you covered with what to do about all kinds of different puppy biting in this one episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 If you got a puppy, subscribe to my channel, you won't regret it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=21.6s	21.6	 I...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=22.9s	22.9	 Trust me, I'm a professional dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=25.6s	25.6	 Let me show you something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 What I like about Nom Nom, it's not your typical food that you just buy off a grocery store shelf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 This stuff is actually in my freezer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 I do not promote products that I don't think my own dogs would thrive on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=37.4s	37.4	 Choosing a food for your dog, I understand what a huge decision that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 It's made in small batches with ingredients that I would eat myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=45.7s	45.7	 And I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=46.5s	46.5	 It's probably the biggest innovation in dog food that I've seen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 By answering a few quick questions about your dog on their website,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=52.9s	52.9	 you'll get a food that was crafted in proportion to the calorie by a veterinary nutritionist just for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=59.4s	59.4	 I think everyone with a dog in the continental United States needs to try Nom Nom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=63.2s	63.2	 Nom Nom is offering 50% off just to try it for two weeks to see if it's right for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=68.5s	68.5	 When you use my special link, trinom.com slash Zach, I'm going to have that in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 In my book, Dog Training Revolution, we talk about socialization with puppies quite a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 Socialization continues to be one of our absolute top priorities with biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=82.2s	82.2	 Zach was busy, but I had a party to go to, so I thought that I would bring biscuits along.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=86.6s	86.6	 Now, when you told me you were going to this party, I had some concerns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 I needed to stay behind and do some work, but I knew there was going to be a young child there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 And since one of the main things we're talking about today is dealing with puppy biting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=99.1s	99.1	 I get the question all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=100.5s	100.5	 How do I get my puppy to stop biting my kids?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 It's one thing to get my puppy to stop biting me, but my children, that's another thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=107.7s	107.7	 So when we're dealing with children and puppies, we have to be extra cautious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=111.3s	111.3	 because kids, well, particularly young children, aren't exactly aware that they have to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 diplomatic with puppies and vice versa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 There are a lot more new things for biscuits to see at this party than I expected, honestly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 I was ready for her to interact with her first child, but there's also singing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=126.8s	126.8	 and balloons and cupcakes and gifts being unwrapped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=130.8s	130.8	 Yeah, I mean, think about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 Even something as simple as just a gift being unwrapped at close range can be very,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=137.2s	137.2	 well, interesting to a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 I mean, what do they make of that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=139.6s	139.6	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=140.3s	140.3	 In Biscuit's case, when the paper was ripping, she was like, oh, what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=143.9s	143.9	 I don't think she knew that paper could do that, but she was okay with it after a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=147.4s	147.4	 And it looked like you were really focused on keeping her anxiety low around everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 that you could there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 I mean, better safe than sorry, better to try and show her, hey, look, that wrapping paper is okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=157.3s	157.3	 rather than taking the chance that she might get scared by it and trying to resolve that later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=161.8s	161.8	 Always better to be proactive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=163.2s	163.2	 Yeah, I was trying to find the line where she could experience it without feeling too stressed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=167.9s	167.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=168.5s	168.5	 Honestly, she reminds me of a shy little kid who just wants to be held for a second when they go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=172.7s	172.7	 somewhere new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 I mean, yeah, she's relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 There's lots of noises going on too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 And everything that I'm seeing really points to a healthy reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=179.7s	179.7	 My friend's daughter, Kit, is pretty excited to pet Biscuit's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=182.9s	182.9	 She's always been very gentle when she interacts with inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=186.2s	186.2	 She's actually known her for a couple of years now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 So I think it's okay to give Kit a chance to pet Biscuit's too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 But I want to make sure Biscuit's is comfortable first, so I'm not going to just rush into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 I'm doing my best Zach impression and giving Biscuit's some treats while Kit plays nearby for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=200.2s	200.2	 She's definitely feeling pretty relaxed around Kit now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=202.7s	202.7	 I feel like Biscuit's would be okay with taking a treat from Kit this time instead of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 Hopefully that'll help Biscuit's realize even kids can be awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 I'm thinking I've been giving her treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 She's comfortable taking them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 She seems to be kind of enjoying that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 Why wouldn't she also enjoy getting a treat from Kit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 And wouldn't that be a great experience for both of them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 Probably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=221.7s	221.7	 I made sure to have one responsible adult focus on Kit so that I, another responsible adult, could focus on Biscuit's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=229.2s	229.2	 Smart idea. I think it's a good call.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=231.8s	231.8	 She did it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 Right now I'm thinking that went really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 Biscuit's looked a little wary, but Kit did an amazing job of being gentle and giving Biscuit's something she loves, a little treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=242.6s	242.6	 So for a second, honestly, I was feeling pretty proud of myself about my socialization victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=247.3s	247.3	 Like here we are, it happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 But Kit's moved so fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=251.5s	251.5	 They do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=252.7s	252.7	 Kit and I are really close, so she climbed up on my lap to give me a hug too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=256.4s	256.4	 And as fast as lightning, her face went down over Biscuit's while she was climbing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=261.8s	261.8	 This is exactly what we were hoping to prevent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=265.1s	265.1	 I thought I did everything to prepare and somehow this still happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=269.7s	269.7	 The last thing I wanted was for Biscuit's to be in a position to snap at a kid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 Of course, as soon as it happened, it's immediately clear what the problem was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=278.1s	278.1	 I got careless and I put Biscuit's in a position to have her personal space encroached upon by someone she isn't comfortable enough with yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=285.5s	285.5	 Well, fortunately, you did pretty good damage control and immediately prevented it from escalating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=289.9s	289.9	 That's the next best thing that can happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=291.6s	291.6	 I don't want to make too much light of this issue because this is exactly how children get bit all the time by us being careless and not managing the situation well enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=300.8s	300.8	 But left unchecked, things like this can get out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=303.6s	303.6	 Children can get hurt, a dog can get labeled and have an official bite history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=307.8s	307.8	 And those things can be problematic, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=310.4s	310.4	 Regardless of the size of any dog, we really have to manage them and effectively keep these things from happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=315.3s	315.3	 That certainly wasn't an ideal experience as we've established for Biscuit's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=319.2s	319.2	 But I think a lot of people are tempted to scold the dog in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=323.5s	323.5	 And that's the last thing we want to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=325.1s	325.1	 We don't want to repress that expression from Biscuit's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=328.6s	328.6	 Rather, we want to address the underlying emotional cause, which in this case is most likely her just being nervous that someone's getting really close to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=336.0s	336.0	 The reason we don't want to scold it is, yeah, maybe you'll shut down the behavior in the short term.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=340.5s	340.5	 But long term, you don't have the notice that you might want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=344.0s	344.0	 And that's where things kind of happen out of the blue all of a sudden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=347.4s	347.4	 So that's why it's important to take the high road here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=350.8s	350.8	 What I'm about to say has enormous gravity and it's something that is not grasped by most people if they're not experienced with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=359.9s	359.9	 So if you could remember this one thing, you're going to set yourself up for profound success moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=366.5s	366.5	 If you become a master at managing your dog, you can prevent virtually any unwanted behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 Full stop. We demonstrate this all the time on the channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=377.8s	377.8	 For example, your dog cannot run out of the door if they don't have access to an open door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=382.4s	382.4	 It's impossible. That's management.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=384.1s	384.1	 Now, of course, we still need to train them how to behave in that situation and in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=388.7s	388.7	 But management is a precursor to the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=392.0s	392.0	 So make sure that management is as flawless as possible in whatever issue you're dealing with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 So in this case, literally preventing her from being in a position to snap at Kit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=402.5s	402.5	 That way, it literally cannot happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=405.1s	405.1	 That doesn't mean this is a substitute for training, but this is half of the equation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=409.4s	409.4	 That's the idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=410.7s	410.7	 But I also want her to have a better experience with Kit if I can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=413.9s	413.9	 I don't want to just leave it at like this kid came and scared me and then it was over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=418.5s	418.5	 Fine line, but yeah, I mean, that's going to like depend on each situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=422.2s	422.2	 So what did you decide to do in this case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=423.8s	423.8	 Because there would be no problem in saying, you know what, they don't interact at all anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=428.2s	428.2	 for the rest of the evening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=429.4s	429.4	 If Biscuits had seemed like that's what she needed, I absolutely would have done that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=433.1s	433.1	 And so the way that I tested was by staying in the same room as Kit again, but, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=438.2s	438.2	 farther away, preventing them from getting too close and hanging out with Biscuits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=442.4s	442.4	 doing some more conditioning or I guess counter conditioning now because I messed up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=446.2s	446.2	 By counter conditioning, you mean you're just like trying to repair that association
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=450.2s	450.2	 she may have now with Kit's getting in her personal space, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=453.8s	453.8	 Yes, I'm hoping to change her emotional response when she sees Kit from that kid might come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=459.4s	459.4	 and crush me to, okay, at least I get treats when that kid's around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=463.0s	463.0	 She might not be so bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=464.2s	464.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=465.0s	465.0	 After a few minutes, it seems like Biscuits is feeling a little more relaxed again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=469.4s	469.4	 but I'm still trying to figure out what the best route would be to help Biscuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=472.5s	472.5	 make some actual progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=474.6s	474.6	 Just as I was wondering that, our friend Alex showed up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=477.1s	477.1	 He's one of the biggest dog lovers we know and that is saying something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=480.4s	480.4	 I think he loves dogs more than I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=482.4s	482.4	 I do too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=483.1s	483.1	 So I felt like he was definitely a good tool in my toolbox at this party to help me with Biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=487.6s	487.6	 I knew he'd be really patient and help me out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=489.4s	489.4	 So I asked Alex to give Biscuits some treats just like Kit had done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=493.5s	493.5	 I was hoping that would help her start to have a more positive experience with a similar situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=497.8s	497.8	 of a person coming in that's not you and me and giving her treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=501.0s	501.0	 It sounds like you're just covering your bases here just to make sure that Biscuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=504.2s	504.2	 hasn't somehow now regressed and thought of human beings in general as being more threatening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=509.1s	509.1	 than she might have before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=510.3s	510.3	 I also just felt like it was my easiest route to like easing her back in because I know that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=515.7s	515.7	 Kit is intimidating to Biscuits now, but I also know that she likes getting treats from people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=520.6s	520.6	 So half of that equation where she had the breakdown, I can do again and then hopefully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=525.4s	525.4	 we can add Kit in later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=526.8s	526.8	 Over the rest of the evening, I want to really take my time letting Biscuits get to know Kit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=531.1s	531.1	 at her own pace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=533.2s	533.2	 When Biscuits is in the mood again, I'll try some counter conditioning again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=536.6s	536.6	 And it's not like you're just giving her treats constantly throughout the evening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=539.7s	539.7	 Between the times when you're giving her treats, you're also letting her observe Kit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=543.5s	543.5	 at a distance as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=545.0s	545.0	 Connolly observing things that might excite dogs is a big part of socializing them as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=549.7s	549.7	 So I gave her as much time as she wanted and eventually she actually did want to join the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=554.0s	554.0	 party. She got a lot more confident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=555.7s	555.7	 She's running around, she's exploring, and then she was like, oh, that's my buddy Alex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=559.7s	559.7	 And she went and hung out with him maybe even longer than she was hanging out with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=567.4s	567.4	 That sounds like the Biscuits I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=569.2s	569.2	 And if Biscuits can feel normal around an amazing trampoline artist like Kit, chances are this will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=574.6s	574.6	 go a long way towards socializing her around less talented children as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=579.0s	579.0	 I'm noticing that Biscuits is even feeling comfortable closer and closer to Kit as the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=583.8s	583.8	 night goes on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=584.7s	584.7	 And Kit seems pretty unbothered by Biscuits as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=587.8s	587.8	 Eventually Kit's interested in interacting with Biscuits again too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=590.9s	590.9	 So be really gentle, okay, because she's a little bit nervous of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=594.3s	594.3	 Kit is doing really well and she's being so gentle here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=597.4s	597.4	 But I have learned my lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=599.0s	599.0	 This time we're going to triple team this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=601.2s	601.2	 I want to make sure we all have enough hands to keep both Kit and Biscuits safe and happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=606.6s	606.6	 So how many grown adults does it take to introduce a puppy to a child?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=611.3s	611.3	 I like what you did there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=612.2s	612.2	 Experienced trainers know that if you can give the puppy 100% of your attention and you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=617.0s	617.0	 someone to give the child 100% of your attention, that's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=620.6s	620.6	 We've been training Biscuits about a couple of weeks now and her puppy biting has shown
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=624.4s	624.4	 really steady improvements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=626.8s	626.8	 I mean, most of the time anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=628.6s	628.6	 The thing is I like her, but I also like this vest and I want to, I know I want to cuddle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=632.4s	632.4	 with you, but she just manages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=634.0s	634.0	 Ouch!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=635.2s	635.2	 Geez!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=636.1s	636.1	 Right, I know, I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=637.3s	637.3	 Come on!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=637.9s	637.9	 So I mean, obviously we have to put a stop to that, don't we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=641.8s	641.8	 Ouch, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=642.6s	642.6	 There are lots of different types of puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=645.0s	645.0	 I mean, there's the kind of biting where they bite on your clothes and your skin,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=678.5s	678.5	 Don't bite me either.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=693.5s	693.5	 That's why we have things for her to gnaw on when she wants something hard to chew on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=712.1s	712.1	 Now, we've also had to work with biscuits on moderating her biting behavior around my

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=725.3s	725.3	 Love how she's getting down on biscuits level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=729.4s	729.4	 That's what I've been looking for.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=749.2s	749.2	 on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=755.1s	755.1	 Now, a while back, we gave advice on how to deal with puppy biting in biscuits case.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S2y77dIuCE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=158&pp=iAQB&t=769.5s	769.5	 training her new things, reviewing things that she's learned, and really stimulating
