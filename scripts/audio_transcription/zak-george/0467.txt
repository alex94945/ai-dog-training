https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=125.8s	125.8	 if you've got a dog like Zeus, because look at him.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 And that's not because he's a bad dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=132.3s	132.3	 If you'll sit, I'll give you a treat. Let's try this. OK.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=142.6s	142.6	 I appreciate that. So does my hand.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=154.9s	154.9	 I hope next all of this excess energy can make it really challenging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 for a dog like Zeus to listen to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=160.5s	160.5	 I mean, think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 He was bred to herd sheep for hours on end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 Now he's just got a normal life in the suburbs, which is totally fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=167.9s	167.9	 But we have to find other ways to make sure that our dog is satisfied
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=171.1s	171.1	 mentally and physically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 We human beings, we made them like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=174.2s	174.2	 So we have a responsibility to keep them satisfied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=176.4s	176.4	 Fortunately, fetch early in the day and just before training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=179.7s	179.7	 will likely do the trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 If you've got a high energy dog, I'll have a video in the description

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=185.7s	185.7	 The reason dogs jump like this in the first place is because they like to greet us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 at the face. They want to say hello and really interact with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=192.4s	192.4	 Now, if you're struggling with teaching your dog how not to jump,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=195.1s	195.1	 your issue isn't that your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=196.6s	196.6	 No, don't bite my ankles, dude.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 Your issue isn't that you have a jumping dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=201.4s	201.4	 The issue is that you haven't taught your dog how to sit and stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=204.8s	204.8	 when they're excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=205.9s	205.9	 We're going to see how Zeus's sit stay is looking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 Sit. Oh, that was kind of a disaster, Zeus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 Now you can clearly see how teaching a dog like Zeus to sit and stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 is different than many of the other dogs I work with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 I mean, he's bigger and stronger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 He's more intense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 His mind is going a million miles an hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 That was a good sit. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=224.4s	224.4	 OK, good job. His focus is really strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=226.8s	226.8	 With dogs like this, you have to constantly engage them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=229.5s	229.5	 during a training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 And if you're new, that's not very natural.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=233.2s	233.2	 So you'll have to be extra patient until you acquire the skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=236.5s	236.5	 Here's a good example. Teaching your dog to leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=238.6s	238.6	 The second I put the treat in front of him, he's trying to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=240.7s	240.7	 So you've got to be really quick about being one step ahead of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 Back here. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=251.4s	251.4	 Go and see. I mean, I'm pulling away at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 You can see it in his eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=256.1s	256.1	 Dogs will foreshadow very obviously if you know what you're looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=259.6s	259.6	 And as you get to know your dog, yes, then you'll be able to predict that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=262.6s	262.6	 That was a good leave it right there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=266.4s	266.4	 than he was on the prior attempts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=267.8s	267.8	 Just doing exercises like this, build communication between you two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 That's why I do leave it with almost every dog that I work with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=274.1s	274.1	 And that's good because he needs some impulse control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=277.1s	277.1	 A lot of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=278.2s	278.2	 I often use turkey or chicken when I'm training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=280.3s	280.3	 These are really extra convenient, though, because they're dry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=282.7s	282.7	 They're not wet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=283.6s	283.6	 These are really good to store around the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=285.3s	285.3	 if you have a new dog and you need to get treats really fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=288.1s	288.1	 Having your dog stay like this when you're completely focused on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=291.1s	291.1	 That's one thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=292.3s	292.3	 Of course, getting them to pull the sit, stay when things get more exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=295.9s	295.9	 Well, that's a tougher thing to accomplish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=297.8s	297.8	 So if I'm acting ridiculous, Zeus obviously gets excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 and starts playing and biting and all of that other stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=304.1s	304.1	 So we're going to work up to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=308.5s	308.5	 So I provided a distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=309.9s	309.9	 You might have noticed there it was subtle, but I got his eyes on me, too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=312.6s	312.6	 by making a little sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=315.3s	315.3	 Yes. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 Just practicing is going to make things a lot easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=320.7s	320.7	 when the real life situations present themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=323.2s	323.2	 You don't wait until you have company over or you're in public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=325.3s	325.3	 to then attempt to work on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=327.1s	327.1	 Sit. Good. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=331.2s	331.2	 Yes. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 Yeah. Now, that's a home run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=337.7s	337.7	 Now, if I tell Zeus to stay and I throw this toy, he's likely going to go and chase it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=341.9s	341.9	 So let's see if we can improve that just a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=345.4s	345.4	 Up here. Yes. Good. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=350.9s	350.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=353.8s	353.8	 Good correction, sir. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=355.9s	355.9	 That's what I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=356.8s	356.8	 Dogs like this, even though he's really hyper, did you see how he stopped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=359.7s	359.7	 mid stride when I said as he went to go for it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=362.4s	362.4	 So he really self corrected there. And that's very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=365.2s	365.2	 It's natural for a dog to be confused when you're telling them to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=367.9s	367.9	 and there's something exciting going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=369.4s	369.4	 It's not reasonable to expect a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=371.0s	371.0	 It's only been on this planet less than two years to just understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=374.9s	374.9	 they're supposed to be good. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=378.2s	378.2	 Yeah. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=381.4s	381.4	 Up here. Look at me, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=383.3s	383.3	 Yeah. Oh, you're on the right track now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=385.3s	385.3	 You want your dog to exercise self control in so many different circumstances,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=389.5s	389.5	 especially exciting ones. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=397.2s	397.2	 Yes. I'm going to get on the ground and start acting ridiculous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=400.4s	400.4	 Now, because that's going to be even tougher for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=403.2s	403.2	 Stay. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=406.6s	406.6	 Looks like he thought about breaking there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=408.4s	408.4	 So I want to make sure I reward him before he breaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=411.4s	411.4	 And again, even though this is teaching stay, this is central
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=414.5s	414.5	 to teaching a dog not to jump in the beginning stages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=417.1s	417.1	 I'm able to pet Zeus right now, give him a little bit of love.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=420.2s	420.2	 And he's not jumping on me. Hey, have a well bar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=422.4s	422.4	 It's really impressive. Let me see if I can do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=426.2s	426.2	 If you know that you've got guests coming over, exercise your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=430.0s	430.0	 Just before guests arrive, make sure they're on a leash or in another room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=433.5s	433.5	 so that you can minimize or prevent the jumping from occurring in the first place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 And once your guests are settled, bring out your dog and practice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=439.6s	439.6	 sit and stay in front of them, have them pet your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=442.2s	442.2	 And if your dog attempts to jump, simply intervene and redirect them into a sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=445.6s	445.6	 or lie down like we did earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=446.9s	446.9	 Yes, that's how you do a redirect right up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=451.5s	451.5	 It's your responsibility to do this training, not your guests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=454.9s	454.9	 A lot of people are tempted to have their guests do the training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=457.2s	457.2	 but your dog needs to learn to listen to you when they're excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_qUHppxOn8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=468&pp=iAQB&t=459.5s	459.5	 Click thumbs up for Zeus. Get the treats I used in today's video from Petflow.
