https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 In this episode, I'm going to put inertia's leash walking to the test and hopefully make some progress towards getting her to listen to me in brand new and exciting places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 I'm Zach George. I train dogs. This is my new dog and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=15.3s	15.3	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly. You can start from the beginning or you can pick up anywhere.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect, your results will forever remain in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=29.9s	29.9	 This is inertia. Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=36.2s	36.2	 Getting your dog's food delivered is ultra convenient, especially when you don't have to think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=40.8s	40.8	 By going to PetFlow and choosing your dog's favorite brand of food and telling them how often you want it to be delivered, you'll never have to leave the house to get your pet's food again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=49.7s	49.7	 Plus, every order from PetFlow helps to feed a shelter pet in need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=53.1s	53.1	 Get $10 off your first three automatic shipments when you enter code ZACH30. I'll have a link in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 So today I'm hoping to take you along as we do some heel training in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 She's really good at home or in the driveway. But when you come to a place like this, things can be a little more challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=70.2s	70.2	 I got my green juice and we're just going to hang out here and let her adjust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=73.6s	73.6	 And once I feel like she's adjusted and she's not like, whoa, what's all this stuff around here? Who are these people?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 What's that dog? Then we're going to focus on training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 All right, I'm done. It's time to train you now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=87.3s	87.3	 So the next thing I'm doing is getting her familiar with the path, just letting her smell it and acclimate herself to where she is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 Heel is where your dog stays by your side, whether you're standing still or moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 You'll remember that one of the prerequisites to teaching your dog heels that you can reliably get their attention on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=103.5s	103.5	 Look at me. Yes. Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=106.2s	106.2	 Yes. Good. She's relatively adjusted now. We've practiced. Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=110.9s	110.9	 Now I want to practice putting her in the heel position and make sure that she'll do that willingly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 She's feeling a little anxious today, and I suspect that's because she's ready to get into training a little bit more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=122.5s	122.5	 Am I being too boring? OK, I'll be more exciting. Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 There we go. Look at that. Here you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=128.7s	128.7	 You know, earlier in the series, we covered how to teach your dog the spin into that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=132.8s	132.8	 And so that's something we've been practicing a lot. Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=136.4s	136.4	 Heel. Good. And then switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 I know she gets a little confused on switch sometimes, but that's OK. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=143.6s	143.6	 So now that she's reliably doing that, I'm just going to focus on walking, making sure that you'll pay attention to me for many seconds at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=150.3s	150.3	 Slow down. Inertia. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 Come here. This way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 Good. So when you first start training heel, you'll hold up a lure like that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 Gives him a target to look at. She's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 She knows you got to treat. She's like, all right, if I pay attention, I'll probably get that reward. Switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=174.9s	174.9	 Good. Here, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=179.1s	179.1	 Slowly. Faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=182.1s	182.1	 Yeah, she's really good about stopping when I stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=184.8s	184.8	 We've established that she likes looking at the treat, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=187.3s	187.3	 So the next thing that I really want to be focused on with her is teaching her how to look at my hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=191.4s	191.4	 And this is something we're facing in every once in a while when her interest fades, I'll go back and let her know I've got that treat and use it as a lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=197.7s	197.7	 So I'm not afraid to do that. But I also want to have her be less dependent on holding a treat up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 In other words, I want her to be able to respond to a hand signal or a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 Switch. Good. Look at me. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=209.3s	209.3	 And switch. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=212.3s	212.3	 That's called heel. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=215.3s	215.3	 With heel training, especially in environments like this, you don't want to make the mistake of phasing out treats too early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=220.3s	220.3	 And in real formal sessions like this, I'll even reward pretty generously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=224.3s	224.3	 When I'm doing more casual training, I might not reward court training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=227.3s	227.3	 But I do want to make sure that she's not too much of a pain in the ass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=230.3s	230.3	 So I'm going to do a heel training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=233.3s	233.3	 I'll train at 30 seconds here and 30 seconds there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=239.3s	239.3	 Let them go on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=242.3s	242.3	 Stand. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=245.3s	245.3	 That was exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 Easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=251.3s	251.3	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=257.3s	257.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=261.3s	261.3	 Good. We're also mindful to keep practicing different turns by taking heel to the next level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=266.3s	266.3	 I want her to be able to do a right turn, a left turn, be able to speed up or slow down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=270.3s	270.3	 It's really important for her to pay attention to me and stay at my side under a variety of different circumstances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=276.3s	276.3	 Sometimes I'll have her turn and stay on one side. Other times I'll turn and keep her on the same side so she doesn't have to switch at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=282.3s	282.3	 So it just depends. I want her to understand all of those nuances in heel training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=287.3s	287.3	 OK, you earned it. You earned it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=290.3s	290.3	 It's important to to be really cognizant of your dog's body language and their state of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=294.3s	294.3	 But if you notice your dog is frustrated or they're not particularly enjoying the training session, that's your cue to take a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=299.3s	299.3	 Biting the leash like this seems like inertia's way of expressing a little impatience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=303.3s	303.3	 She seems to be saying, let's play. Give me a treat. What more do you want?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=307.3s	307.3	 You'll be amazed what a two or three minute break might do to your training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=311.3s	311.3	 So I'm sure to take breaks very often with inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=314.3s	314.3	 We make it a point to practice this a few times a week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 And I noticed that at least in inertia's case, sometimes she's really on and sometimes she's like, I'm not so much in the mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=324.3s	324.3	 So I have to be really aware of those things and do my best to really motivate her to want to do the training session with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=329.3s	329.3	 It's normal, too, for many dogs to pay attention to you and then get a little distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=334.3s	334.3	 But look for those moments where they voluntarily give you their attention, especially without you asking for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=339.3s	339.3	 Heel is the most disciplined form of leash walking and it requires a lot of brain power from our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=343.3s	343.3	 And if you're always insisting on a proper heel, it doesn't really give your dog an outlet to see, smell and experience their environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=349.3s	349.3	 And that really is a huge part of having a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=351.3s	351.3	 So it's good for mental exercise and it's great for certain situations, especially in cities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=356.3s	356.3	 But it's not a substitute for more relaxed leash walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=359.3s	359.3	 I'm periodically testing inertia by continuing to give her more challenging training scenarios.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=364.3s	364.3	 With inertia being now around one year old, it's time to start teaching her how to be more reliable in a variety of different environments and in different contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=372.3s	372.3	 I'm visiting my brothers and my sister-in-law and my niece actually here in Atlanta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=376.3s	376.3	 So the way that I like to really introduce off leash training is to seek out unfamiliar but still safe and secure areas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=383.3s	383.3	 In this case, the yard is completely fenced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=385.3s	385.3	 See, it's really important in the beginning stages that the environment is completely secure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=390.3s	390.3	 But the trick is your dog shouldn't realize that over the next 12 months or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=395.3s	395.3	 I really want to do extensive testing before trusting her off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=400.3s	400.3	 So I've got on a 50 foot lead right now just to make sure she's reliable before I take her off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 Double controlled environments are the best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=406.3s	406.3	 My dog has disappeared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=408.3s	408.3	 Inertia, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=410.3s	410.3	 There we go. There's a good recall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=412.3s	412.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=414.3s	414.3	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=415.3s	415.3	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=416.3s	416.3	 You might know that I like to give my dog some time to adapt and adjust in a new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=423.3s	423.3	 So that's what I'm doing right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=424.3s	424.3	 I'm just letting her explore, being as tolerant as I can so that she is able to satisfy some of that curiosity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=430.3s	430.3	 I first want to make sure that she'll come to me, especially when her attention is divided like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=434.3s	434.3	 I mean, you can see she really wants to get up into the house, explore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=437.3s	437.3	 Inertia, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=440.3s	440.3	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=442.3s	442.3	 Sit. Lie down. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=444.3s	444.3	 So she's demonstrating that she's pretty obedient, at least under these circumstances in this environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=449.3s	449.3	 So I feel pretty good about taking the lead off as long as she'll come to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=452.3s	452.3	 But I'm going to encourage her to just stay a few feet from me just to kind of make sure she generally follows me while I walk around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=459.3s	459.3	 So let's see. Hey, Inertia, stay over here. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=462.3s	462.3	 Come on. There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=464.3s	464.3	 And go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=467.3s	467.3	 So I just wanted to see if she would play with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=469.3s	469.3	 She got a little bored with the game. That's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=471.3s	471.3	 Well, my brother's pug at least wants to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=474.3s	474.3	 No? What do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=475.3s	475.3	 All right. Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=477.3s	477.3	 Oh, wow. She's kind of quick, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=479.3s	479.3	 And what a good opportunity to practice stay with a significant distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=484.3s	484.3	 So that's something we've been working on teaching her how to stay in the face of distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=488.3s	488.3	 I really want to make sure that her stay is reliable in these new places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=491.3s	491.3	 Inertia, lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=493.3s	493.3	 Stay. A down stay tends to be a bit more reliable than any other kind of stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=498.3s	498.3	 So we'll keep it easy for her. I'm going to walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=506.3s	506.3	 Come over here. Don't want to push her to failure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=509.3s	509.3	 OK, come. Good. Let's see how Inertia's frisbee training is doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=513.3s	513.3	 Keep going. Keep going. Good. Lie down and come around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=518.3s	518.3	 OK, this way. Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=520.3s	520.3	 I'm also really impressed with how well Inertia is doing playing fetch this close to Snooze too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=525.3s	525.3	 Other dogs can be so distracting to her and she just loves to play, but she's still staying focused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=531.3s	531.3	 Training your dog to listen to you off leash in new places is taught 15, 20 minutes at a time like this over the course of many months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=538.3s	538.3	 You want to really go out of your way to proof this over an extended period of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=543.3s	543.3	 because it's extremely important that your dog has a lot of experience listening to you when in new distracting environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=549.3s	549.3	 So today I'm really happy. I mean, Inertia was reliable with listening to me around another dog in a new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0UXmPuMMA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=554.3s	554.3	 So I'm excited. Good job, Inertia. I'm proud of you.
