https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=16.6s	16.6	 Click thumbs up for Clementine, the great Pyrenees, Akbosh and ouch, Piranha mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 Clementine's 12 weeks old and when she grows up she's going to be ginormous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=25.4s	25.4	 Subscribe to my channel, I post all the time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=31.2s	31.2	 If your dog keeps you up, it can really affect you the next day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 It's not like you can skip buying your dog's food, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=36.7s	36.7	 So save yourself the effort of having to go to the pet store to get your dog's food and supplies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=40.8s	40.8	 And instead have them automatically shipped to you right to your front door from PetFlow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 Choose your favorite brand of dog food.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 I'll have the link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 If your dog wakes up at night, it can be really overwhelming to deal with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=59.6s	59.6	 But what do you do when your dog cries?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 Since Clementine is in such a bitey mood, I'm going to go ahead and give her a chew toy to snack on while I give you guys some advice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 Should you take your dog out every time they cry?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=69.7s	69.7	 Ignore them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=70.7s	70.7	 Let them cry it out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=71.8s	71.8	 Scold them or what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 First, let's examine why puppies cry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=75.2s	75.2	 See, dogs don't intuitively understand our schedules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 And if you've gotten a new dog, there's a really good chance that they're really thrown off by their new circumstances and surroundings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 This can cause anxiety, which can cause many dogs to feel uneasy, and cry or whine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 This adjustment period is the single biggest reason that dogs cry at night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=92.7s	92.7	 When babies cry, we ask ourselves, have all their needs been met?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=95.9s	95.9	 And then we act accordingly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=97.5s	97.5	 This is basically what we should do with our dogs, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=99.7s	99.7	 Remember that if you've got a young puppy, you're actually not even entitled to be able to sleep all the way through the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=104.7s	104.7	 I mean, you should still be taking them outside to do their business a couple of times in the middle of the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 Once your dog is about three to four months old, they ought to be physically able to make it through the entire night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 Over time, you'll learn the difference between all of your dog's different whines and cries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 One of them might mean, hey, I've got to be taken outside right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 While another one could mean, I'm hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=123.7s	123.7	 It's dinner time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 And then there's the classic, I'm so bored and I'm going to wine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=129.3s	129.3	 The boredom wine is actually pretty common, but it's pretty easy to overcome in most cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 For immediate relief, give them lots of age appropriate physical and mental exercise throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 And make sure to give them some exercise just before putting them to bed, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 Discourage excessive napping throughout the day as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 For puppies like Clementine, a good long walk should do the trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=149.6s	149.6	 But for older, higher energy dogs, you should be working on teaching them a polished game of fetch every opportunity you get,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=156.1s	156.1	 which can take many weeks of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 Working on obedience and other training is a great way to mentally challenge your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 And this can help them sleep through the night, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 You know the feeling when you've been studying or learning things all day and you just feel totally zapped?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 That's what we're going for here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=170.7s	170.7	 And when you do put them to bed, consider giving them a safe chew toy so that they have something to do and are less likely to be bored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=176.7s	176.7	 If you've ruled out the probability of a medical issue by asking your vet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 made sure your dog has lots of healthy physical and mental exercise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=184.6s	184.6	 taking care of all of their needs like food, water and going outside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=188.6s	188.6	 and they're still crying, it's probably time to try just ignoring the crying for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=193.2s	193.2	 When your dog is whining or barking, a minute can feel like 10 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 So I find that it's helpful to do something like start a stopwatch or a timer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=201.1s	201.1	 That way you can keep track of how long it takes your dog to actually quiet down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=205.1s	205.1	 Keeping track can help you notice progress where you otherwise might not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 Once your dog gets quiet after five, 10, 15 minutes, or however long it takes, take note of that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=213.5s	213.5	 Your goal is to see the length of time that your dog barks or whines get shorter and shorter over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=217.9s	217.9	 It's not like this behavior goes away all at one time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 So this can help you notice progress where you otherwise might not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 Of course, if your dog seems extremely stressed out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=225.8s	225.8	 this could mean that they don't like their crate or they don't like being away from you in another room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=230.3s	230.3	 So consider something like a puppy playpen or an indoor tie out near your bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=234.3s	234.3	 so that your dog can feel more comfortable and closer to you as they go through this adjustment period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=239.1s	239.1	 This may not be a very quick process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=241.1s	241.1	 So you need to be prepared to be very patient and tolerant as you work through this period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=246.1s	246.1	 But don't worry, it's all going to be worth it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 I'm going to have a playlist in the description that will show you how to teach your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=251.3s	251.3	 all of the basics and beyond in order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=254.1s	254.1	 Chances are if you're watching this video, you'll probably need it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ZD6bZ-xTc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=446&pp=iAQB&t=256.8s	256.8	 Click thumbs up for Clementine, subscribe to this channel,
