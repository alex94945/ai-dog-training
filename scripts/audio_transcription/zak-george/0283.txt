https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=73.7s	73.7	 is a really valuable thing to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 because it builds communication with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 and it really allows you to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=78.4s	78.4	 this intricate communication with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 that really spills over into everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 This trick is really near and dear to my heart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 The last dog I taught this to was my dog, Venus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=87.1s	87.1	 and Inertia is showing promise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 and I'm hoping that we're going to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=90.7s	90.7	 a good example of it today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 The trick is limp when I ask her to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 and that means basically walking on three legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 A few days ago I was working on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 and it's one of those tricks that really requires you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=100.9s	100.9	 to just kind of tune into the individual dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=103.5s	103.5	 There's no quick and easy way to teach it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=105.1s	105.1	 that I found anyway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=108.1s	108.1	 while standing in one position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=109.7s	109.7	 The trick is basically to get her to continue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=112.2s	112.2	 to hold that paw up while she advances forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=115.1s	115.1	 The way that I would start teaching this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 is basically to place my hand right underneath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 one of her paws, not hold her paw,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=121.4s	121.4	 but just have it there as some support
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 so that she could get the muscle memory intact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=125.7s	125.7	 to walk on three legs while holding her front paw up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=128.4s	128.4	 Wait.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=137.6s	137.6	 and luring her with my other hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=139.6s	139.6	 to encourage her to move forward,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=141.3s	141.3	 I'm looking for any bit of the most minute effort from her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 to advance without putting that foot on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=149.8s	149.8	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 from dog to dog, and I think there's probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 a lot of ways to teach this,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=470.7s	470.7	 by leash or by crate, anywhere near as much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=472.9s	472.9	 Downstairs in the house, she has basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=475.8s	475.8	 free reign to go where she wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=477.1s	477.1	 as long as we're supervising her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=479.1s	479.1	 But I think because of a lot of the prevention work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=481.6s	481.6	 that we've done, in other words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=482.7s	482.7	 teaching her not to jump on the counter,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=486.0s	486.0	 by doing those real life leave it training sessions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=488.5s	488.5	 I think we've really set her up for success,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=490.6s	490.6	 which is why we're seeing pretty good results on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=492.9s	492.9	 Inertia has done virtually no damage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=495.6s	495.6	 to any of our personal property

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=502.5s	502.5	 prevention, training, supervision, and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=505.4s	505.4	 I'm still not completely comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=507.7s	507.7	 just leaving her in the house when we go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=510.4s	510.4	 So I've been keeping her in this large crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=512.6s	512.6	 as I mentioned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=513.4s	513.4	 You might recall we did have this exercise pen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=515.6s	515.6	 Since she's not spending as much time contained these days,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=519.3s	519.3	 I've gone just to the oversized crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=521.3s	521.3	 since the only time she really goes in here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=523.4s	523.4	 is when she's taking a nap or like I say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=525.5s	525.5	 when we leave the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=526.4s	526.4	 You might recall that Inertia was struggling

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=531.2s	531.2	 anxiety several months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=533.3s	533.3	 That's something that we've been working on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=534.9s	534.9	 I'm gonna redo a drill that we did a few months ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=537.9s	537.9	 Basically, I wanna put her in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=539.4s	539.4	 I'm gonna close it right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=541.0s	541.0	 Hopefully she settles down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=542.9s	542.9	 And I'm going to attempt to go out of the side door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=545.8s	545.8	 over here and I'm gonna have this camera rolling

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=550.1s	550.1	 Remember her prior habit was the second she would hear us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=553.5s	553.5	 go out of that side door, she would start panicking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=555.6s	555.6	 and barking and that's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=557.0s	557.0	 that we've been working on a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=558.2s	558.2	 Since I've been working with her earlier today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=560.2s	560.2	 I think this is gonna go pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=561.9s	561.9	 I've been giving her her training and her exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=563.8s	563.8	 so I'm not putting a dog with lots of energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=566.1s	566.1	 and a dog that hasn't had a lot of time with her person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=568.5s	568.5	 up in a crate and then just hoping she's gonna behave well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=570.8s	570.8	 That's an important distinction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=572.3s	572.3	 You need to really make sure a dog is fulfilled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=574.6s	574.6	 and getting their daily exercise and attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=576.8s	576.8	 before you can expect them to just be calm and good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=579.3s	579.3	 when you put them up in a crate and then leave.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=584.7s	584.7	 That shot's going live.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=589.7s	589.7	 And then I'm gonna have this camera follow me out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=592.1s	592.1	 and we'll see how she does.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=595.3s	595.3	 I'm just gonna walk out over here and we'll see how it goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=599.8s	599.8	 And what we're listening for is silence, hopefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=603.8s	603.8	 So she looks pretty relaxed right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=606.0s	606.0	 Now again, the trigger in the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=608.1s	608.1	 has been when we would open this door, sorry that it's dark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=611.7s	611.7	 So I know she can hear that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=612.9s	612.9	 We're gonna step outside here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=615.4s	615.4	 Gonna close the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=618.5s	618.5	 And so it sounds like she's being pretty quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=621.8s	621.8	 And so she's being a good dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=622.8s	622.8	 I mean, that's what we're looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=623.7s	623.7	 We're looking for this normalcy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=624.9s	624.9	 I realize this is pretty uneventful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=627.3s	627.3	 That's a neighbor dog you're hearing barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=629.1s	629.1	 So let's go check on her and see how she's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=633.8s	633.8	 Also, when I come back in, I don't make a big ordeal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=636.3s	636.3	 I don't run over to the crate and let her out immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=639.8s	639.8	 You know, I want her to be comfortable in there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=642.3s	642.3	 but you know, so far so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=643.4s	643.4	 You can see she's, her body language seems to indicate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=646.2s	646.2	 that she's pretty comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=647.2s	647.2	 She doesn't seem to be stressed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=649.2s	649.2	 There might be a little bit of concern there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=650.7s	650.7	 but we're not seeing that frantic barking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=653.6s	653.6	 and everything that we once saw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=655.1s	655.1	 She's really adapting quite well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=656.7s	656.7	 This is something we've been being pretty consistent with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=658.7s	658.7	 That's an update on her separation anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=660.9s	660.9	 We're on our way to a parade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=662.8s	662.8	 It's gonna be Inersha's very first parade ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=665.0s	665.0	 Those are very common in New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=667.0s	667.0	 They come with tons of distractions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=669.0s	669.0	 smells, sights, all sorts of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=671.4s	671.4	 It's hard to say how well she'll do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=673.2s	673.2	 but she's been doing better and better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=674.6s	674.6	 in more intense environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=676.2s	676.2	 She does relatively well in a neighborhood setting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=678.8s	678.8	 but when we go to this parade,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=680.0s	680.0	 I expect her to be heavily distracted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=681.9s	681.9	 but there's only one way for her to gain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=683.5s	683.5	 that life experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=684.6s	684.6	 One of the things I'm trying to accomplish today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=686.2s	686.2	 is really having Inersha stay when we're walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=688.9s	688.9	 Like if there's suddenly a group of strangers coming up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=691.3s	691.3	 and I just want to be able to keep her in position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=693.0s	693.0	 so they can pass, I want to easily be able to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=695.2s	695.2	 She's getting much better about holding her position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=697.1s	697.1	 when people pass at close range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=698.9s	698.9	 I'm making an effort to practice this several times a week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=701.9s	701.9	 I know, it's exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=704.0s	704.0	 You're gonna see so many crazy things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=705.4s	705.4	 Welcome to New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=707.0s	707.0	 It's Mardi Gras.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=708.1s	708.1	 The parade is coming through over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=709.6s	709.6	 and I'm gonna make sure that I can get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=711.2s	711.2	 Inersha's attention on me in front of the parade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=714.2s	714.2	 before I get any closer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=715.4s	715.4	 because there's tons of people, lots of sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=717.6s	717.6	 Look at me, yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=720.3s	720.3	 Good, okay, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=721.7s	721.7	 Now that I've done some focus exercises,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=723.8s	723.8	 I'm just going to stand at a distance here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=725.8s	725.8	 and really ask nothing of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=727.2s	727.2	 I'm just a horse in the parade over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=729.6s	729.6	 I've been doing a lot of desensitizing around mules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=732.1s	732.1	 in the French Quarter here in New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=734.2s	734.2	 So, so far she seems to be doing okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=736.2s	736.2	 Get her a little closer and make sure she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=738.4s	738.4	 Let's prove this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=739.5s	739.5	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=740.7s	740.7	 Normal reaction, which is no reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=743.8s	743.8	 We've got the percussion going on behind us over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=747.4s	747.4	 Inersha's very curious, but she's doing quite well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=751.5s	751.5	 And right now, not training, just giving her exposure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=754.2s	754.2	 letting her smell in here and see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=757.3s	757.3	 Yeah, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=758.6s	758.6	 We've moved back here just to give her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=760.1s	760.1	 some more general exposure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=761.4s	761.4	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=763.3s	763.3	 Sit, yes, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=766.4s	766.4	 Good, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=769.2s	769.2	 Hey, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=770.2s	770.2	 Yeah, wait, stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=774.0s	774.0	 All right, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=777.1s	777.1	 That's the ultimate test to see if you can get her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=779.0s	779.0	 to pay attention in this environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=780.5s	780.5	 That was a good effort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=781.5s	781.5	 Even though this is a mega distracting environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=784.2s	784.2	 for Inersha, she's still able to do some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=786.2s	786.2	 of her more advanced tricks, and that is a good sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=789.7s	789.7	 I think she fits in great in New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=791.7s	791.7	 I'm actually having to deal with confetti over here too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=794.4s	794.4	 Another wonderful public distraction, confetti,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=797.1s	797.1	 falling from the sky unexpectedly out of nowhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=800.8s	800.8	 I'd say she's passing the test though, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=803.3s	803.3	 There's a dog over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=804.4s	804.4	 Let me see if I can walk her parallel to the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=806.8s	806.8	 I have these two fences between us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=808.9s	808.9	 It's a pretty reasonable distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=810.6s	810.6	 Let's see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=811.6s	811.6	 Easy, come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=813.5s	813.5	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=815.4s	815.4	 Oh, easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Sm3MJOU1U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=284&pp=iAQB&t=816.5s	816.5	 This way, come on.
