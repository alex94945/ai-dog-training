https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 How many tricks or behaviors does your dog know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=21.4s	21.4	 Tell me in the comments below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=22.6s	22.6	 Amy, how old is Benye?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 And you've had him since he was a puppy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 The first thing I did was YouTube tricks and I came across your videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=31.6s	31.6	 I just kind of used that as like my main source with like how to teach Benye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 When I saw you guys work together, you were in one of my classes, I was really inspired
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=40.3s	40.3	 by how well all of you connect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=42.8s	42.8	 What I was hoping we would do today is we would cover like maybe three of his best tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 What's kind of an easy-ish trick that you've taught him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=50.1s	50.1	 One of the first tricks I taught him was roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=52.2s	52.2	 So maybe you can give us a demo of roll over and kind of show us what you went through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=56.7s	56.7	 to teach it with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=58.6s	58.6	 Did you lure him into a roll over?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=60.9s	60.9	 Is that kind of how you taught him this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=62.4s	62.4	 I find that that's usually the easiest way to teach a roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 That was the only way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=66.3s	66.3	 So Benye loves his treats and so if you just lure him with the treat, which is what I did,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=73.8s	73.8	 and kind of have him follow and sniff the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 I like how you're leaning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=79.2s	79.2	 I'm trying to like get down to his level, eye level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=85.7s	85.7	 Nice job, roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 So that's kind of how you went about teaching it in the beginning, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 Just a basic lure and you would say roll over at one point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=91.9s	91.9	 So once he got like a full turn, then I would say roll over and then he would associate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=96.2s	96.2	 the word with that trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 Can you just be like roll over, just like standing normal now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 Down, roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 And you can see that's what you've worked up to, just being able to say roll over like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=105.9s	105.9	 that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=106.9s	106.9	 That's such a stellar example of really fluid communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 What is another trick that you taught him that seems to be a crowd pleaser?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=122.9s	122.9	 Everyone seems to love bang, which is play dead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=125.4s	125.4	 Why don't you run me through the steps that it took to teach Benye to play dead?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 First I got him to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 I kind of had to lure him to lay on his side like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 So cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=135.8s	135.8	 And then I said bang.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=143.8s	143.8	 And then you would like tell him to stay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 Yeah, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=147.8s	147.8	 And then?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 Bang!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=150.8s	150.8	 And so he stays there until I give him okay to release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=155.2s	155.2	 Bang!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-d2iesDZU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=588&pp=iAQB&t=157.2s	157.2	 You're dead.
