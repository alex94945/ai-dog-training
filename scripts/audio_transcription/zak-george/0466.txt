https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=28.7s	28.7	 We adopted Hank four months ago.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=37.6s	37.6	 Zach, can you help me connect with Hank?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=39.6s	39.6	 Julia, I totally understand what you mean about having issues with connecting with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=44.1s	44.1	 I mean, it takes time to build communication when you get a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 So I've got a couple of things that I'd like to cover with you and Hank today that I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=50.4s	50.4	 will get us all on the same page.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=51.9s	51.9	 What do you say?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=52.9s	52.9	 That sounds good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=53.9s	53.9	 I was looking at your YouTube channel and I noticed that you like to shop a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 Yeah, I really like shopping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=59.4s	59.4	 I find teaching your dog is a lot like finding a good sale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=62.5s	62.5	 Once you get on a roll, you just start getting one success after another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 So I was thinking we'd start off with something pretty easy today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=68.7s	68.7	 So with most dogs, if you have a treat and you put it right at their nose, you can kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 of move them back and forth just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=75.8s	75.8	 Because look, as long as we got a treat, he's like, I'm interested in that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 He'll follow that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 This is a great way to build communication in the very beginning because we have something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=83.3s	83.3	 they want and it gets their interest in us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=85.5s	85.5	 Do you think you can take what I just went over and teach him how to spin around in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 circle?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=90.1s	90.1	 Yeah, I think I'll be able to try it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=91.1s	91.1	 Doing a good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=92.1s	92.1	 It's a little awkward at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=93.1s	93.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=94.1s	94.1	 So let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=95.1s	95.1	 So it's going to probably look once we get them up like this, you got to really stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 So you might have to walk a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=100.1s	100.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 Let's see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=102.1s	102.1	 Right, so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=103.1s	103.1	 Yep, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=104.1s	104.1	 You got him into and up by calling him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=106.5s	106.5	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 Excellent job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 Fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=109.5s	109.5	 You got him to follow a treat in a circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=110.5s	110.5	 That can be a pretty fun trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=111.5s	111.5	 You're teaching him how to think, which is always a good thing when you're training a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=114.1s	114.1	 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 Let's try something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=116.7s	116.7	 I love that you're ready to get into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 How about we try teaching him lie down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=120.5s	120.5	 That was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 And you're doing great on only rewarding him when he's doing the things you like and you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=124.8s	124.8	 withholding the reward when he's being pushy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 It looks like when you were working with him on lie down, he was kind of poking his butt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 up in the air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 Now, to me, that's looking like a pretty good deal on bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 I'd like to see if we could get him to do that on cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=136.1s	136.1	 The main thing is that you want to reward him before he goes into the down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=140.1s	140.1	 So that way, if we do this enough, he'll start to differentiate between lie down and bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=144.2s	144.2	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=146.2s	146.2	 He started to bow, but I'd like him to kind of hold that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 So this is where timing, it's so delicate and it's so important to get your timing right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=153.2s	153.2	 Get him back into an up by lowering him like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=154.8s	154.8	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 And then down, bow, treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=157.2s	157.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=159.2s	159.2	 It's not about just teaching those tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 You're building really intricate communication between you and Hank.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 And I think that's what's going to really make all the difference moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=168.4s	168.4	 And he's holding the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 You are natural at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=170.4s	170.4	 That looked great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=171.7s	171.7	 That was really cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=172.7s	172.7	 If we could teach him how to jump over your body back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 Yeah, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 Here's your treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 And so I'm thinking if you could just maybe stand out, you know, sit like that and just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=182.1s	182.1	 encourage him to kind of jump over your legs with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=184.6s	184.6	 Let's see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 Get his attention there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=187.6s	187.6	 And then yes, go ahead and give him a little reward just for trying there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=191.4s	191.4	 You know, just a little piece.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=193.1s	193.1	 Excellent job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=194.1s	194.1	 And so not exactly a jump, but he's walking over you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=196.7s	196.7	 So that's a start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=198.1s	198.1	 Maybe he might do a proper hop over you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=201.3s	201.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXd8M8cKrhI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=202.3s	202.3	 Good job.
