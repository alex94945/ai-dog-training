https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 I've got just three weeks to train her and set her up for the most well-behaved life

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 That means I need to work on the most common puppy issues like potty training, how to actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=18.8s	18.8	 pay attention, stopping things like play biting, chewing, separation anxiety, getting along
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=23.9s	23.9	 with other animals, leash walking and teaching her everything a good dog needs to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=28.8s	28.8	 Real dog training doesn't always go smoothly and that's why I'm going to show you every

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 and teaching those fundamental things, just like we're doing with Kona in this series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=51.3s	51.3	 I want to make sure that all of you know about the totally free digital dog training course

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=78.1s	78.1	 In many ways it's actually better than taking an in-person dog training class.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=107.3s	107.3	 So that's what we're going to work on today, among other things, with a lovely Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=112.7s	112.7	 But teaching your dog to be very reliable about coming to you every time you call them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=116.7s	116.7	 or close to it can take a ton of commitment on your part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=119.8s	119.8	 We want to avoid calling Kona around heavy distractions, so we're going to start in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 super basic environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 And if she does well, we'll up the difficulty and see how she does around more distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=130.5s	130.5	 Because ultimately that's when come when called really matters is when they're distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=134.7s	134.7	 Let's get her a little warmed up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=136.5s	136.5	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 ignore you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=152.1s	152.1	 Right now she sees I have treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=153.9s	153.9	 You can see she's coming to me without me even asking, and that's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 I don't like the jumping so much, so I'm going to ask for a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=160.9s	160.9	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=161.9s	161.9	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=165.9s	165.9	 when called.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 a stern voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 Kona!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 And then I got a little more animated and you saw how she came running to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=183.7s	183.7	 So that's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=184.7s	184.7	 This is where we start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=185.7s	185.7	 Kona!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 Kona, come!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=198.9s	198.9	 going to come to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 But don't get too fixated on what words you should use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 Just focus on doing what it takes to get them to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=205.4s	205.4	 In other words, we don't want to overuse the word come if they're not coming to us reliably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=209.4s	209.4	 So only say that when you're reasonably confident that they're actually going to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=212.8s	212.8	 I'm going to take off the leash now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=214.2s	214.2	 I'm feeling pretty confident that she's paying attention, but I can still easily get to her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=217.9s	217.9	 if she starts running around the house too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=222.7s	222.7	 Kona!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=237.7s	237.7	 Most dogs don't seem to really enjoy being pet very rough.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=245.4s	245.4	 we're dealing with.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=335.1s	335.1	 Gently escort her back to where I'm calling her from in the same way that I would do with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=338.3s	338.3	 a young child who isn't coming when I call them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=349.3s	349.3	 And if your dog's already gotten into this habit, just take a step back and start being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=353.8s	353.8	 consistent.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=368.5s	368.5	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=373.7s	373.7	 a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=374.7s	374.7	 But don't be too strict in those early lessons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=376.5s	376.5	 This is literally her first lesson with me on come when called.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=379.7s	379.7	 Okay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=382.7s	382.7	 Another hack with training her dog to coming to you is running from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=387.1s	387.1	 Puppies especially like to chase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 So rather than chasing them down in the event you do find yourself where they're off leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=392.9s	392.9	 if you can get their attention on you and encourage them to come to you, that's always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=396.0s	396.0	 good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=401.6s	401.6	 Gonna ask for a sit before she jumps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=404.1s	404.1	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=408.2s	408.2	 rather than being the strict disciplinarian all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=411.2s	411.2	 And with those core skills like come and stay, you don't want to skimp on rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=415.8s	415.8	 I like using some variation of real meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=418.7s	418.7	 Today I'm using virtually pure freeze dried liver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=421.6s	421.6	 She's really loving them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=423.1s	423.1	 So make sure you're using a high quality reward or motivator with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=428.4s	428.4	 As you're hanging around and living life with your dog, make sure that every time they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=432.8s	432.8	 come to you, you find a way to give them a great consequence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=436.8s	436.8	 In our case, we have food rewards in every room in the house that we can easily get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=441.0s	441.0	 when I spontaneously call Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 And you'll want to do this for longer than you think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=445.4s	445.4	 I would say for the first year of life, really go all out and make sure you're providing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=450.1s	450.1	 an amazing reward very close to 100% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=454.1s	454.1	 Come Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=456.7s	456.7	 Getting low to the ground like this can be very beneficial as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=461.5s	461.5	 When they can see your eyes and see your face, you're a little more inviting to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=464.9s	464.9	 So that's another tip for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=468.7s	468.7	 Good job, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=469.7s	469.7	 And so now you can see she's coming to me by default here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=473.2s	473.2	 I'm not even asking and she's just following me around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=476.5s	476.5	 I sure do like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=479.3s	479.3	 But as I said, I mean, this is an easy version of come when called and this is where everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=483.1s	483.1	 needs to start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=484.1s	484.1	 But I think we can challenge Kona a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=486.7s	486.7	 As we mentioned countless times outside is much tougher for a dog if for no other reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=492.1s	492.1	 other than the different scents, the different sites, the different smells they encounter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=496.3s	496.3	 It's just a dramatically different environment for a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=499.2s	499.2	 So they're probably not going to be as responsive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=501.5s	501.5	 Let's get a baseline and see how Kona is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=503.6s	503.6	 Kona, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=505.6s	505.6	 Reluctant to go on the wet grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=507.4s	507.4	 So it looks like Kona will run right up to me the second I'm on the pavement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=510.9s	510.9	 I want to make sure to give her a treat for that because she voluntarily came to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=514.7s	514.7	 And remember, Kona is sensitive to different textures beneath her feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=518.1s	518.1	 The pavement seems normal and fine, but she's not as comfortable with wet grass yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=522.3s	522.3	 Be patient and try to make things easier if your dog is a little thrown off like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=526.4s	526.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=527.4s	527.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=529.0s	529.0	 She took a roundabout way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=530.6s	530.6	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=806.4s	806.4	 So I'll continue to reinforce come when called for some time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=810.5s	810.5	 It's important with a young puppy to get them very comfortable with handling exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=815.1s	815.1	 You want them comfortable at the vet, the groomer, or maybe a young child comes up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=818.9s	818.9	 grabs them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=819.9s	819.9	 This shouldn't be a special or unusual occasion for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=823.5s	823.5	 So we want to make sure they're going to react well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=825.1s	825.1	 I'm going to show you some things that you can do regularly to get your dog really comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=828.6s	828.6	 with being handled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=829.6s	829.6	 But you do need to go out of your way to do these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=831.5s	831.5	 This isn't really optional.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=832.5s	832.5	 So I'm going to come over here and pick her up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=835.8s	835.8	 I'm going to do some conditioning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=837.5s	837.5	 By conditioning, I just mean I'm going to give her something that's desirable to her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=843.5s	843.5	 which in this case is a treat while I do some handling exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=847.0s	847.0	 Let's start with the ears here for a second and go real light.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=850.0s	850.0	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=853.8s	853.8	 I'm just trying to get her comfortable with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=856.2s	856.2	 I mean, I can't underestimate how important it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=858.8s	858.8	 Get your dog comfortable with being touched in a fairly roughish manner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=863.0s	863.0	 In Kona's case, her family has a new baby on the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=866.2s	866.2	 So getting her comfortable with having that tail pulled and even her fur roughed around

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=872.7s	872.7	 She's doing really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=873.7s	873.7	 Got those legs and toes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=876.4s	876.4	 She's all sensitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=877.4s	877.4	 I know it's ticklish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=878.4s	878.4	 My feet are ticklish too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=879.4s	879.4	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=886.4s	886.4	 Go into their ears a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=888.0s	888.0	 Touch their gums, their teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=889.8s	889.8	 Do your best to pretend you're a vet and do the exam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=892.4s	892.4	 They're going to want to look at those teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=893.6s	893.6	 They're going to want to touch your dog all over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=896.4s	896.4	 Kona is actually doing extremely well on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=898.7s	898.7	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=899.7s	899.7	 She's not very bitey at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=900.7s	900.7	 And I'm doing all these handling exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=902.6s	902.6	 She seems to be enjoying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=904.4s	904.4	 And it's for good reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=905.7s	905.7	 We're going out of our way to provide something that's really enjoyable to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=910.0s	910.0	 In this case, these sweet potato treats really go a long way to show her that, hey, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=914.4s	914.4	 is something you should look forward to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=916.2s	916.2	 That's something you can do a few times a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=917.9s	917.9	 You don't need to do it for an hour at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=919.6s	919.6	 Just a few minutes here, a few minutes there should do the trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=921.8s	921.8	 And we don't want to wait till it's time to go to the vet or the groomer to just work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=925.7s	925.7	 on this stuff the night before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=927.3s	927.3	 So focus on doing this well ahead of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=929.7s	929.7	 I have yet to brush Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=932.1s	932.1	 So let's see how she does with the brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=933.8s	933.8	 When a lot of people brush their dog for the first time, what do they do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=936.2s	936.2	 They just kind of go right into it, don't they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=938.4s	938.4	 And try to get the job done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=939.8s	939.8	 But it's much better to prep your dog to be brushed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=943.6s	943.6	 I mean, you can see how that would throw off a dog for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=946.6s	946.6	 There's these little bristles being rubbed on their skin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=949.6s	949.6	 That's got to feel a little different at the very least, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=952.8s	952.8	 Kona!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=954.8s	954.8	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=958.8s	958.8	 Come, it's looking good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=960.8s	960.8	 So let's pick her back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=962.2s	962.2	 So I've got some treats in my hand here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=963.7s	963.7	 Again, the sweet potato treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=965.0s	965.0	 So I want to make sure that these are on standby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=967.2s	967.2	 I'm going to let her check out the brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=969.3s	969.3	 Let her smell it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=973.3s	973.3	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=975.3s	975.3	 I'm going to touch her with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=978.8s	978.8	 Maybe right here on the neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=980.2s	980.2	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=982.2s	982.2	 I'm just focused on getting her comfortable with the brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=984.8s	984.8	 This is, I'm trying to prevent a brush phobia in the future by going extra slow and extra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=990.5s	990.5	 gentle.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=996.5s	996.5	 I'm just going real soft, letting her know what that stroking motion feels like here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1002.1s	1002.1	 Giving her small pieces of sweet potato as I do it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1014.3s	1014.3	 The objective is simply to get her comfortable with the motion here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1021.0s	1021.0	 And the texture and the feeling and all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1024.2s	1024.2	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1038.5s	1038.5	 Now that we're starting to really build some communication, I want to start introducing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1041.8s	1041.8	 the concept of some basic tricks to Kona as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1045.3s	1045.3	 We already know she knows things like sit and lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1048.8s	1048.8	 We talked about lure training a few lessons ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1051.0s	1051.0	 Remember?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1052.0s	1052.0	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1053.0s	1053.0	 You can do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1054.0s	1054.0	 And that's looking good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1055.0s	1055.0	 I think roll over would be a great trick to start with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1057.8s	1057.8	 And we can do this by luring her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1060.0s	1060.0	 Remember luring is where you use a treat to coax your dog into a physical position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1065.2s	1065.2	 So in this case, we're going to keep that treat really glued to her nose because remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1069.7s	1069.7	 lure training is still new to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1071.2s	1071.2	 I'm going to do some experimentation here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1073.8s	1073.8	 Trying to get her to do a roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1074.9s	1074.9	 It looks like she's not quite in the right position for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1077.6s	1077.6	 So we want her in a down to start off with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1080.3s	1080.3	 See, I'm just holding it here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1083.4s	1083.4	 There we go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1087.4s	1087.4	 It takes a little bit of experimentation, but a lot of it's in the wrist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1091.5s	1091.5	 Believe it or not.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1096.9s	1096.9	 with it here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1097.9s	1097.9	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1102.0s	1102.0	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1105.6s	1105.6	 Let's see if we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1106.6s	1106.6	 Yes, roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1109.1s	1109.1	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1110.2s	1110.2	 So we got a complete roll over there or complete enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1112.5s	1112.5	 See if we can get her going in the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1115.0s	1115.0	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1117.7s	1117.7	 Notice the treat isn't way out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1119.4s	1119.4	 You see that it's really I'm letting her nibble on it and she's starting to adopt a bit of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1123.7s	1123.7	 a soft bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1124.7s	1124.7	 So this is having the added benefit of teaching her to bite more softly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1129.0s	1129.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1131.0s	1131.0	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1135.5s	1135.5	 We're going to lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1137.3s	1137.3	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1140.7s	1140.7	 So it makes more sense to go this this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1144.4s	1144.4	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1147.7s	1147.7	 Did you see that?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47GMmiew1I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=1165.2s	1165.2	 pop into that up position.
