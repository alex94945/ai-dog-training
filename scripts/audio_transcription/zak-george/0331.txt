https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 In the early days of training your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 it's important to try a variety of treats

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=54.3s	54.3	 These are great because they're freeze-dried.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=55.8s	55.8	 They keep well at room temperature,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=57.1s	57.1	 so they have the flavor and the nutrients,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=58.9s	58.9	 and they don't have a bunch of crazy ingredients in them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 So 100% sweet potato, 95% beef liver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 The other 5% is pea protein to hold it all together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=67.8s	67.8	 Inertia, you 100% have to stop chewing on my shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 You can get these Pupford treats right now

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=78.9s	78.9	 with shoelaces, pants legs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=83.2s	83.2	 I think we should work on teaching her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=85.4s	85.4	 that this is inappropriate behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 Oh, Inertia, you're gonna make me work, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 There's a couple of ways to handle this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=91.3s	91.3	 Number one, ideally you want to encourage your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 to sit and stay and be nice and calm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 before they even think about going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 for someone's pant leg or shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=100.1s	100.1	 With an eight-week-old puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 you're still building communication,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=102.5s	102.5	 so you can't perfect this quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 This is gonna take some time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 I think protocol here is to get Inertia's attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 off of this and onto something that I'd rather she do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=110.4s	110.4	 Maybe sit or lie down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 or maybe even do some trick training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 All she's really saying when she does this is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=115.2s	115.2	 hey, I wanna play, I wanna do something, this is fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 So let's give her something else to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=118.9s	118.9	 What I'm gonna do is first get her attention off of my leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=123.2s	123.2	 I'm gonna ask for a sit before giving her the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=128.5s	128.5	 You win something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 To be clear, I'm rewarding the sit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 not the biting on the pants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=132.7s	132.7	 What I like to do when a dog is that interested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=135.1s	135.1	 in engaging with me is jump into some training like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 We're working on sit and down right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 and we've decided that we're gonna try calling up sit now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=143.8s	143.8	 Boy, she got wild just as you started filming here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 Ow, oh my gosh, yep, my arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=148.2s	148.2	 That bite's getting stronger by the day here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Sit, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 Down, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 Okay, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=155.7s	155.7	 And the okay is just to let her know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=156.9s	156.9	 that the down is over in that case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=161.2s	161.2	 We're gonna continue working on those drills
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=163.1s	163.1	 until they're second nature to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=164.7s	164.7	 So I'm gonna give her a break right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=165.9s	165.9	 She's getting a little bit frustrated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 as is very normal for a young dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=169.3s	169.3	 and it's important not to push them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 through frustration too much, not at this age anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 And it's really on us to keep things really fun for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 If they're not having fun,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=212.7s	212.7	 So she's very clear on when she can get up in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=216.7s	216.7	 because dramatic long play deads can be fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 Play dead.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 That can be very frustrating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=224.6s	224.6	 I'm just ignoring it and getting her back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 onto the training session here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=227.4s	227.4	 letting her know what will work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=230.4s	230.4	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=232.9s	232.9	 I mean, it was as though she was like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=233.7s	233.7	 what do I have to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 That thing I was just doing a second ago?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=236.1s	236.1	 At which time I was like, yeah, that's what you need to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=238.3s	238.3	 That's what's gonna get you what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=239.7s	239.7	 Even though Inersha is only eight weeks old,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=241.8s	241.8	 I think it's a good idea to start working on teaching her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=244.4s	244.4	 how to be polite when she gets pet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 I've got an opportunity here with our associate producer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=248.9s	248.9	 and we're gonna work on some training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=250.2s	250.2	 Gonna invite Inersha over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 Be excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 Make it tempting for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=253.5s	253.5	 I wanna see if she'll jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=254.4s	254.4	 I mean, let's see what her default is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=256.8s	256.8	 So maybe even stand up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 Hi, pooby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 So if you stand up and you go to pet her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=261.3s	261.3	 all right, stop petting her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 And now start petting her again really excitedly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=264.7s	264.7	 I just, okay, so, you know, this isn't very polite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 She's chewing on your shoe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 See if she wants that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=270.6s	270.6	 I'm just gonna try to redirect her for a second there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 All right, go ahead and pet her now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 I'm just gonna stay on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=275.0s	275.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 I like that she's holding her sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=277.6s	277.6	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 Sorry, going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=285.8s	285.8	 Right now she's a little too persistent on the shoes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=288.4s	288.4	 Go ahead and take a step back right now, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 Thanks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=290.8s	290.8	 Since we're still in the communication building phase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=292.8s	292.8	 for at least the next couple of months,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=294.7s	294.7	 management is extra important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=296.6s	296.6	 So having a puppy on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 until sufficient communication is built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=299.9s	299.9	 is a practical way to manage your dog's unwanted behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=303.6s	303.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=304.4s	304.4	 Right here, she's offering a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=305.8s	305.8	 So I'm just gonna go ahead and treat her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=308.9s	308.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=309.8s	309.8	 And after you get done tying your shoes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=310.8s	310.8	 just come and pet her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=311.6s	311.6	 If she starts to go for your shoes, just back away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=313.8s	313.8	 Here, I'm just rewarding her for holding this calm position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 Now back away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=318.0s	318.0	 Yep, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=318.9s	318.9	 Appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=319.8s	319.8	 Now you would also have the option
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 to back your dog away as well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=322.5s	322.5	 but I know that she knows what I want done here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=324.8s	324.8	 after editing enough of these videos, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=327.8s	327.8	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=330.2s	330.2	 Now maybe two strokes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 Perfect, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=333.4s	333.4	 And so we're not getting any shoe biting here or jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=336.3s	336.3	 Much more polite behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=338.1s	338.1	 Pretty good for a first session, I'd say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=339.8s	339.8	 It should be noted that an eight week old puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=341.6s	341.6	 needs lots of socialization with people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=343.9s	343.9	 So don't be too strict about good manners in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 I'm more or less just planting the seed for future training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=349.9s	349.9	 but for the time being,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=351.1s	351.1	 I'm going to be relatively permissive about jumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=353.8s	353.8	 as I want inertia to love people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=356.0s	356.0	 Having your dog come to you is an essential skill,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=358.3s	358.3	 so always be very stern and use a serious deep tone of voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=365.4s	365.4	 Okay, just kidding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=366.6s	366.6	 The goofier you act and the higher pitched your voice is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=369.4s	369.4	 the better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=370.3s	370.3	 I wanted to play the come, win, call game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=371.3s	371.3	 you know, where you throw a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=372.3s	372.3	 and they have to come back to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=373.3s	373.3	 because very often when you're working with a puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 they're just stuck to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=376.9s	376.9	 or they're tuned out doing something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=378.9s	378.9	 I just want to start teaching her this whole concept
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=381.0s	381.0	 of coming to me when I call her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=384.0s	384.0	 Inertia, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=385.1s	385.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=386.6s	386.6	 And I'm just going to either say, Inertia, Inertia, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=388.8s	388.8	 I wanted to know what both of them mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 I'm not too worried about confusing her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=391.6s	391.6	 Inertia, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=397.9s	397.9	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 That was a good example of resisting the urge to say,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=581.5s	581.5	 If she wants to just lay down and chill out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=583.9s	583.9	 that's fine with me too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=589.0s	589.0	 when she's in a mellow state like that as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=591.0s	591.0	 Crate training can be a very delicate process,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=593.6s	593.6	 and I'm still trying to create a positive association
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=596.2s	596.2	 with her crate over the next few days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=598.2s	598.2	 Today I'm working on teaching inertia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=600.2s	600.2	 how to get comfortable going into her crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=602.3s	602.3	 trying to encourage her to go into the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=604.5s	604.5	 So I'm going to toss a treat here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=605.6s	605.6	 as soon as she gives me her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=607.1s	607.1	 The key with crate training is to get your dog willingly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=609.6s	609.6	 and voluntarily going into their crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=611.7s	611.7	 So use treats they love and take it slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=619.9s	619.9	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=623.5s	623.5	 I'm going to continue to click her for hanging out in here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=626.6s	626.6	 for duration, just to keep her in there voluntarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=630.0s	630.0	 Not going to shut the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=631.2s	631.2	 I want her to know that being in here is a great thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=634.4s	634.4	 These are crumb sized treats here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=636.8s	636.8	 And since I'm using such small treats that she likes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=639.9s	639.9	 I'm able to really give her tons and tons of treats here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=642.9s	642.9	 without fear of her getting overweight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=645.1s	645.1	 So basically step one is getting her to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=647.6s	647.6	 into the crate voluntarily,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=652.6s	652.6	 Ultimately what I'm going for is a settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=654.7s	654.7	 Look, she just came out of the crate there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=656.6s	656.6	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=660.5s	660.5	 What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=662.0s	662.0	 Right here, inertia come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=664.0s	664.0	 Good, see how I wasn't saying inertia come,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=667.0s	667.0	 she's not supposed to be off leash right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=669.0s	669.0	 We were just going to change her collar out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=670.7s	670.7	 but anyway, it's the position I find myself in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=673.0s	673.0	 She's starting to respond to hand signals here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=674.8s	674.8	 just by me putting my hand out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=677.2s	677.2	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=683.2s	683.2	 Really capturing that is important.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=690.5s	690.5	 because she's not quite going into the down on her own,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=692.9s	692.9	 but I'm going to just lure her right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vTyXCP5vY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=332&pp=iAQB&t=695.0s	695.0	 Good job.
