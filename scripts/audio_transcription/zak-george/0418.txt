https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=21.1s	21.1	 If you've ever had a puppy biter,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 when they start biting you can be really hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 For some reason, he'd still prefer to bite my flesh,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 my watch even.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=30.2s	30.2	 Why would you wanna chew a watch?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=31.6s	31.6	 Now, sometimes you just have to make the toy more exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 or maybe just get a more exciting toy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=38.1s	38.1	 That way, you don't have to bite on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 It's already working, this is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=41.8s	41.8	 If you would just be a little patient,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 you just go ahead and do it yourself.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=47.6s	47.6	 He's not biting me anymore, this is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=49.5s	49.5	 I like that he's biting this instead.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 From a dog training perspective,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 one of the cool things about a toy like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=57.9s	57.9	 is the wings right here are crinkly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=59.3s	59.3	 but the rest of the toy is normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 There's even a squeak in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=62.9s	62.9	 Squirrel Lancelot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=64.7s	64.7	 It's amazing how a new toy can spark a dog's interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=67.2s	67.2	 in training and playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=68.2s	68.2	 That makes BarkBox worth it all by itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=70.1s	70.1	 So they claim these treats are good for training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=71.8s	71.8	 Sit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 You don't even need me, just get a BarkBox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 They don't even smell like dog treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 If you didn't know they were dog treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=78.4s	78.4	 you'd probably eat one yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=79.5s	79.5	 It's better without the plastic, man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=81.1s	81.1	 You tell BarkBox your dog's size,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 how tough a chewer they are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 and any dietary preferences that apply to your dog,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=99.9s	99.9	 There are two main ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=100.8s	100.8	 that you wanna communicate with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 You wanna teach them how to respond to hand signals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=104.7s	104.7	 as well as the spoken word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=107.2s	107.2	 For example, you might be talking on the phone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 and you wanna just be able to subtly tell your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 hey, lie down and stay without having to say anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 Also in some situations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=114.9s	114.9	 some dogs respond better to words
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=117.5s	117.5	 than to words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=118.4s	118.4	 and others to hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 This varies from dog to dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 and even within the same dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=121.5s	121.5	 For example, some dogs will be more responsive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 to something like sit with a hand signal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 but if you tell them to stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=126.7s	126.7	 they're more likely to do so with a verbal signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=128.8s	128.8	 See, if your dog becomes accustomed to listening to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=131.5s	131.5	 and looking to you for direction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=133.1s	133.1	 it's gonna be a lot easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 to generally communicate with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=136.3s	136.3	 You'll find that hand signals tend to evolve and emerge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 from just natural interaction with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 For example, a lot of you might have taught your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 how to sit by kind of luring them back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=146.2s	146.2	 just like that, sit, good job,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 and that might have turned into, hey, sit like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=151.8s	151.8	 and ultimately many of you can probably get your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=153.7s	153.7	 to sit just by doing that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 That's a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=157.2s	157.2	 In this case, you don't go from the lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=159.2s	159.2	 to your final hand signal all in one motion,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=161.8s	161.8	 you slowly evolve it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=163.2s	163.2	 When it comes time to decide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=164.3s	164.3	 what kind of hand signal you want to use,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=165.8s	165.8	 you can make them up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=166.7s	166.7	 Use any hand signal that's natural to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 Now let's take stay next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=170.7s	170.7	 I probably use this hand signal more than anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 I mean, it's like a giant stop sign for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 As a general rule of thumb,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=176.7s	176.7	 it's a good idea to accompany your hand signal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=178.7s	178.7	 and the word you're trying to teach them simultaneously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 so that they can begin to equate both of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=183.3s	183.3	 to mean the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 Stay, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=186.9s	186.9	 There's that little motion to stay that you kind of do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 just bringing a lot of movement to, okay, that's not stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=193.1s	193.1	 I find that making big exaggerated signals at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=196.5s	196.5	 can really get hand signal training off to a great start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 You want to evolve that hand signal, probably,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 into something a little bit more casual,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 so you don't look ridiculous.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=209.2s	209.2	 Once your dog is staying with a stay like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=212.7s	212.7	 now maybe you might want to do, hey, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=216.1s	216.1	 Good, now let's see if he'll do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 without me even saying anything,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 because you want to be able to use them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 both interchangeably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=223.6s	223.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=224.6s	224.6	 Mars is learning how to speak,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=228.8s	228.8	 Usually when I teach a dog to speak,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=230.3s	230.3	 I'll hold up the treat until they say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=231.9s	231.9	 hey, give me that treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=233.2s	233.2	 Of course, I'll reward them for vocalizing it first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 So my goal here is to see if I can get him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 to reliably speak when I hold it up like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=239.2s	239.2	 and then I'm going to try to evolve that hand signal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=241.2s	241.2	 into something a little bit more creative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 Yes, I'll take that, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 Yes, speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=249.1s	249.1	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=251.0s	251.0	 Speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 Excellent, he's really speaking reliably here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=259.7s	259.7	 when I have a treat in my hand and I say, speak like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 I'd like to see if I could get him to speak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 when I go, speak like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=267.3s	267.3	 Speak, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 Did you see how I kind of moved my fingers a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=270.7s	270.7	 to try and phase it in right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=272.4s	272.4	 Right as he was doing it, to let him know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 they kind of mean the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 Speak, good job, very nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=280.8s	280.8	 Yeah, that was a little bit of a speak there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=282.8s	282.8	 I like that, I think he's starting to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 Yeah, I'll take it, that's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=289.9s	289.9	 Yes, you're getting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 Yes, sometimes you might find that it's really easy too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=296.8s	296.8	 to use an existing hand signal that your dog already knows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=299.6s	299.6	 For example, Mars over here knows how to shake hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=302.4s	302.4	 When I put out my hand like this for shake,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=304.4s	304.4	 he's like, oh, I know what that means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=305.9s	305.9	 Wave is where they lift up their paw,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=307.3s	307.3	 but they're not actually making contact with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=309.2s	309.2	 So that was almost good, I'm going to reward that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 But we're going to use that to show him how to wave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=314.5s	314.5	 See, if I just do that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=315.5s	315.5	 he doesn't know what I'm talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=317.6s	317.6	 Wave, good, did you see what I did there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=319.4s	319.4	 Kind of psyched him out a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 and gave him a different hand signal to look at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=323.1s	323.1	 And wave, good, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=325.9s	325.9	 He's anticipating the shake,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=327.7s	327.7	 but I'm pulling my hand out at the last second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=330.4s	330.4	 Wave, good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=342.2s	342.2	 from humans much better than wolves raised by humans,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIXaNdgCFQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=419&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 You really seem starting to get it now.
