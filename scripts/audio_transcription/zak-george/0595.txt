https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6j4lawg9L4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 there's a bit of regression.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6j4lawg9L4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 Just because a dog does really well in their home environment doesn't mean they're going

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6j4lawg9L4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 What do you think?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6j4lawg9L4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 in the new environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6j4lawg9L4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 Sit, lie down, maybe you can throw a trick or two in there later on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6j4lawg9L4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=134.9s	134.9	 And then if she does well here, we'll graduate over there to the dog park and see how responsive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6j4lawg9L4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 she is in listening to us around other dogs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6j4lawg9L4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=161.8s	161.8	 So we're going to see if we can get her to do her basics for a ball in the distracting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6j4lawg9L4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 environment.
