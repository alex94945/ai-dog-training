https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 This comes from YouTuber The Solid Drawing, who asks, can you teach older dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=91.3s	91.3	 In short, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 Whoever said you can't teach an old dog new tricks obviously wasn't a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=97.8s	97.8	 And if they were, they weren't very good because they would know better than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=100.8s	100.8	 In the same way that an older person can learn how to play a piano, how to read, how to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 algebra or any of those tasks typically common to younger people, so too can a dog learn

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=119.9s	119.9	 who have to deal with this stereotype.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=127.2s	127.2	 a couple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 Number one, you don't have to deal with a lot of the lack of focus that really young
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 puppies have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=133.9s	133.9	 You have a dog that's experienced the world who has a clue about many things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=137.5s	137.5	 Of course, you also have a lot of dogs who are a little bit older who are pretty savvy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=142.8s	142.8	 and they kind of know when you mean it and when you don't and they'll call your bluff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=146.2s	146.2	 if they know you're not the very consistent type of trainer, which is a good time to remind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=151.1s	151.1	 you that one of the most important factors if you want a dog that listens to you is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 be very, very consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 If your dog doesn't listen to you the first time, you need to take that time to stop what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=161.9s	161.9	 you're doing, work with them and show them exactly what you mean and that you expect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 them to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=168.1s	168.1	 But you want to find every opportunity to reward them and communicate to them very genuinely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=172.9s	172.9	 that you appreciate it when they comply.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=175.8s	175.8	 That's important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=177.1s	177.1	 It's easy to get frustrated, but frustration has no place in teaching a dog if you hope
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=181.8s	181.8	 to get fast results.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=185.3s	185.3	 We're going to move on to our next one now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=192.8s	192.8	 come when called, but only comes when I have a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=196.5s	196.5	 If he sees something more interesting, then he won't come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=200.4s	200.4	 You know, this makes total sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 In fact, all dogs go through this basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 Just as a quick reminder, remember if you have a young puppy, they're likely to come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=209.5s	209.5	 to you very easily and once they hit the age of about five months, that's when they start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=213.4s	213.4	 to slowly become less consistent with coming back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 So if you do have a young puppy, please remember that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=220.8s	220.8	 vital that you practice come when called very often in a huge variety of settings,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=226.5s	226.5	 circumstances and environments before you expect your dog to listen to you without treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=232.2s	232.2	 Don't be in a rush to get your dog off of treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=234.7s	234.7	 Now I will have a video in the description that will help you teach your dog how to listen

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=241.8s	241.8	 You're not entitled to a well-trained dog that comes to you every time in a huge variety

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=252.2s	252.2	 start taking come when called to the next level for some dogs, even up to a year of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=262.8s	262.8	 you have two options.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 might try using something like a squeaky toy to get your dog's attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=275.4s	275.4	 Try and be a little animated.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=283.2s	283.2	 prepared to have some energy, get exciting, and be worth coming to.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=291.8s	291.8	 then your next step is of course to go and get them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=294.5s	294.5	 Now I hear a lot of you out there saying, but my dog gets too far away and they're halfway

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=307.5s	307.5	 have not spent adequate time training come when called.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhJiS9F4jE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=560&pp=iAQB&t=331.3s	331.3	 it'll go something like, you know, I just got a new puppy.
