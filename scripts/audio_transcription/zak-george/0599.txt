https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today's video is brought to you by Turkish Airlines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=4.4s	4.4	 How many of you have ever had the issue of your puppy or dog biting at the leash?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=9.2s	9.2	 In today's video, I'm going to show you how to teach your dog to not bite on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=13.1s	13.1	 Now this is a super common habit with really young dogs in particular, but this habit can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=17.7s	17.7	 go well into adulthood if it goes unchecked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 It's quite simple to do and I'm going to show you how with Luna, the six month old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=23.9s	23.9	 border collie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=24.9s	24.9	 There are lots of suggestions out there as to how to deal with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 One of the more popular ones is spraying some type of gimmicky pet product on the leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=32.4s	32.4	 to make it taste bad or to use a metal leash instead of a cloth leash or nylon leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=38.6s	38.6	 We don't need to look for shortcuts, so we want to get out of that mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 The best, most authentic dog training occurs when we teach our dog to think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 Plus this improves overall communication between us and our dogs and when we have that, we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 can do anything we want with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=52.8s	52.8	 Now this is normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 A dog looks at this as a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 They don't know that a leash is designed to keep them safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 They might just think it's a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=59.5s	59.5	 So we want to discourage this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=60.9s	60.9	 Now the easiest and quickest way to do this, you should be using treats in general with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=65.4s	65.4	 your training in the beginning anyway, so you should have them on you on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=68.9s	68.9	 Usually a dog who's doing this will find great satisfaction by you pulling the leash or trying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=73.1s	73.1	 to pry it out of their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=74.6s	74.6	 They'll simply think you're joining in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 Remember tug of war is a very instinctive game for a dog to play and there are plenty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=81.6s	81.6	 of places for tug of war to really benefit your training, but this isn't one of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=85.2s	85.2	 The first thing we want to do is interrupt the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=87.9s	87.9	 You can see she's really into this right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 Now I've got Turkey over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=91.1s	91.1	 Okay, I'm going to break her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=92.7s	92.7	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 But I'm not going to reward for that because I don't want her to think I'm rewarding her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=96.7s	96.7	 for tugging on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 I'm going to ask her to sit and she knows a basic stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=102.1s	102.1	 If you don't know how to teach your dog to stay, you can see the description of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=104.4s	104.4	 video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 The reason I'm asking Luna to sit and stay is because I've worked with her for a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=108.9s	108.9	 I know that she's likely to get into training mode by asking her to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 That'll get her in the mood to learn a new concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=116.8s	116.8	 This could be as simple though as asking your dog to look at you, for example, if you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=119.8s	119.8	 taught them that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=120.8s	120.8	 However, if you haven't really done any basic or really initial beginner training with your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=125.2s	125.2	 dog, you're not ready to teach them this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 Now I'm going to attempt to take a walk, but I'm anticipating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 I know that she's likely to try and bite the leash again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=133.1s	133.1	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=134.1s	134.1	 If she tried to do it a moment ago, she'll probably try and do it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=136.1s	136.1	 So we're going to walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=137.1s	137.1	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 And actually she didn't bite the leash there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=140.3s	140.3	 So I'm going to reward her and let her know that I like that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=143.5s	143.5	 Come on girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=145.5s	145.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=146.5s	146.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 Come on over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=148.5s	148.5	 Keep walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=149.5s	149.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=150.5s	150.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=152.5s	152.5	 And right now I'm just walking back and forth, but I'm watching her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=154.7s	154.7	 I'm anticipating the fact that she might do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=156.9s	156.9	 I'm not just going to assume that it's fixed because she did it once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 Never do we train a behavior in one fell swoop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=162.5s	162.5	 You know, we train it in little bits and we have to be consistent over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=165.9s	165.9	 Once you feel like your dog is getting this basic concept, it's time to up the difficulty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=170.1s	170.1	 level a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 We want to interrupt their thought process the moment they think about biting the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 Wherever you can set up training exercises, you're going to be much better off because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 that means you are in a position to give all of your attention to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 Let the emphasis of all of your training be on yes, not no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=190.9s	190.9	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=191.9s	191.9	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 And I've already taught her watch me so I can get that attention onto me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=195.8s	195.8	 Watch me or look at me as a vital skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 You can see the description of this video if your dog doesn't know how to look at you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=201.2s	201.2	 when you ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 Okay, now she's now she's going at it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 So I've got to interrupt the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=204.4s	204.4	 I can use the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=205.4s	205.4	 Oh, that's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=206.4s	206.4	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 I'm just giving her a tiny bit of turkey there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 Nice work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 I was able to wiggle the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 She's learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 It's okay to be proactive like this and set your dog up so that you can teach them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=219.5s	219.5	 Leave this alone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=226.3s	226.3	 It's always ideal to catch the behavior right before it occurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 It's always ideal to correct these types of things right before they occur rather than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=231.9s	231.9	 waiting for the unwanted behavior to occur and then correct it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=235.3s	235.3	 If you can communicate to your dog that you like that they are not biting on the leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnm5c3xCqs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=600&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 rather than waiting for full on tug of war to break out, that is 10 times more effective
