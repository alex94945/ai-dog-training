https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=8.7s	8.7	 Thank you guys for being so patient with me over the last several months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=11.4s	11.4	 As you know, I've been working on my new book and that's been taking a lot of my time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 I'll give you more details on that in a future video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=18.4s	18.4	 What I thought I'd do today was go over some questions, a lot of the questions that I see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=22.1s	22.1	 repeated in one form or another, and try and give you some insight and guide you as to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 what to do if you're dealing with some of these issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=29.1s	29.1	 Make sure you click thumbs up for another dog training video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=32.3s	32.3	 Also subscribe so you see some of those awesome videos I'll be posting later on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 I have pretty strict criteria before I agree to work with many of the brands that you see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=41.3s	41.3	 on my YouTube channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=42.7s	42.7	 The main criteria that I apply is they must offer a way to make your life better and of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=46.7s	46.7	 course I must agree with the service or product that I'm endorsing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=50.9s	50.9	 In PetFlow's case, I've been working with them perhaps longer than any other sponsor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 I absolutely love their service because they truly make my life better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=58.9s	58.9	 I know firsthand with four dogs what it's like when you inadvertently run out of dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=63.7s	63.7	 food and you have to stop what you're doing, get in the car, drive across town, go get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=67.8s	67.8	 a 40 pound bag of dog food, bring it back, lug it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=71.3s	71.3	 For those of you that have already set up automatic pet food delivery from PetFlow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 you know that this solves a huge problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 PetFlow basically allows you to set up your dog food delivery every two to 16 weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=84.3s	84.3	 You choose the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=85.3s	85.3	 I do it every two weeks because we have a lot of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=87.5s	87.5	 Plus it's a fantastic way to support the dog training revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 I encourage you to take a look for yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=92.8s	92.8	 You decide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=93.8s	93.8	 Don't do it because I said to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 Make sure it's something you're comfortable with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=96.6s	96.6	 Of course, PetFlow lets you discontinue the automatic delivery anytime you want for any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=101.3s	101.3	 reason at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 So just check out petflow.com slash Zach George.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 though I'm sure one is coming because it's a fantastic topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 But how do you work with a deaf dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 I think that's a really good question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=125.9s	125.9	 You know, working with a deaf dog really isn't that different than working with a dog who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 has hearing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 There are some limitations, which I'll talk about in a second, but this really underscores
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=135.3s	135.3	 how important it is to teach with a lot of body language, a lot of signaling, which will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 morph into more proper hand signals later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=142.5s	142.5	 But to be engaging and be interesting doesn't require audio from your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=147.1s	147.1	 All the more reason also to prioritize look at me because you really have to make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 you can get their eyes on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 If you don't have your dog's eyes on you, you don't have the dog and you're not really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=157.1s	157.1	 ready to continue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 And most instances of beginner training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=161.9s	161.9	 Now out of sight stuff comes much later, but in the beginning you want to make sure that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 eye contact is super solid and you can easily do that with a deaf dog in exactly the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 way as you would with a non deaf dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=174.1s	174.1	 I'll have a link in the description that will show you how to teach your dog to look at

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 I'll also have a link in the description that will show you how to teach your dog all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 basics in order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=181.7s	181.7	 Now there are some limitations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 So with a deaf dog, if you're practicing a recall or you're practicing fetch, it's extra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 important to make sure you have them on a long lead and harness so that you can easily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=193.1s	193.1	 get control of them or give them a gentle tug to communicate with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=197.3s	197.3	 I'm not talking about a correction tug to be very clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=200.1s	200.1	 This next question comes from Tina and I'm going to paraphrase it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=202.7s	202.7	 My puppy is so hyperactive, it's almost impossible to get her to focus on training because she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=208.1s	208.1	 gets way too excited about food or play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 Boy, don't I understand that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=214.2s	214.2	 This is a fantastic problem to have by the way, because essentially what this means is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=218.3s	218.3	 you have a dog that's just overflowing with optimistic, curious energy, dying to interact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=222.8s	222.8	 with you and everything around them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 This is a good thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=226.1s	226.1	 Now of course, you know, you've got to refine that energy and transfer it to getting focused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=231.3s	231.3	 on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=232.3s	232.3	 Number one, make sure that you start off with something easy when you begin a new training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 session.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=240.5s	240.5	 of having a dog, start off with sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=242.4s	242.4	 Do that five, 10 times enough to really reward them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=246.0s	246.0	 Also, be very methodical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=248.2s	248.2	 You're the one that sets the pace, not them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=250.9s	250.9	 So if you're doing a sit with your dog and you're working with them and they're all jumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=254.2s	254.2	 on your hand trying to get it and looking behind them, just be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=257.5s	257.5	 Take a deep breath.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=263.7s	263.7	 It's a bit ironic, but when you get that point and you learn how to go slowly, you're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=268.3s	268.3	 to see much more significant progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=270.9s	270.9	 Be very mindful for those of you that have younger puppies as well, that puppies have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=274.9s	274.9	 very little life experience.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=281.6s	281.6	 them is a little bit unreasonable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=283.9s	283.9	 So you kind of have to pick and choose when you decide to just take a step back, let them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=289.4s	289.4	 do their own thing, and when you want to insist on training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=292.8s	292.8	 They're very good at making associations from when you were frustrated and the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=296.7s	296.7	 training isn't likely to be fun versus when you've gone out of your way to just be chill,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=301.6s	301.6	 work with them, be content with the results you get, regardless of how significant they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 are.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=311.2s	311.2	 you and give you a better performance each time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=322.6s	322.6	 This comes from Vicky.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=358.9s	358.9	 The fastest way to throw your dog off and confuse them is to change their environment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 for you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=410.6s	410.6	 So let them sniff around, let them get comfortable in the environment, let them acclimate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=414.7s	414.7	 I'll give you an example of this firsthand that I experienced just a few days ago.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=499.6s	499.6	 and level three energy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=502.5s	502.5	 You almost never need to exercise them before training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=506.0s	506.0	 And in general, there's a slight correlation with the advanced level stuff with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=511.8s	511.8	 They're a little bit more limited on super advanced stuff, but they're just more chill,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=515.9s	515.9	 more low key, not as driven dogs in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=519.3s	519.3	 Level two is probably what most of you have out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=521.9s	521.9	 They're probably the best of both worlds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=524.2s	524.2	 They can chill out when you want and they can play a few minutes of fetch at a time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=528.6s	528.6	 before they get totally bored with it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=533.3s	533.3	 Sadie was a level two dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z45gvql74Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=552&pp=iAQB&t=546.4s	546.4	 And it would be foolish for those of you with super hyper lab type puppies who are just
