https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3fTUbcJ1YY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=126&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 to process the request to come to you when you call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3fTUbcJ1YY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=126&pp=iAQB&t=21.4s	21.4	 And I want to be there to encourage her to come to me when she does look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3fTUbcJ1YY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=126&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 Come!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3fTUbcJ1YY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=126&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 So you see what I did there out of habit. I said come and I gave her a hand signal simultaneously.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3fTUbcJ1YY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=126&pp=iAQB&t=33.9s	33.9	 And she's like, how can I get something I want?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3fTUbcJ1YY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=126&pp=iAQB&t=36.1s	36.1	 Getting your dog to chase you and follow you is a great way to encourage them to voluntarily come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3fTUbcJ1YY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=126&pp=iAQB&t=40.9s	40.9	 Overwhelming consistency is important. And what do I mean by that?
