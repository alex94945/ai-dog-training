https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 We've got to get serious about our training today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=2.6s	2.6	 This jumping and biting is one of the main reasons that Moira's had a difficult time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=6.5s	6.5	 getting adopted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 These habits must go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=9.4s	9.4	 This is Moira and I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=11.1s	11.1	 Moira, the German Shepherd dog, is looking for a home and I've only got two weeks to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=15.2s	15.2	 teach her how to behave so that someone will be willing to adopt her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=18.6s	18.6	 Okay, we have a situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 And as you can see, it's not going to be easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=23.1s	23.1	 She jumps excessively, lunges at almost any distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=27.8s	27.8	 Moira loves to bark and she definitely pulls on leash and uses her teeth to interact with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=33.2s	33.2	 the world a little too inappropriately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=35.7s	35.7	 I am feeling a little bit overwhelmed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 If that was a dog, she would be like, I'm not paying attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=40.5s	40.5	 I'm paying attention to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=43.2s	43.2	 I will train this dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 Look at this loose leash right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=47.9s	47.9	 Shake!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=48.9s	48.9	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=49.9s	49.9	 Much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=50.9s	50.9	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=51.9s	51.9	 Is she getting trained?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=53.5s	53.5	 This is reality dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=57.3s	57.3	 As promised, we've got to make up some serious ground here because we are eight days into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=61.3s	61.3	 our two week training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=62.7s	62.7	 Do you know we could not find a full bag of Pup4Treats anywhere in my house?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=67.5s	67.5	 Which is crazy because we get them for free and I get them shipped to me all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=71.2s	71.2	 Pup4Treats do not go unused in my house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=73.9s	73.9	 Look at the sweet potato treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=75.3s	75.3	 I like using them to get a dog to go into a crate voluntarily so I'll take a small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=78.8s	78.8	 handful and just toss them in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 To mix things up, throwing in freeze dried salmon sometimes can be really effective in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 my training because these are just straight up freeze dried meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=86.6s	86.6	 When you're serious about training, you want to have those high value currencies on standby
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=90.4s	90.4	 everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=91.4s	91.4	 If you decide to check out Pup4Treats, use my link.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 I'll have it below in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 I just love this dog and how awesome her personality is, but holy cow, this biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=99.8s	99.8	 We really need to get this play biting under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=101.9s	101.9	 I mean, seriously, this is a huge problem with adult rescue dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 It's leftover puppy biting, but since they didn't have a traditional family to raise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 them during those first few months of life, they have to understand that they can't interact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 with the world with their mouth in the way that they might want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Like we've established before, dogs use their mouth like this because that's how they grab
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=119.1s	119.1	 things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=120.1s	120.1	 I mean, they don't have hands like we do, so we have to show them how to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 Stopping play biting 101 is about redirecting your dog's attention onto a treat or a toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 as we've done many times in the past, but there's more to stopping play biting than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=132.5s	132.5	 just that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 So today, rather than focusing on redirection constantly, I want to kind of teach her a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=139.1s	139.1	 little bit about bite inhibition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=141.1s	141.1	 She does love being pet, but as we just saw, you can't pet her without her going a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=146.5s	146.5	 crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 So that is the thing that I really want to address, her pursuing a human hand with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=151.8s	151.8	 mouth open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=153.1s	153.1	 With adult play biting, sometimes it can take a little bit longer because it's more habitualized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 They've been doing it for a longer period of time, so it can take a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=161.1s	161.1	 Be patient with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 I'm also hoping to desensitize her to the human touch so that she doesn't feel the need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=166.3s	166.3	 to just say, hey, let go of me every time I grab her harness or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=173.2s	173.2	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=174.2s	174.2	 And granted, you shouldn't rush up to a dog to do that, but doesn't mean it won't happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=178.8s	178.8	 from time to time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 And teeth on human flesh from a dog that looks like this can very easily get misinterpreted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=185.4s	185.4	 by a lot of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=186.7s	186.7	 So gonna break out the chicken here, number one, just to get her in food mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 When dogs are in food mode, they're a little less bitey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 They tend to be a little more licky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=196.4s	196.4	 So I'm going to use some treats here and look how good her behavior becomes when these treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=200.8s	200.8	 drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=201.8s	201.8	 That's really a good start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=202.8s	202.8	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=203.8s	203.8	 Now, we're not going to have to use treats all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 This is just to motivate her in the short term to understand what we're looking for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=210.2s	210.2	 here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=211.2s	211.2	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=212.2s	212.2	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=214.2s	214.2	 Hey, that lie down is looking great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=215.6s	215.6	 That's something she didn't do when she first came here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=217.9s	217.9	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 So I'm going to...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=220.9s	220.9	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=221.9s	221.9	 I want to be able to touch her right here under her chin without her being chompy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=225.2s	225.2	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 That's a good start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=227.2s	227.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 I love the lick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=230.2s	230.2	 That's what I'm looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=231.2s	231.2	 Like, any time she's licking where she was otherwise biting, I'm going to reinforce that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=235.3s	235.3	 Say a three-year-old comes up to her head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 Uh-uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=238.6s	238.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=239.6s	239.6	 I like the licking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 That's what I want to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=241.6s	241.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=242.6s	242.6	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 And dogs don't like being pet in the way that I'm doing here, but she still needs to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 very tolerant of that no matter what.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=249.4s	249.4	 So I'm just trying to get her comfortable and short bursts of aggressive human touching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 Because that really is what gets her going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=256.7s	256.7	 When you start roughhousing with her or petting her vigorously, she can get real bitey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 Just giving her very small treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=266.2s	266.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=267.3s	267.3	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=268.3s	268.3	 What happens if I grab her foot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=271.1s	271.1	 Yeah, I'd rather you give me your foot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=273.3s	273.3	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=274.3s	274.3	 She knows shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=275.3s	275.3	 We taught her that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=276.3s	276.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=277.3s	277.3	 Do you see the licking?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 She's starting to get the picture, but it's hard for her to resist the biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=281.4s	281.4	 Let me see if I can get her on her back for a belly rub.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=286.8s	286.8	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=288.8s	288.8	 See, look at all this licking that's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=292.7s	292.7	 There's still a little bit of biting there, but it's starting to shift towards licking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 And I've got her on her back here because I've noticed this is when she tends to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=298.8s	298.8	 the most playful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=299.8s	299.8	 Let me touch these feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=301.4s	301.4	 This is actually quite relevant right now because I'm going to be trimming her nails,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=306.2s	306.2	 hopefully successfully, in a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=308.6s	308.6	 That's why I wanted to do this exercise first so she doesn't become bitey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=311.6s	311.6	 But look how I'm able to touch her feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=313.7s	313.7	 Right now I'm kind of distracting her with the treats just to make sure she's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=318.3s	318.3	 But now let's do it separately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=319.3s	319.3	 Yep, that was a lick as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=322.1s	322.1	 She addressed my hand, but she didn't put teeth on my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=324.9s	324.9	 That's really what I'm going for here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=326.6s	326.6	 Yes, I love the licking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=329.4s	329.4	 And so this is just kind of an example how a very quick training session might look when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=333.6s	333.6	 you're trying to address the biting in those first few weeks of having a dog, whether they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=337.4s	337.4	 an adult or a puppy or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=339.2s	339.2	 This doesn't get resolved in one training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=341.0s	341.0	 This is something I'm going to do with her over the next week and hopefully we'll cut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=343.7s	343.7	 way back on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=344.7s	344.7	 And of course, as a reminder, it's okay for your dog to bite with permission too, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=349.7s	349.7	 So she loves playing with plush toys like this and that gives her satisfaction of biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=355.3s	355.3	 So it's okay for dogs to bite only with permission and in certain ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=359.7s	359.7	 You see what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=360.7s	360.7	 Let's just do a quick check in on her let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=362.3s	362.3	 I'm so proud of her let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=364.2s	364.2	 Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=369.2s	369.2	 Yes, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=371.2s	371.2	 So super proud of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=372.9s	372.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=373.9s	373.9	 Teaching Moira how to conduct herself with her teeth is super important, but also important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=378.0s	378.0	 is her impulse control, especially with a dog with some serious play drive like Moira.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=383.8s	383.8	 I want to continue to surprise her with artificial distractions regularly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 I'm also trying to keep her pretty sharp with her surprise stays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=392.1s	392.1	 That is stay on short notice when she's really excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=395.4s	395.4	 Okay, you can do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=397.2s	397.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=398.2s	398.2	 Sometimes she's a little confused on okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=399.4s	399.4	 Oh wow, I even landed in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=401.4s	401.4	 Love that she went in the crate to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=403.2s	403.2	 This is the kind of thing you just do all the time with a dog in many different ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=407.6s	407.6	 Stay and then okay, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=411.9s	411.9	 Getting her to come to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=412.9s	412.9	 I'm gonna give her a treat for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=415.0s	415.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 At some point in the future, I'm hoping to make her recall a little more advanced by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 having her come right past something that she's distracted by to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=424.1s	424.1	 But if there's something that she likes and it's between me and her, she's very likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=427.8s	427.8	 to choose the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=429.5s	429.5	 Yesterday, I worked on calling her away from a distraction, which also has its whole host
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=433.3s	433.3	 of benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=434.3s	434.3	 But I still want her to come to me even if she's got to pass something that's an inch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=436.9s	436.9	 away from her between her and me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=439.7s	439.7	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=442.7s	442.7	 Okay, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=443.7s	443.7	 Not quite see it's hard for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=446.5s	446.5	 She's like, I'm gonna pick up this thing that I like on the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=449.0s	449.0	 We don't want that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=450.9s	450.9	 That's a distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=451.9s	451.9	 Let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=452.9s	452.9	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=453.9s	453.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=455.0s	455.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=462.0s	462.0	 Okay, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=463.0s	463.0	 Yes, trying to lean her away from the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=466.0s	466.0	 The problem seems to be when it's like directly in her path.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=468.7s	468.7	 If I have it slightly off to the side, it's a little bit easier for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 But I want a cat to be able to run right in between us and her come to me instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=476.5s	476.5	 Okay, clearly we're far away from that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=479.8s	479.8	 Okay, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=483.3s	483.3	 I appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=484.7s	484.7	 I'm like, I'll just go get another one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=485.8s	485.8	 So this is a nice distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=487.3s	487.3	 I like this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=488.3s	488.3	 She's into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=489.3s	489.3	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=490.3s	490.3	 Moira is even more intense about this toy, which means she wants it even more than the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=493.9s	493.9	 last one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=494.9s	494.9	 And it would be really nice to be able to call her attention off something like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=498.4s	498.4	 that she's really excited about as we continue to work up to getting her attention off of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=502.9s	502.9	 dogs in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=504.3s	504.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=505.3s	505.3	 So basically, we're trying to get her to come to me while drawing on that leave it experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 she's had in the past in a few different contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=511.5s	511.5	 Okay, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=512.5s	512.5	 Ah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=513.6s	513.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=517.6s	517.6	 Okay, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=519.5s	519.5	 You can see this is extremely hard for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=521.8s	521.8	 We're having a tough time right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=523.1s	523.1	 I thought I'd be able to get through to her on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=525.3s	525.3	 Let me make it a little bit easier for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=527.3s	527.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=531.3s	531.3	 Uh-uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=532.3s	532.3	 Here, like she's into that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=534.9s	534.9	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=535.9s	535.9	 Okay, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=536.9s	536.9	 I'm going to do it a real short range right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=539.9s	539.9	 All right, so by getting a little bit closer to her, she's more likely to listen to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=544.0s	544.0	 That supports the hypothesis of the small training bubble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=547.1s	547.1	 So that is the closer you are to your dog, the more likely they are to listen to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=550.3s	550.3	 at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=551.3s	551.3	 Let's give this a shot again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=552.8s	552.8	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=553.8s	553.8	 Okay, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=554.8s	554.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=555.8s	555.8	 Much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=556.8s	556.8	 That's so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=558.8s	558.8	 It seems when I really break it down for her and I make it extra easy, she's much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=562.6s	562.6	 likely to listen to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=563.6s	563.6	 Let me see if I can get a couple of successes here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=565.9s	565.9	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=566.9s	566.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=570.1s	570.1	 Okay, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=571.1s	571.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=572.1s	572.1	 Just using different body language there, very obviously showing her that I wanted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=577.1s	577.1	 come in this direction, slightly away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=579.7s	579.7	 I mean, it makes a difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=581.9s	581.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=585.7s	585.7	 Okay, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=586.7s	586.7	 Much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=587.7s	587.7	 All right, so we've got some work to do there, but she's starting to do better with coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=593.7s	593.7	 to me when there's a distraction between us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=596.4s	596.4	 I want to set expectations and make it clear that teaching your dog to come and stay with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=600.5s	600.5	 heavy distractions in a variety of contexts is something you focus on for the first two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=604.7s	604.7	 years you have them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=606.0s	606.0	 The idea is that you get 80% there in pretty short order, and then it's that last 20% where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=611.5s	611.5	 they're thrown wild cards in various situations that you have to really make sure they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=615.4s	615.4	 prepared for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=616.4s	616.4	 And we do that by having them on lead, controlling their environment, making sure they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=620.4s	620.4	 in a position to get away from us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=622.3s	622.3	 That's why we're always practicing in different settings and situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=625.5s	625.5	 It's time to give Moira a quick break, so I want to give you guys a quick update on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=628.2s	628.2	 how Moira has been doing when I leave her alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=630.5s	630.5	 You'll remember that we've been working on Moira's separation anxiety, and so far that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=634.1s	634.1	 anxiety seems to be limited to crate anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=637.8s	637.8	 So I've been leaving her alone in a larger enclosed area that has an open crate in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=642.9s	642.9	 That seems to be helping her stress levels remain low while also desensitizing her to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=647.6s	647.6	 being alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=648.6s	648.6	 Let me show you what I do that's been making the process a little bit easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=652.1s	652.1	 I've got some kibble here, and so I'll just pour like a quarter cup, kind of just on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=658.2s	658.2	 floor there, just to get her focused on being comfortable in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=662.1s	662.1	 She's come to look forward to this part of the day, so she's pretty preoccupied there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=670.7s	670.7	 Then I'll keep an eye on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=671.9s	671.9	 I've got a couple of cameras in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=673.7s	673.7	 We'll see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=675.8s	675.8	 This might be one of my favorite devices on earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=677.9s	677.9	 If you're looking for an excellent dog camera that also allows you to give your dog treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=682.6s	682.6	 then you need a Furbo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=684.0s	684.0	 It's super advanced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=685.0s	685.0	 It has tons of smart alerts, like barking alerts and even safety alerts, so it keeps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=688.8s	688.8	 you updated on how your dog is doing even when you're not actively looking at them on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=692.9s	692.9	 your phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=693.9s	693.9	 I'll have a link in the description where you can check out Furbo dog camera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=696.6s	696.6	 By the way, Pupford treats fit perfectly in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=700.1s	700.1	 Moira jumped on me this morning, and I was noticing how long her nails were.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=704.4s	704.4	 We're going to talk more about jumping later, but getting your dog comfortable with basic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=708.2s	708.2	 things like a nail dremel can be very important if this is how you choose to maintain their nails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=712.9s	712.9	 There's a motorized sound in here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=714.1s	714.1	 It can be a little ticklish or off-putting to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=716.9s	716.9	 So I'm hoping to introduce her to this right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=719.7s	719.7	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=720.7s	720.7	 See, I'm just letting her smell it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=721.7s	721.7	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=722.7s	722.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=723.7s	723.7	 So I'm going to show it to her, give her some chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=727.8s	727.8	 So far she obviously likes it maybe a little too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=729.9s	729.9	 I'm going to turn it on real quick, just for a sec.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=732.5s	732.5	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=734.4s	734.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=735.4s	735.4	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=736.4s	736.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=737.4s	737.4	 A lot of dogs get really frightened over that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=744.1s	744.1	 Moira so far is very intrigued by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=746.4s	746.4	 Why am I not surprised?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=747.4s	747.4	 Come here, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=748.4s	748.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=749.4s	749.4	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=750.4s	750.4	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=751.4s	751.4	 Uh-uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=752.4s	752.4	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=753.4s	753.4	 Nope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=754.4s	754.4	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=755.4s	755.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=756.4s	756.4	 With her, it seems pretty effective to have some treats right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=760.4s	760.4	 Easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=761.4s	761.4	 I like that she's licking, not biting too hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=764.4s	764.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=765.4s	765.4	 So here I can have it on high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=767.7s	767.7	 She's still interested in the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=769.1s	769.1	 Whoa, easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=770.1s	770.1	 You remember, lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=771.1s	771.1	 Let me see if I can put her into a more stable position here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=775.4s	775.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=777.4s	777.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=778.4s	778.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=779.4s	779.4	 I like that she's not scared by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=783.2s	783.2	 Remember, shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=787.4s	787.4	 Shake.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=792.4s	792.4	 See here, now I'm going to touch it to her nail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=794.4s	794.4	 Leave it alone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=798.4s	798.4	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=799.4s	799.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=800.4s	800.4	 Uh-uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=801.4s	801.4	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=802.4s	802.4	 All right, I need to take a step back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=804.4s	804.4	 We have to work on leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=806.4s	806.4	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=807.4s	807.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=810.4s	810.4	 Here, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=811.4s	811.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=813.4s	813.4	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=814.4s	814.4	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=815.4s	815.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=818.4s	818.4	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=820.4s	820.4	 Here, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=822.4s	822.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=824.4s	824.4	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=825.4s	825.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=826.4s	826.4	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=827.4s	827.4	 I'm just connecting the dots here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=829.4s	829.4	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=830.4s	830.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=833.4s	833.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=834.4s	834.4	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=836.4s	836.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=837.4s	837.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=839.4s	839.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=840.4s	840.4	 Uh-oh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=841.4s	841.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=842.4s	842.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=843.4s	843.4	 She did not like that at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=844.4s	844.4	 So I'm going to stop right there because I think we're going to make it worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=847.4s	847.4	 I barely touched her with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=848.4s	848.4	 I thought she was at that point because she was leaving it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=850.4s	850.4	 She was behaving acceptably while it was off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=853.4s	853.4	 I mean, who knows what her background is on this, but clearly she has a ways to go on the Dremel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=858.4s	858.4	 So I'm going to hold off on that for now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=860.4s	860.4	 And these are the critical moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=861.4s	861.4	 I mean, when you see that your dog has gone too far with something, give them a break, take a step back and reevaluate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=867.4s	867.4	 So that's what I'll be doing with the Dremel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=868.4s	868.4	 What I don't want to do is force my way through and neither should you because you don't want to make an issue that's potentially bad even worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=875.4s	875.4	 So I'm going to introduce her to these instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=878.4s	878.4	 Some more traditional nail clippers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=880.4s	880.4	 Come here, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=881.4s	881.4	 We'll see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=882.4s	882.4	 Hopefully this will go a little more smooth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=884.4s	884.4	 See this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=885.4s	885.4	 You want to smell these?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=886.4s	886.4	 She's like, whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=889.4s	889.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=890.4s	890.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=891.4s	891.4	 Touching her nails here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=893.4s	893.4	 There's some letting her nibble on the chicken a little bit here too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=896.4s	896.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=897.4s	897.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=900.4s	900.4	 Shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=902.4s	902.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=903.4s	903.4	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=904.4s	904.4	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=905.4s	905.4	 Her foot's a little bit sensitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=906.4s	906.4	 Let me try something else to make this even lower stress for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=910.4s	910.4	 We have this mat here from Pupford, which is really great for things like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=914.4s	914.4	 I'm hoping this might help us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=915.4s	915.4	 There's some peanut butter spread out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=917.4s	917.4	 You see all these grooves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=918.4s	918.4	 So it makes it last a longer time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=920.4s	920.4	 So hopefully this will get her a little more at ease with having her nails trimmed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=924.4s	924.4	 So far, she's doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=926.4s	926.4	 And since she is so focused on this peanut butter, I think I'm just going to take my chances and dive into it here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=932.4s	932.4	 So here we're counter conditioning her, like getting her to be more tolerant of something that she typically isn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=937.4s	937.4	 And she's getting a good experience of eating that peanut butter at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=941.4s	941.4	 And she's like, hey, I don't mind this so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=943.4s	943.4	 So we'll cater our approach to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=945.4s	945.4	 You're doing so great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=946.4s	946.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=950.4s	950.4	 Her back ones look pretty short, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=952.4s	952.4	 So I think we're OK there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=953.4s	953.4	 But really good first nail trimming experience for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=957.4s	957.4	 Some dogs are going to be more comfortable with certain approaches versus others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=960.4s	960.4	 I mean, that's a lesson we've learned here, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=962.4s	962.4	 The Dremel, too overwhelming for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=964.4s	964.4	 But the traditional nail clippers, she was fine with those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=967.4s	967.4	 So we'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=968.4s	968.4	 Good job, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=969.4s	969.4	 I'll have a link to the Pupford Lick Mats in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=972.4s	972.4	 We got a dog right out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=973.4s	973.4	 OK, we got to jump into a secondary training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=975.4s	975.4	 She's dog reactive, but I'm in a golden opportunity here to make some progress on this because I'm inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=980.4s	980.4	 The dog is outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=981.4s	981.4	 She's likely not going to be as stimulated as if we were on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=985.4s	985.4	 So it's kind of an in-between session where I might be able to get a victory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=988.4s	988.4	 Let me see if I can get her to come to me when I call her while that dog is out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=991.4s	991.4	 That would be huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=993.4s	993.4	 Moira, here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=994.4s	994.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=995.4s	995.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=996.4s	996.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=997.4s	997.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=998.4s	998.4	 OK, you want to go look?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=999.4s	999.4	 Let's look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1000.4s	1000.4	 I don't want her totally repressing her desire to check out the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1004.4s	1004.4	 OK, Moira, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1005.4s	1005.4	 Yeah, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1007.4s	1007.4	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1008.4s	1008.4	 OK, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1009.4s	1009.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1010.4s	1010.4	 Moira, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1013.4s	1013.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1014.4s	1014.4	 That's a good example of a secondary training session where you just have to snap into training mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1019.4s	1019.4	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1020.4s	1020.4	 And really address the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1022.4s	1022.4	 So right there, I saw it was a great opportunity to practice a strong recall in the presence of a dog, albeit a lot easier for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1029.4s	1029.4	 See, we're in here right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1031.4s	1031.4	 If we were outside inches away from the dog, it wouldn't have been as easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1035.4s	1035.4	 But you have to get it right here before you can get it right out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1038.4s	1038.4	 This is a good example of being consistent, and you want to do this wherever possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1043.4s	1043.4	 And just as a reminder, we don't want to rely on training sessions like this to completely train our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1048.4s	1048.4	 These are just supplementary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1049.4s	1049.4	 We still have to go out of our way to do training sessions in the presence of dogs in the distance, much like we did just yesterday with Moira.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1056.4s	1056.4	 But that's very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1057.4s	1057.4	 She is getting smarter exponentially by the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1061.4s	1061.4	 As far as her jumping goes, that's something we really want to get under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1065.4s	1065.4	 She's doing really well with me because we've been working together a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1068.4s	1068.4	 And right now, she's pretty into the training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1070.4s	1070.4	 But you saw just a moment ago, she was really excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1072.4s	1072.4	 Right now, I'm giving her a treat to really reinforce the calm behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1075.4s	1075.4	 So I like that a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1077.4s	1077.4	 I mean, if you think about it, at its simplest, teaching a dog not to jump on you is just getting them to sit and stay when they're excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1084.4s	1084.4	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1085.4s	1085.4	 I've done a number of those drills with her throughout this last week or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1089.4s	1089.4	 But when she sees someone new, it's a little bit more tempting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1093.4s	1093.4	 And you might remember that Brianna's mom was over here pretty recently and Moira was just a little too out of control for my liking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1100.4s	1100.4	 She's coming over in a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1102.4s	1102.4	 I'm hoping we can use her as a real life training distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1105.4s	1105.4	 This is something that most of you can do as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1107.4s	1107.4	 If you've got a friend of the family or a relative or anyone who can come over to help you with teaching your dog not to jump on other people, that's always nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1116.4s	1116.4	 I'm hoping to make some progress with her on that, teaching her how to sit and stay when genuinely excited by someone other than me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1124.4s	1124.4	 I have two main tips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1125.4s	1125.4	 Number one, exercise your dog literally just before they come over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1129.4s	1129.4	 You want your dog tired and preferably panting as your guest walks up to the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1134.4s	1134.4	 So they've had some recent fulfillment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1136.4s	1136.4	 Secondly, have your dog restrained or on leash so that you can easily manage them if they are a little too out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1143.4s	1143.4	 So I'll be doing that with her as well as we go through this jumping lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1147.4s	1147.4	 The goal is going to be to have Bri's mom, my mother-in-law, pet her without getting jumped on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1154.4s	1154.4	 You think you can do this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1156.4s	1156.4	 Not really sure how this is going to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1158.4s	1158.4	 I don't know if this is a good idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1160.4s	1160.4	 Moira, please be nice to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1162.4s	1162.4	 I really need her to like me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1164.4s	1164.4	 Okay, there's chicken in it for you if you do well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1166.4s	1166.4	 Okay, come on in, Deb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1168.4s	1168.4	 Oh, this is going to be crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1169.4s	1169.4	 You want to go say hi?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1170.4s	1170.4	 Let's go say hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1171.4s	1171.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1172.4s	1172.4	 Okay, so right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1173.4s	1173.4	 That's why we have them on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1174.4s	1174.4	 And see, is Deb a pro or what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1176.4s	1176.4	 She knows exactly what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1178.4s	1178.4	 It's as though we've known each other for almost a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1181.4s	1181.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1182.4s	1182.4	 Back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1183.4s	1183.4	 So I'm going to actually back off a little with her and you can step back maybe just a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1187.4s	1187.4	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1188.4s	1188.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1189.4s	1189.4	 But you can see her desire here is to immediately jump and greet her at the face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1194.4s	1194.4	 You're a big scary German shepherd, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1196.4s	1196.4	 You can't do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1197.4s	1197.4	 The bottom line here is that they are going to get the attention they want as long as they keep all four of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1201.4s	1201.4	 As long as they keep all four paws on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1203.4s	1203.4	 And if they jump, then whatever it is they want, whether it's treats, the other person, a toy or anything, that goes away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1211.4s	1211.4	 That's how we provide an unpleasant consequence to undesired behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1215.4s	1215.4	 But we don't have to be overly harsh about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1217.4s	1217.4	 That's usually good enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1218.4s	1218.4	 All right, so why don't you try and come in slowly to pet her under the chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1222.4s	1222.4	 And if she looks like she's about to jump, just back off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1225.4s	1225.4	 Yes, I'm going to just go ahead and reward her because she's not jumping yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1229.4s	1229.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1230.4s	1230.4	 Good. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1231.4s	1231.4	 Good. I'm trying to prevent the jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1233.4s	1233.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1235.4s	1235.4	 From happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1236.4s	1236.4	 And this is really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1237.4s	1237.4	 Look, loose leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1238.4s	1238.4	 Let's quit while we're ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1239.4s	1239.4	 I'm going to have you back away now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1240.4s	1240.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1241.4s	1241.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1243.4s	1243.4	 Even got it down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1244.4s	1244.4	 But you can see how delicate that stay is in that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1248.4s	1248.4	 I'm having to keep that treat right in her face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1251.4s	1251.4	 But let's see if we can improve that a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1253.4s	1253.4	 Having fun so far?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1254.4s	1254.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1255.4s	1255.4	 Doing a great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1256.4s	1256.4	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1257.4s	1257.4	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1258.4s	1258.4	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1259.4s	1259.4	 If you want to say hi, please say hi gently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1262.4s	1262.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1264.4s	1264.4	 And Moira.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1265.4s	1265.4	 OK, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1266.4s	1266.4	 All right, that's what I'm going to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1268.4s	1268.4	 This time before she starts jumping, I'm going to call her away so she has some experience of being called away from something exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1275.4s	1275.4	 Say hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1276.4s	1276.4	 Hey, little dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1277.4s	1277.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1278.4s	1278.4	 OK, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1279.4s	1279.4	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1280.4s	1280.4	 So we're interrupting the behavior before it occurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1282.4s	1282.4	 When you have company coming over, if you don't feel like going through all this, have your dog in another room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1287.4s	1287.4	 and then bring your dog out once everyone is settled and say, look, I need like five minutes to train my dog and see if you can get someone to help you out like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1293.4s	1293.4	 But if your attention is divided, then you can't really hope to train a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1298.4s	1298.4	 Even better. I'll take this behavior all day long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1300.4s	1300.4	 So here she is flopping on her back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1302.4s	1302.4	 Hey, sweetie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1303.4s	1303.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1304.4s	1304.4	 If you have a willing guest who's willing to help you, then they might be able to achieve some results as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1309.4s	1309.4	 But I want to make sure that you know how to deal with this, because ultimately it's your responsibility, your dog, to keep them in a sit-stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1316.4s	1316.4	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1317.4s	1317.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1319.4s	1319.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1321.4s	1321.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1323.4s	1323.4	 So there I was able to reward a little less frequently than the first time where I had to be constantly there, but still pretty rapid just to get the point across.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1332.4s	1332.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1333.4s	1333.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1334.4s	1334.4	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1337.4s	1337.4	 Don't jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1338.4s	1338.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1339.4s	1339.4	 That's very nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1341.4s	1341.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1342.4s	1342.4	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1343.4s	1343.4	 You've been a good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1344.4s	1344.4	 You've been such a good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1346.4s	1346.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1347.4s	1347.4	 You can see it in her eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1348.4s	1348.4	 She's like, I want to jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1350.4s	1350.4	 But I really also want that treat right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1353.4s	1353.4	 If you've got an exuberant jumper, this is exactly why you want to have them on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1357.4s	1357.4	 I know it's weird having your dog on leash inside the house, but it's even weirder to have your dog tackling your guests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1363.4s	1363.4	 What you'll find with most dogs is they will eventually settle down after just 10, 20 minutes tops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1369.4s	1369.4	 So if you can just kind of be on them and teach them for that first few minutes, there's a very good likelihood that they're going to chill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1374.4s	1374.4	 It's just that real initial greeting when most dogs meet other people where they just lose their mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1379.4s	1379.4	 So try to avoid having your dog up in a room too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1382.4s	1382.4	 Give them the opportunity to experience being around people where possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1387.4s	1387.4	 If they tend to be excessive jumpers, I've got her in a real stable down stay here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1392.4s	1392.4	 Let's see how stable it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1394.4s	1394.4	 I'm giving her little treats here just to encourage the duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1398.4s	1398.4	 Again, by being low to the ground, we're discouraging jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1402.4s	1402.4	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1405.4s	1405.4	 So look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1406.4s	1406.4	 And this is great, but I'd still like Moira to be able to sit politely while being greeted while Deb stands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1413.4s	1413.4	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1416.4s	1416.4	 And so very good. I'd say a lot of progress here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1418.4s	1418.4	 Nice job, Moira.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1419.4s	1419.4	 Good girl. That's how we greet people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1422.4s	1422.4	 That's how we interact with them by not jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1425.4s	1425.4	 You're such a good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1426.4s	1426.4	 Stay a little more exuberantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1431.4s	1431.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1432.4s	1432.4	 Oh, I love you, baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1434.4s	1434.4	 You're such a sweetie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1435.4s	1435.4	 Moira's not only sitting politely, but she's also not play biting either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1439.4s	1439.4	 And those are two things she definitely would have been doing just a few hours ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1443.4s	1443.4	 Okay, come on. I'm going to quit while we're ahead there to make sure we end on that successful moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1447.4s	1447.4	 Because training dogs is all about getting those minor moments at first and then building on those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1453.4s	1453.4	 This is her first formal training session on not jumping on other people outside of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1459.4s	1459.4	 So I think she did pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1461.4s	1461.4	 We'll continue working on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1462.4s	1462.4	 Clearly, this isn't something that happens in one training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1465.4s	1465.4	 But this is what you do over and over and over until your dog starts to realize, oh, okay, I guess these are the rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1471.4s	1471.4	 Thumbs up for Deb.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1487.4s	1487.4	 Oh my gosh, is it actually time for episode eight?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1490.4s	1490.4	 We still have so much to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhNaHNJpUrs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=1492.4s	1492.4	 I gotta go.
