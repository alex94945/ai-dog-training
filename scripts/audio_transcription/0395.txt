https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSmFWdO72sM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=396&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 Being a vet tech and being in the veterinary industry, I know that the more mentally

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSmFWdO72sM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=396&pp=iAQB&t=166.5s	166.5	 I went and checked it out. Holmes is by himself for the first time ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSmFWdO72sM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=396&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 He was getting into a box that he wasn't supposed to be getting into.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSmFWdO72sM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=396&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 He was kind of confused. He didn't know where we were coming from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSmFWdO72sM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=396&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 But it got him to stop and then I threw him some treats and now he's just laying down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSmFWdO72sM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=396&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 I'm really enjoying being able to see that he's okay.
