https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=37.2s	37.2	 There's tons of methods and gimmicks out there designed to try to convince your dog to take a pill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 But the most effective way is actually the most simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 Put the pill inside one of these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 People try all kinds of different foods for hiding pills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 Maybe it's cheese or peanut butter or even real meat, and they never really work as well as you think they will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 These Greenies Pill Pockets are by far the easiest and most convincing for dogs that really don't like taking their pills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 They come molded with this little pouch that makes it easy to stick a pill, capsule, or even liquid medicine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=66.3s	66.3	 And they're extra moldable so they don't crumble when you're trying to fully disguise the medicine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 They've got a pretty strong smell to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=72.3s	72.3	 That helps disguise the smell of the medicine for those extra skeptical dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=76.2s	76.2	 They come in different sizes so you can fit practically any size pill inside these.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 My friend Angie is Sunny's mom and she's gonna join me today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=89.2s	89.2	 Now Angie, I know you've taught Sunny lots of cool stuff and I just love how cute she looks when she speaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 She loves to speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 Sunny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=95.7s	95.7	 Woof!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=97.4s	97.4	 Sunny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=97.8s	97.8	 Ooh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=98.1s	98.1	 Woof!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 Can I try and get her to talk like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=99.8s	99.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=100.6s	100.6	 Alright, Sunny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 Wooo, woof, woof, woof.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 Is that not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=104.8s	104.8	 Say, ooh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 Woof!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 Okay, alright, got this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=109.2s	109.2	 Sunny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 Ooh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=111.7s	111.7	 Woof!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=112.9s	112.9	 Speak can come in handy for a lot of different things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=115.2s	115.2	 In fact, we had Sunny speak in my recent video where we were teaching Biscuit, the Bernese Mountain Dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=119.7s	119.7	 to walk on leash around distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 It's like a barking golden retriever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=123.7s	123.7	 Do you want to see Sunny crawl too?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 She looks pretty cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=126.3s	126.3	 I can't resist that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 It looks like you're signaling her with your feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 Oh, that's cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=129.9s	129.9	 Yes, I am.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=130.5s	130.5	 Oh, I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 Now that's original.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=133.1s	133.1	 And she goes so purposeful there, just an inch at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 So she waits for each individual crawl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=138.1s	138.1	 Why don't you give us a quick overview as to how you taught that to Sunny?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 We started with a treat lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 I just kind of just dragged it on the ground a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=145.6s	145.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 So as long as she moved, you know, one paw or eventually two paws, three paws,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=151.1s	151.1	 and then she would get her treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 And then just over the years, you know, as she did it more and more,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 I kind of transitioned it to more of a foot cube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 Do you want to see Sunny spin today too?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 I can't think of anything I'd rather see than Sunny spinning right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 Nice, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=165.8s	165.8	 And that's how you know your communication is super solid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=168.4s	168.4	 when you can be that nonchalant and that subtle with your cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 How did you evolve your signal to be so subtle over time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=174.8s	174.8	 Well, this was actually a pretty recent trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=176.8s	176.8	 But as you can tell, she loves following food lures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 First, I just had her make a wide circle and just follow the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=184.7s	184.7	 And then as we practice more and more, I would kind of tighten the circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 a little bit more, or I would not have a treat in my hand all the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=193.5s	193.5	 and then just kind of get that motion smaller and smaller.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=196.6s	196.6	 That just goes to show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=197.4s	197.4	 I mean, not every trick is just going to happen in one fell swoop like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=201.9s	201.9	 I could probably do this next trick with the even more subtle cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=204.4s	204.4	 Let's see if you can spot it, Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=205.6s	205.6	 OK, I'll do my best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=209.2s	209.2	 Oh, nice. That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=211.1s	211.1	 How do you tell her to lie down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=212.4s	212.4	 You can see how that's different, but still very similar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=215.7s	215.7	 It's just a testament to how smart dogs are that they can differentiate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 between those subtle differences and the way we communicate with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=222.4s	222.4	 Even though Sunny's 13 years old, I love how you're always teaching her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=225.7s	225.7	 something new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=226.6s	226.6	 Do you think we could see a few more tricks that you're working on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=229.2s	229.2	 or in the process of teaching?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=230.6s	230.6	 Yeah, maybe you could help me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=231.7s	231.7	 So we're working on bow, which she could kind of do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 but sometimes her butt goes down too fast, but she doesn't sustain the bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 Oh, I see what you're saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 And then her butt goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=241.9s	241.9	 So she's holding it for a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 So it looks like we just need to communicate to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=245.2s	245.2	 Yes, that's bow when she's still holding it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=247.2s	247.2	 This time, I'll give her some support under her belly right here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=250.1s	250.1	 just to kind of discourage her from going into a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=252.4s	252.4	 And you focus on luring her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=253.5s	253.5	 OK, take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=256.7s	256.7	 You go and then give her a yes or yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=259.2s	259.2	 Good girl. Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=260.5s	260.5	 And then release her from it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=261.7s	261.7	 OK, good job. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=263.6s	263.6	 And I actually didn't have to hold on to her there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=265.3s	265.3	 She was really holding it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=266.6s	266.6	 Maybe we could work on phasing my arm out this time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=269.1s	269.1	 and see if she can hold it for two seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=270.9s	270.9	 That would be awesome. So let's give it another shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=272.8s	272.8	 All right. Take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=276.3s	276.3	 Oh, look at that. That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=277.4s	277.4	 She's holding it right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 I'm going to try and get my arm out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=280.1s	280.1	 Oh, that's what's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 Take a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=283.3s	283.3	 OK, I'm not touching her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=284.3s	284.3	 One. Yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=285.8s	285.8	 And then reward her. Good girl. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=288.2s	288.2	 Exactly. She eventually went down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=289.8s	289.8	 But as long as we're saying, hey, that's a bow while your butt's still up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=292.7s	292.7	 I think most dogs are going to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=294.1s	294.1	 We've also been working on a leg weave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=297.2s	297.2	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=300.7s	300.7	 Nice. Look at her go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=302.7s	302.7	 How long have you been doing this one, Angie? A month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=304.8s	304.8	 Oh, so really new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=306.1s	306.1	 And it can throw some dogs off there when you have to switch up your luring hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=310.5s	310.5	 So she's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=311.6s	311.6	 I think she's going to have this down in no time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 And this next one, Sunny actually just learned last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=316.4s	316.4	 Bang, bang.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=320.6s	320.6	 That's great. I love the bang bang.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=322.2s	322.2	 That's nice. Very convincing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_droCQsWzgg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=474&pp=iAQB&t=323.9s	323.9	 That's pretty good for just last week, girl.
