https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 We started to introduce distance last week with our dogs by walking back and forth with them, just introducing movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 I like introducing stay with movement like this, nice and early with them, because it simulates distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 Very good, very good. We're going to do the same concept, but this time we're going to start to walk away from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 I'm going to show you how to train stay with distance right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 Ask Chauncey to stay, and now it's just a half a step back and one right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 So, yes, now back here, come and reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 In other words, what we're doing here, we're not throwing in duration here, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 We're not asking them to stay with duration. We're trying to introduce distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 So it's stay and then boom, right back, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Get them used to seeing you walk away from them, but they also need to know you're going to be right back in a millisecond.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 Back up and then back here. Yep, and exactly, and we build it over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 And that's exactly how we start introducing distance with stay. That was a great job, guys. Really nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 What you're doing is this. So stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 See what we're doing here? Gradually increasing the distance. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Little bit more this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 And I'm only going that far this early because I know that you guys have achieved really good communications so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 I wouldn't do that normally unless the dog was really solid with stay in this environment, but, you know, testament to your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Now don't just go back a half an inch. Now come back. Quick, quick, quick. Boom. Set them up for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 That's how you build it. And then you gradually just give a little bit more time, but that's how you get that initial spark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 I want you to work on this every day for the next week. Okay. Doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 Now come back. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEIvg_K3Wk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=641&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 But he praises her in such an authentic, genuine way. It's not just simply good girl, you know. It's a very loving, genuine way.
