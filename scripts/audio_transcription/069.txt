https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I'm Zach George. I'm a dog trainer. I use evidence-based positive reinforcement to train dogs prioritizing their emotional well-being.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 This creates a highly effective learning environment and fosters a happy relationship between us and our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=12.9s	12.9	 Today I want to go over first how to train a super easy trick, and then I want to go over how to train a still pretty easy trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=19.7s	19.7	 I want to start with a crowd pleaser like spin. It starts with a lure. It's a way to get them to understand the motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 But the idea is to be able to say spin like that. And as you can see, she doesn't quite understand that concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 I'm going to keep the treat in my hand, but I want to redirect her onto my index finger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 Oh my goodness, did you see the half spin? Yes, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 Every time I say yes right now, I'm going to give her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 Look, and I got two lures there with just the index finger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 Now I'd like to see if I can reduce that hand signal so I'm not having to do this big motion all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=51.6s	51.6	 Did you see that one? You don't always have to use food to train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=54.4s	54.4	 And you can see how that really gets her going on spin. That's a winner of a toy there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 I like how they have the little tug toys in addition to the lobster claws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=61.7s	61.7	 That's one of the reasons I really like Pup Box is because they make that process really easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 Pup Box is going to put things in here that you're not necessarily going to think of that can open all kinds of doors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=70.1s	70.1	 You'll get tips on preventing separation anxiety in the nine month box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 Grooming tips. In this box, you get a high quality shampoo and conditioner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=76.2s	76.2	 You'll learn how to train your dog to stay at doorways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=78.9s	78.9	 The thing about this toy is it doesn't inhibit their breathing when they're bringing it back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 So you have all this ventilation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 You can get 50% off your first box by going to pupbox.com slash Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=87.5s	87.5	 I'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=88.4s	88.4	 Bree and I have been so excited to teach Veronica one of our signature tricks that we like to teach dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=94.4s	94.4	 And that is something we call a back stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=96.6s	96.6	 That's where a dog literally jumps on your back and stays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=100.2s	100.2	 It's remarkably flashy, remarkably easy and insanely fun to teach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=105.2s	105.2	 This is what a proper finished back stall looks like with inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 We could just skip the back stall and do a lap stall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=111.9s	111.9	 Now the first step to teaching a back stall is to get them comfortable with jumping onto something like a fallen redwood tree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 If you don't happen to have a fallen redwood tree, you could use something like a chair or a bench, but make sure your dog can grip it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=123.6s	123.6	 We happen to have some moss that's extra grippy, which I like a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 I'm just trying to get her to maybe put her paws up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=130.5s	130.5	 Just to like ease her into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=132.1s	132.1	 I'm not just going to try to get her to jump up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 She doesn't know what that means yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 Let's see if I can get one or two of these. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=139.3s	139.3	 And I'm just kind of luring her up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=141.7s	141.7	 I could probably just say maybe if I just tap it so I don't have to be too lure dependent here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 Good. So she's getting comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=150.3s	150.3	 Her confidence is increasing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=151.6s	151.6	 So I want to see if I can get her to actually jump up on that log.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 That would be really nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 It's really important to get dogs to do things like this on their own accord.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 For example, we don't just want to put her up on the log and tell her to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 Looks like she's thinking about it, doesn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=163.3s	163.3	 Jumping up is an important part of this trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=165.1s	165.1	 Oh, my gosh. Did you see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 Getting down is a whole different thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=168.9s	168.9	 Look, she's a little cautious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=170.2s	170.2	 OK, come on. There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=172.7s	172.7	 Yes, there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=174.5s	174.5	 Maybe my favorite thing about this trick is that it is an amazing confidence builder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 And it's pretty easy to see how building confidence like this translates into the real world as you move on with training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 But the real point here is to get Veronica to jump on Brianna's back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 This is a trick that you've really been wanting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 Yes, I love this trick. I'm so excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 I'm thinking that rather than just having her jump directly on your back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=197.6s	197.6	 it might make more sense to get her up there so that she can kind of walk onto your back a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 OK, yeah, because my back is a little bit scarier, potentially, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=205.8s	205.8	 Because I'm like not I'm more uneven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=208.2s	208.2	 And so she could be a little bit more nervous about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=210.4s	210.4	 Yeah, exactly. So that's why you're thinking she's more sure of herself here because we taught her this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=215.4s	215.4	 So then maybe that'll help her be more sure of herself on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=217.7s	217.7	 Come on. Good. So she's still comfortable there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=220.8s	220.8	 She hasn't forgotten that. That's nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=222.9s	222.9	 Give me a nice level surface here. You're level. You're perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 Yeah. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=227.8s	227.8	 Doesn't that feel great? So I'm not asking her to put all four feet at one time on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=231.5s	231.5	 How many feet are on there? Two. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 Now she's got three. Now, we really want to be mindful of slips like that because we don't want our dog to become too fearful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=239.8s	239.8	 My goal there is to quickly try to get her back on track and focused on the task at hand here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 Teaching a back stall in the Redwood forest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 That sentence has never been spoken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=251.1s	251.1	 Come on. Good girl. There it is. There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=253.9s	253.9	 So that's the first. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=257.2s	257.2	 OK. All right. Let's let her let's let her get back up here so she doesn't fall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=261.6s	261.6	 Nice work, girl. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 You see, she's getting a little shaky there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 So we want to teach her how to get down confidently because we don't want her experiencing falling off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=271.3s	271.3	 She seems quite at home. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 She's faced the wrong way, but we can work on that later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=276.1s	276.1	 It's more important just to get the muscle memory going here, get her comfortable with stabilizing herself on a human back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=282.6s	282.6	 And also, we want to make sure she knows how to get down. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 I remember you saying this is the trick that like made you feel so excited about dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=291.2s	291.2	 Yeah, back stall can easily be taught in one or two training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=294.5s	294.5	 So it's such a flashy looking trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=296.7s	296.7	 It looks like it would be really advanced and hard to train, but it really isn't in most cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=301.5s	301.5	 Now, some dogs may not love this type of activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=304.0s	304.0	 It's always important to consider that, like not every trick is for every dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=307.1s	307.1	 Well, I think we're ready to get her to actually jump on your back now from the ground, that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=312.1s	312.1	 Like so that you don't have to have a redwood tree with you every time you're doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 Oh, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=318.2s	318.2	 Ideally, Veronica will jump from this side and get up there, not from the side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=322.2s	322.2	 Although, you know, you can make your own rules. However you want to do it, it's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=327.5s	327.5	 I see. And that's normal. A lot of dogs will try and go around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=330.7s	330.7	 So don't worry about that. We'll get one here if we keep trying. I'm pretty sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=334.1s	334.1	 We'll reward her for any effort at all. Remember, we've changed the variable here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=337.9s	337.9	 Yeah, there we go. That's the first one ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=341.4s	341.4	 Come on. She's such a natural. So you can see how it really paid. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 To have her rehearse in that easier way first rather than skipping the step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=351.4s	351.4	 And it is important. Have them get down when you say. So a prerequisite for this is that you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=356.0s	356.0	 taught a stay until you release your dog. So they understand that concept and yet another benefit to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=360.9s	360.9	 the back stall. It's yet another way to teach your dog how to stay and how to hold the position in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=365.4s	365.4	 the specific scenario. And that goes a long way towards teaching them to generalize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=369.9s	369.9	 the very important skill of stay when we ask them to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 The next part of this is duration too. We want her to stay up here for a period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=379.6s	379.6	 until we release her just nice and still. Yes. We've been working on stay and stay anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=384.2s	384.2	 So this is quite convenient. Yes. Good. Okay. Come. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=391.9s	391.9	 Do you want Veronica to try and jump up a little higher?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 I think we'll need to work on Bree's form a little bit in the future, but for now it'll do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=399.5s	399.5	 Bree, this is the life you've chosen. This is my favorite job I've ever done in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=403.5s	403.5	 a Zach George video. I have to say. Good. Like before, I'm still going to reward for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=409.4s	409.4	 effort because she's engaged and she's trying. I love this example right here because I can see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=414.2s	414.2	 it in Veronica's eyes that she's like, I'm going to jump. I think I'm going to do it in a way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=419.1s	419.1	 keeps them upbeat and optimistic. Good. Good. Come on. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 Oh, that's why knowing your individual dog is so important because you can read them and kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=427.1s	427.1	 help them through those moments. Tricks build confidence and as importantly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=430.4s	430.4	 they build communication between you and a dog. Let's lower her down a little. So it's not as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=434.6s	434.6	 daunting. Can you do that? Sometimes people call me a trick trainer. Okay. Understand that whether
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=440.3s	440.3	 it's sit, lie down, come, stay, or roll over or stand on my back, they're all tricks per se. It's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=446.8s	446.8	 semantics. So we're teaching our dogs to do a variety of tasks that really challenge them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=451.4s	451.4	 mentally and really have the effect of making them a much richer thinker. Can one person teach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=455.8s	455.8	 this alone? Yes, certainly one person could teach this alone. You did, right? I remember you saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=461.0s	461.0	 this is the trick that made you feel so excited about dog training. When we travel, we don't always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=465.7s	465.7	 have the luxury to let our dogs off leash. So in this case, we're in California, we're in a national
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=470.2s	470.2	 forest and they're super strict about leash laws, both at the campground and on the trails. So how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=475.0s	475.0	 do we work within those limitations? This is how we try to innovate some semi off leash freedom for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=479.7s	479.7	 the dogs. What's great. I think this is a 30 foot lead. So I have 30 feet that way and 30 feet that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=486.2s	486.2	 way. So if I can affix it to something at the midpoint, then I get 60 feet. But yeah, there's a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=492.2s	492.2	 of benefits here. I mean, you know, you'll get more catches per unit of time in, so you can really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=496.6s	496.6	 practice your fundamentals. Now, ideally inertia should be on a harness right now, but I know I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=500.6s	500.6	 not going to overthrow it. So we're good. I want to make sure I'm always throwing well short,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=504.2s	504.2	 obviously. There you go. You see that last minute adjustment. You don't always have to have a giant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=508.5s	508.5	 field in which to exercise your dog or a really big yard. You can actually get a lot done in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=513.2s	513.2	 small area like this. You remember come around. Good. Go. There it is. That's a nice start there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=519.2s	519.2	 First throw. Go. Oh, pretty acrobatic catch. Go. Yes. That's it. You're getting confident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=531.0s	531.0	 That's it. You can see the light bulb going off, can't you? And to provide the dogs with a fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=536.6s	536.6	 and relaxing environment, we allow them to explore this foreign forest during a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=541.7s	541.7	 A dog has a very superior sense of smell. It's a completely new way to experience the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=547.7s	547.7	 relative to our sense. You can probably imagine that a lot of this foliage and life and all of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=554.0s	554.0	 these rocks and just every little thing here probably has a really unique scent to it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=559.5s	559.5	 And that is so fulfilling for dogs to be able to experience the world through their nose,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=564.7s	564.7	 as well as through their eyes and their ears and their sense of touch. A general guideline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=569.5s	569.5	 for walks like this for us anyway is we limit training to maybe five to ten percent of the walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=574.8s	574.8	 And Ursa loves jumping on these old logs. What? Did you get that? I didn't even see her go up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=579.1s	579.1	 there. I did. She scrambled. I may never leave. I'm just going to train dogs in the redwood forest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=583.9s	583.9	 for the rest of my life. So now I think we've created a monster. She is literally jumping on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=590.2s	590.2	 every log we come across. Just astonishing. Like you just keep getting things put into perspective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=595.6s	595.6	 for you just by walking by a tree. Dogs seem to make experiences like this so much more rich too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=601.6s	601.6	 Nurses found herself in a redwood tree. And so is Veronica. There she is. And let me give you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=612.7s	612.7	 like when they're babies. The history it probably has in front of it or the future, I think they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=616.7s	616.7	 call that by partnering with your dog and giving them the freedom to express themselves. I really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=621.4s	621.4	 think you'll achieve much richer results. The happiest dogs are the result of a training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ic93rofCo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=70&pp=iAQB&t=625.8s	625.8	 process that values their overall well-being above the mere management of their physical
