https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 So we've got a dog coming over here today that we're gonna meet and just kind of get to know the dog's name is Jersey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 He's a pit bull or pit bull mix. Not exactly sure. I've never met the dog and hopefully we can get some training done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=11.5s	11.5	 I'm just gonna do some freestyle training and see how it goes a little bit of a different video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=15.8s	15.8	 Click thumbs up for another video subscribe to my channel and this episode is brought to you by our amazing patrons on patreon

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=25.5s	25.5	 Apparently, he's a big jumper. That'll always be fun. You know how much I like high-energy dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=30.1s	30.1	 He knows some basics like sit down shake and some other stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 So that'll be exciting his energy level is only a seven, but they say he's very excited and jumps a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 So that's interesting. I guess he probably gets excited for short periods of time. It's probably like a level two out of three dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=45.1s	45.1	 So this is jersey the dog i'm doing some treat training with him right now just to see how he is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 Oh, it looks like he wants to roll over. Let's see. Will you roll over?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=53.1s	53.1	 Let's see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 We'll take a step back since we're in a new environment. There we go. All right, nice work jersey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 You're so good. Leave it alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 I didn't even ask for shake. Look at this. That's it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=65.4s	65.4	 Fine. I'll take shake. Yes. Can you sit pretty?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=71.2s	71.2	 Nice work, right? Excellent. Sit. Oh boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=76.2s	76.2	 Good leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=78.1s	78.1	 Look at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 Yes, got a glance there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 You know leave it look at me combo. I like to try that with every dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 I like to see if I can get their attention on me when there's a treat right in front of them training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=88.1s	88.1	 Isn't much good if they won't listen to you because they're so focused on a treat, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 So he feels like kind of a level two dog as I suspected, you know a little energetic but not hyper all the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=98.2s	98.2	 He's named after a cow. I think that's cute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=100.8s	100.8	 What cow a jersey cow? What's a jersey cow? It's a breed of cow the kind with spots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=105.3s	105.3	 We have a hoop here and we're gonna see if jersey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 Can jump through it teaching your dog to like jump over a bar or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 You know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 Like an agility jump is actually a lot easier than teaching them how to jump through a hoop because with a hoop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 You can see it's not just one area down here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 They have to avoid hitting the top and that can really make a lot of dogs uneasy about jumping through a hoop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=125.4s	125.4	 So that's why it's important to start really slow and not try to take steps that are too big when you're teaching this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=130.7s	130.7	 Jersey's really comfortable going through the hoop many dogs might be nervous of something like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=135.4s	135.4	 I'm gonna have to get one more here. There we go over that and look stepped over it. That's perfect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 You want to step over it again?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=141.8s	141.8	 It's off the ground good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 Nice work go ahead nice job. Let me see if I can get him to do a running start sit stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 Stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 Hoop look at that pretty good pretty good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 hoop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=157.8s	157.8	 Yeah, good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 Hoop. Yes. Oh, that was awesome. That was great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 Bottom line when you're teaching your dog how to jump through a hoop start really small gradually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 Increase the height of the hoop and if you start noticing your dog is refusing or not really enjoying it so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=174.5s	174.5	 Take a step back and continue to make it easier and don't rush it that goes that goes for everything in dog training though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 Come on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 That's a hug wow, you're so strong that was the start of a hug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=187.3s	187.3	 What do you think about doing a video on how to teach your dog to hug or we could just teach it right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=191.1s	191.1	 How about that if you were going to teach your dog how to hug you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=193.5s	193.5	 There's a couple of ways to do this. You could you know, whoa
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=198.1s	198.1	 First get a smaller dog that might help got a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 I'm going to encourage jersey and just kind of put his paws on me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=203.8s	203.8	 and if you're worried about your dog becoming a bad jumper because of this I wouldn't worry too much about it because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=209.4s	209.4	 Dogs understand context and anything with permission is okay. It's when they jump without permission. You gotta watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=218.3s	218.3	 All right, I haven't taught a dog to hug in a while here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 All right, i'm going to give jersey a little bit of assistance by putting his arm here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=228.4s	228.4	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 Now let's say you wanted to teach your dog how to give you a hug from behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=232.4s	232.4	 Your dog will need to know how to do a pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 You know a moderately advanced stay because you have to have them do a sit stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=240.2s	240.2	 Sit stay and you got to be able to turn your back on them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=243.8s	243.8	 Stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=249.4s	249.4	 Sit stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=252.7s	252.7	 See even when you ask your dog to stay and then you turn your back on them that can make it way more challenging for a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 of dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 Look at that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 How about that? Is that is that what you're going for close? Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=265.6s	265.6	 I'm gonna lure jersey up this way now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=268.7s	268.7	 And then just almost fine. I'll reward that because he tried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 sit stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=274.8s	274.8	 All right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=276.6s	276.6	 Oh, look at that. Oh, wow. We got lucky there. That was awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=280.6s	280.6	 And really it's just a matter of luring them up and getting them to stay i'm gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=283.8s	283.8	 Encourage him to stay by rapid firing some treats up there. Oh almost but you get the point there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 That's how you teach your dog to give you a hug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOBgJGYKds&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=436&pp=iAQB&t=293.8s	293.8	 Whoa let go
