https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Inertia was the most successful potty training experience I've ever had in my entire life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=4.9s	4.9	 And today I'm going to show you exactly what we did so that you can have the same success with your dog too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=9.9s	9.9	 I'm Zach George. I train dogs. This is my new dog and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=16.2s	16.2	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly. You can start from the beginning or you can pick up anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 Subscribe and hit the bell notification so you never miss an episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect, your results will forever remain in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=30.9s	30.9	 This is Inertia. Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 If there's one thing that everyone wants from their dog, it's for their dog to be potty trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 Right off the bat, to potty train your dog, you have to have great treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 Seriously, use the best treats that you can get. I use Pupford treats all of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=49.9s	49.9	 They're good because they taste great. These are the freeze-dried chicken ones and Inertia loves these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=55.5s	55.5	 There's 475 treats in here. Do you know how many things you could train with 475 treats?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=61.9s	61.9	 When you give your dog a high-quality treat like this, when they've had a successful potty outing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 you're helping them understand that doing their business where you want them to means they also get something fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 Pupford has an enormous selection of really high-end treats. That's important because lots of dogs like different things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=78.8s	78.8	 I'm going to have a link in the description where you can get all of Pupford's awesome training treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=83.4s	83.4	 You think she's trying to tell me something? Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 Inertia is just over a year old now and we've filmed all of her training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=91.3s	91.3	 Hopefully by now most of you have seen episode one where we literally picked Inertia up at eight weeks of age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=96.7s	96.7	 For obvious reasons, potty training was a major priority of ours from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=101.5s	101.5	 Whether you have a brand new puppy or dog or you're working on training with a dog that you've had for years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=105.9s	105.9	 my books are going to help you too. I'll have links in the description of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 Remember, when you're potty training a dog, managing where they can and can't go is critical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 Your goal is to prevent accidents wherever possible by keeping your dog under consistent supervision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=121.4s	121.4	 and by giving them more than enough opportunities to go potty in the correct places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=127.1s	127.1	 I highly recommend actually attaching your dog to yourself with a leash even indoors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=132.3s	132.3	 because it is so easy to become distracted even when you and your puppy are in the same room with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 I mean think about it, if you're always within six feet of your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=141.1s	141.1	 it makes it a lot easier to spot those warning signs of an impending accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=145.3s	145.3	 Now of course nobody is perfect but what do you do when you actually catch your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 in the process of having a potty accident?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 Do your best to interrupt them. With most puppies I do this just by picking them up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=156.4s	156.4	 and taking them to the spot where I want them to do their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 Oh oh oh poop oh oh boy they're falling out oh my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 Inertia I cannot believe you did that. Now the whole internet has seen it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 I mean in the same way that you wouldn't punish a baby for having an accident,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=174.1s	174.1	 we're not going to punish our dogs ever for things like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 And that goes for if you catch your dog in the act or if you discover an accident that happened hours ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=182.2s	182.2	 Remember dogs don't go in the house where they're not supposed to to spite you or to get revenge or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 And they also don't wait to intentionally come back inside to pee or poop because they're mad at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 So don't take it personally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=195.4s	195.4	 Let your efforts be focused on preventing future accidents and focusing on what you like rather than punishing what you dislike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 To prevent her from being able to have accidents in inappropriate places,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 Inertia had her own puppy bedroom downstairs in our house and I was very consistent about supervising her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 and keeping her near me when she was outside of that area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 And perhaps more importantly, I was really on top of letting her out super often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=220.6s	220.6	 You may even want to set an alarm or a timer to really help keep you on top of letting your dog outside often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=226.7s	226.7	 Puppies in particular sleep a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=229.2s	229.2	 Whenever they wake up, take them to the place you want them to go potty right away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 It's also a good idea to take them outside right after they've been playing for a minute or shortly after they eat and drink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=238.5s	238.5	 And basically if you're asking yourself if you should take your dog out, the answer is yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=243.1s	243.1	 It's much better to take your dog out too much than too little.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 When you give your dog potty breaks during potty training, be prepared to be outside for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=250.8s	250.8	 Give them ample time to sniff and check everything out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=253.9s	253.9	 And don't rush your dog during the potty training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=256.8s	256.8	 It's also really important to get your dog comfortable with their sleeping space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 where they'll be spending time when you can't directly supervise them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=263.5s	263.5	 In Inertia's case, I used a combination of the crate and exercise pen for her personal bedroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=269.3s	269.3	 I encouraged her to go in and out voluntarily using lots of great treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 so that she would learn to enjoy going in her crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=276.7s	276.7	 It really didn't take long either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 I did this very frequently throughout the first week that I had her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=281.5s	281.5	 and really avoided manually placing her in the crate the vast majority of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=286.1s	286.1	 If you get your dog really loving their crate or whatever setup you have for them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=289.4s	289.4	 this should make the general potty training process much smoother
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=292.3s	292.3	 because dogs tend to naturally avoid going potty in their sleeping area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 If you do notice that they're having accidents overnight in their sleeping area,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=300.6s	300.6	 then you'll probably need to make it a little bit smaller.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=302.9s	302.9	 Just experiment with your own dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=304.6s	304.6	 For example, initially I tried a little bit of a larger area overnight and put pads down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 Now, the reason I did this was to give Inertia a larger area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 and encourage her to be more comfortable because it was so early on in her training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=317.1s	317.1	 and it was more important for her to be comfortable than to be perfectly potty trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 I started closing the door to the crate overnight because dogs are less likely to have accidents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=325.4s	325.4	 if their sleeping area is smaller.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=327.3s	327.3	 However, I would use this expanded area with the crate and the playpen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=330.8s	330.8	 for short periods of management throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=333.6s	333.6	 I know some of you are wondering about potty pads
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=336.2s	336.2	 and I've considered this from a lot of different angles now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=339.4s	339.4	 I've actually evolved my opinion on the use of potty pads over the years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 I think they can be a great supplement to your potty training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=345.8s	345.8	 because it's always nice to have an indoor alternative for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=349.4s	349.4	 I mean, this can be especially useful during long periods of bad weather
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 or if you live in a high-rise building where it takes a while for your dog to get outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=356.9s	356.9	 or while you're traveling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=358.1s	358.1	 So it's up to you whether or not you'd like to use them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=360.1s	360.1	 By the end of Inertia's first week, things were going alright.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=363.0s	363.0	 She's had what? What do you think, Bree? Maybe like four or five accidents?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=365.8s	365.8	 Whoa, whoa, poop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=367.3s	367.3	 Yeah, maybe like four or five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=368.6s	368.6	 Maybe one a day and it's always because I'm being careless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=371.3s	371.3	 Or I'm being careless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=372.5s	372.5	 Right. But the good news is she's yet to have an accident in her crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=376.5s	376.5	 I've been letting her out very consistently once an hour or so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=379.7s	379.7	 maybe a little bit less than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=381.2s	381.2	 Every time I let her out of the crate, we immediately go outside or to a potty pad in the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 because remember, I want her going on the pads and I want her going outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=388.4s	388.4	 because it gives me options in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=390.2s	390.2	 As the weeks went on, potty training challenges began to increase a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=394.7s	394.7	 probably because I was starting to get a little too relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=398.1s	398.1	 Many people are under the impression that potty training can be done in like a week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=401.4s	401.4	 but not really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=402.4s	402.4	 Right at the three-week mark, I think it's easy to let your guard down on potty training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=407.1s	407.1	 especially if you are having a lot of success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=409.1s	409.1	 But I think it's more important than ever to really double down on your efforts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=412.7s	412.7	 and keep it top of mind, make sure that you get your dog out on a regular schedule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=417.1s	417.1	 Even when you think they probably don't have to go,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=419.0s	419.0	 it's a good idea to take them out more rather than less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=422.4s	422.4	 But as I got to know Inertia better,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=424.2s	424.2	 I was able to make better gains on our potty training efforts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=428.1s	428.1	 We've gone like three or four days without an accident at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=431.4s	431.4	 So I'm fully prepared for setbacks as is common with potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=435.7s	435.7	 So I'm not going to get too excited yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=437.8s	437.8	 But to review, in short, the formula for potty training is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=440.7s	440.7	 relentlessly controlling their environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=443.3s	443.3	 while taking them outside more than they need to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=446.2s	446.2	 Every time that I catch her having an accident, I just kick myself because it's like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=449.9s	449.9	 I should have let her out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 But I just, you know, pick her up and take her outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=453.4s	453.4	 There's no scolding or anything like that because I don't want her to get this complex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=457.3s	457.3	 about going potty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=458.6s	458.6	 Sometimes when I have her in the house still on leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=460.7s	460.7	 I'm much better about detecting when I think she's about to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=464.3s	464.3	 Now, again, I think that's probably too late.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=466.4s	466.4	 I should be letting her out before I even detect that she's sniffing around because she has to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=470.8s	470.8	 Like, what do you think this is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=472.1s	472.1	 Do you think maybe she has to go right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=474.2s	474.2	 I don't know. That makes me nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=475.4s	475.4	 I'm going to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=476.1s	476.1	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=477.1s	477.1	 Okay, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=478.2s	478.2	 Do you have to go pee?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=480.7s	480.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=481.8s	481.8	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=483.4s	483.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=484.5s	484.5	 That's exactly what I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=485.5s	485.5	 You've got to really get to know your dog's individual body language
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=488.2s	488.2	 and the way that they foreshadow, hey, I'm about to go potty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=491.6s	491.6	 So if you ever have a question as to whether or not you should take your dog outside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=495.1s	495.1	 take them outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=496.0s	496.0	 And as the days went on, I slowly began to grant inertia more and more freedom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=500.7s	500.7	 Dogs learn pretty quickly not to go in their direct sleeping area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=504.7s	504.7	 So by keeping their sleeping area relatively small at first and then gradually increasing it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=509.4s	509.4	 they'll be much more likely to succeed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=511.5s	511.5	 You might notice here I have enlarged her area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=514.4s	514.4	 While we pretty much always have this up most of the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=517.4s	517.4	 we've moved to keeping the second door over here open full time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=521.6s	521.6	 so that she has permanent access to a larger area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=524.6s	524.6	 She's got lots of toys in here, lots of different textures of things to chew on and play with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=529.1s	529.1	 It was becoming very routine for her to spend a couple hours easy at a time in here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=533.4s	533.4	 and not have any accidents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=535.0s	535.0	 The other night I tried leaving it completely open overnight, no accidents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=539.8s	539.8	 And then it's been like three nights in a row now, no accidents over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=544.0s	544.0	 So there's no reason we can't expand her living area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=546.6s	546.6	 It can take some time for a dog to generalize your entire house as their home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=552.2s	552.2	 So increase their access to the house slowly and methodically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=556.2s	556.2	 and don't hesitate to take a step back if they have a relapse in potty accidents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=560.6s	560.6	 By this point, Inertia was doing great on her general potty training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=563.8s	563.8	 but she still had excitement urination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=566.6s	566.6	 That's where some dogs just get so excited that they can't keep their pee inside of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=571.2s	571.2	 I mean, it happens to all of us, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=574.2s	574.2	 In Inertia's case, anytime she would see our friends or our family,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=578.1s	578.1	 she would become overjoyed and pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=580.6s	580.6	 The way I dealt with this was by trying to get her to go potty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=583.4s	583.4	 just before I knew she was about to encounter someone exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=586.4s	586.4	 and by encouraging family to be very calm or even ignore her for the first several minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=591.4s	591.4	 Of course, my dad, well, he was never great about taking direction from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=597.7s	597.7	 There's the pee. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=602.5s	602.5	 Most dogs will outgrow this kind of excitement urination by the time they're 18 months or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=607.5s	607.5	 It's also really important to remember that nothing throws off potty training progress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=612.4s	612.4	 like going to a new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=614.5s	614.5	 And you might remember a few months ago, we took a trip to Corpus Christi, Texas,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=618.1s	618.1	 and Inertia had a potty accident, even though she had been flawless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=622.2s	622.2	 for several months leading up to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=624.0s	624.0	 It's just, Oh, Inertia, what are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=628.6s	628.6	 Okay, we'll need to clean that up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=630.1s	630.1	 And that's her first accident in, I mean, months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=632.9s	632.9	 And see if she had been off leash, I might not have even noticed that body accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=637.1s	637.1	 Really, it's vital to have them on leash and under control when introducing them to new places,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=642.2s	642.2	 particularly when they're young or untrained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=645.0s	645.0	 So with all of that said, how do you actually know when potty training is complete?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=650.6s	650.6	 When your dog goes a good couple of months with virtually no potty accidents,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=654.5s	654.5	 and they can make it several hours between breaks, you're pretty much there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=658.8s	658.8	 But remember, with house training like this, regressions are still fairly common and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=662.7s	662.7	 always, always be prepared to take a step back and modify their environment to make things easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=668.2s	668.2	 for them. I mean, the occasional accident during your dog's first couple of years of life is normal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=673.0s	673.0	 but make sure to analyze each instance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=675.4s	675.4	 Ask yourself, for example, did your dog have a change in their environment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=678.6s	678.6	 Or has it been too long between breaks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=680.6s	680.6	 And plan accordingly for the future so that you can prevent it from happening again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=684.5s	684.5	 If you notice that your dog is having increased accidents, seemingly out of nowhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=688.3s	688.3	 it could be a medical issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=689.7s	689.7	 So check with your vet to make sure your dog is healthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VGMZnYOArI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=692.2s	692.2	 Good luck on your potty training and be sure to get Pupford Training Treats at the link in
