https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=1.6s	1.6	 Here's a fun game you can play to get your dog to come to you when you call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=4.7s	4.7	 See this treat? Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 The second he turns around to look at me, I'm going to offer him another treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=9.9s	9.9	 in order to incentivize him to come to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=12.9s	12.9	 And see, this just gets your dog in the habit of walking away from you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 and then looking up to say, hey, is there more?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 So I'm going to be right there to say, I appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 Here's an awesome Pupford treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 Now he's just automatically coming to me every time he gets that treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=25.3s	25.3	 That's the kind of behavior you want to instill in your dog in beginning training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 Treats are an important part of training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=31.2s	31.2	 So whenever you're teaching a dog, especially something new,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 you want to get them willingly focusing on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=35.8s	35.8	 That's how we keep their attention when they're young and new to training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=38.6s	38.6	 And it's also the secret to marathon training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=41.8s	41.8	 You've seen me use these new Pupford treats in videos now for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 I use them because they're awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=46.4s	46.4	 I think Rochow would agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=47.7s	47.7	 From a training perspective, I like that these are really dry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=50.2s	50.2	 so they're not very messy, but they're still very palatable to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=53.6s	53.6	 There's 450 treats per bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 I mean, that's enough training for a whole dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 These are actually freeze dried beef liver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 Turns out dogs really like beef liver.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=62.7s	62.7	 Check the link in the description to get your freeze dried beef liver treats from Pupford.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=74.3s	74.3	 I'll have a link below and get a copy of my bestselling book, Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 That link will be below, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=78.9s	78.9	 It's very normal to want your dog to listen to you without treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 but getting there, that's a completely different story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=84.2s	84.2	 In today's video, I'm going to show you how to get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 Let's meet Nathan and his dog, Blue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 Hi, my name is Nathan and this is my dog, Blue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Blue here is a Belgian Malinois.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 I got Blue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 I've heard a lot of good things about Malinois online.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=96.5s	96.5	 As far as like training goes, they're high energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=98.8s	98.8	 And also, I wanted a dog with a little less hair than the one I have now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 which is a German Shepherd.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=103.3s	103.3	 He's very good at training as long as I have a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 He'll train all day long if I got treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 but if I don't have anything in my hand, he's not as interested in training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 Zach, show me what to do to get Blue to listen to me without treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Nathan, I totally get what you're going through here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=118.1s	118.1	 I mean, it can be frustrating when we're trying to get our dog to listen to us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=120.6s	120.6	 and feel like we need treats all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 But dogs learn by associating various actions with the outcomes of those actions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=126.9s	126.9	 For that reason, it's essential to create pleasant outcomes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=129.8s	129.8	 from your dog's perspective over a longer period of time than you might actually think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 Therefore, during your first year of training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 your focus needs to be on creating outcomes that you and your dog like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=138.9s	138.9	 in a multitude of different scenarios and in different places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 Nathan, would you mind if I work with Blue for a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=144.9s	144.9	 and kind of show you what you need to do to get Blue to be less treat dependent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=148.7s	148.7	 No problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=149.1s	149.1	 So I'm going to start off by working with Blue right here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=151.8s	151.8	 just by treating him on something easy like sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=153.9s	153.9	 I'm curious to know if Blue will sit while moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 So let's see. Blue, come here. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=158.8s	158.8	 I'm going to reward for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Since this is my first time ever working with Blue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 I'm going to be very generous on my rewards in the beginning and use lots of treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 So far, that's 100 percent of the time that Blue has honored my request to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 OK, I'll take it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=172.4s	172.4	 Right there, he showed some initiative and gave me a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 I'm going to reward that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 But when you're in a groove with your dog like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=177.7s	177.7	 you might try to reward a little bit less frequently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=180.2s	180.2	 So, for example, sit. OK, good. Come on. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=185.1s	185.1	 OK, good. And let's go back here and sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 Perfect. In that instance, I rewarded after three consecutive sits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=194.5s	194.5	 This is the process that you go through to wean your dog off of treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=198.1s	198.1	 So out here in this relatively low distraction setting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 I'm able to reward Blue every three times or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=203.7s	203.7	 If you went to a crowded area where your dog was really distracted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=206.7s	206.7	 like, say, a concert, for example, you wouldn't try to get away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 with rewarding your dog one out of three times until they've proven they're more reliable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 So it's a gradual process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=214.8s	214.8	 The idea is to really keep your dog guessing when you're trying to wean them off of treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 But remember, this is something that needs to go on over the next year or so of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=222.9s	222.9	 Most people expect their dogs to start listening without treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=226.3s	226.3	 after they've demonstrated that they'll understand something in a limited number of contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 For example, in your house or in a quiet neighborhood setting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=233.8s	233.8	 we want to keep our dogs guessing in their mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=236.3s	236.3	 They need to think they have a chance at getting rewarded over an extended period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 before you expect them to truly internalize and generalize skills like sit in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 Right there, he's distracted by a butterfly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=249.4s	249.4	 Come here. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=250.6s	250.6	 I'm going to go ahead and give him a treat because that was very enticing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 And I want to make sure he knows that, look, during this period of your training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=257.6s	257.6	 if you'll listen to me, I'm going to provide desirable things around instances where he listens to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=262.8s	262.8	 Good job, Blue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=263.6s	263.6	 You also want to mix up the frequency with which you reward from training session to training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 based on how challenging that specific training session is to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 If something happened, like right now I've got bikes coming over here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=275.1s	275.1	 that's a distraction to Blue, then I might up my rate of reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=278.8s	278.8	 and reward more until he's proven that he'll listen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=281.6s	281.6	 So I'm going to try and get a look at me as these bikes pass by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=284.3s	284.3	 Look at me. Sit. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 Right there. That was great. I got to look at me and I got to sit and a voluntary down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=291.2s	291.2	 Let's see if I can bring him into an up. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 And on all fours, stand and sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=296.9s	296.9	 And now I'm going to reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=298.1s	298.1	 But do you see how I'm being really selective about when I reward as that distraction was really near?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 I was super generous with my rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=305.1s	305.1	 But as the distraction got farther away and I really had Blue's attention on me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 then I felt more comfortable and rewarding less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=310.9s	310.9	 So you have to be really flexible when it comes to rewarding your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=314.4s	314.4	 with the end goal being to wean them off of treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=316.7s	316.7	 at least for basic obedience and stuff like sit, lie down and look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 It's really important to adequately prepare your dog in the context in which you want them to listen ahead of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 in a very deliberate, premeditated way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=328.5s	328.5	 For example, you'll need to go to crowded places and areas that are super distracting for your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=333.1s	333.1	 with the sole intention of working with your dog, not necessarily going there to enjoy yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=338.2s	338.2	 But you could still do that, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=339.5s	339.5	 I mean, training our dog is fun, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=341.0s	341.0	 But Nathan, you know, with a good percentage of dogs, and I have a feeling Blue is one of those dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=345.1s	345.1	 you can get by with hardly ever having to reward them with food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=348.5s	348.5	 The moment I break out the tug toy, you could just see him light up and he's like, oh, I like this game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=353.9s	353.9	 There's no reserve nature about you here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=355.9s	355.9	 Oh, look at that. That's a Malon Waff I've ever seen one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=358.6s	358.6	 Look at this. Immediately into the game of tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=361.3s	361.3	 Tug of War is really one of the most underestimated forms of currency for a dog like Blue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=366.3s	366.3	 This may be a more powerful way to motivate him to listen to you than food could ever be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=370.8s	370.8	 Not all dogs are motivated by play like this, but if your dog plays and lights up for a game of tug like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=375.6s	375.6	 that means play or tug of war in this case is a serious currency for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 It's a great way to motivate them. So let me show you how we would do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=382.5s	382.5	 This is one of those things that people just don't get immediately, but it can change everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=387.7s	387.7	 Sit. Yes, get it. Go on, get it. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=392.3s	392.3	 I'm going to play for about five seconds here just to let him know you listen to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=396.0s	396.0	 I'll play with you for a second. It takes a little polishing in the beginning here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=401.0s	401.0	 Yes, go on, get it. You see how I start shaking it right there to make it interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=404.8s	404.8	 It's a shaking tug toy like that can be really exciting for Blue. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=408.8s	408.8	 And if you've ever seen them train Malon Waz and many other dogs for police work or for dog sport,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=414.2s	414.2	 this is what they use to motivate them. Tug of War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=416.3s	416.3	 Even for my own dogs, when I used to do frisbee dog competitions, Tug of War was a massive motivator for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=421.4s	421.4	 Sit. And right there, he's jumping for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=425.8s	425.8	 We'll just withhold the rewards when he jumps for it. That's all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=428.4s	428.4	 I'm just pulling it away and being like, no, you're not going to get tug if you jump for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=431.3s	431.3	 And there was a roller blader that just went by. He didn't even notice if I have this tug toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=434.9s	434.9	 He's like, I want that. And when your dog is saying, I want that, use it to your advantage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=439.2s	439.2	 You really don't need to use treats if you can get your dog working for tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 For a dog that's willing to play tug like this, it can be magical and accelerate your training at light speed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=448.6s	448.6	 Nathan, why don't you see if you can get Blue playing tug with you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=450.7s	450.7	 Curious to see how this looks. There you go. Pick up that energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=454.5s	454.5	 Get into it a little bit, because look how energetic he is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=456.7s	456.7	 Match that energy in your own special way. I know not everyone acts like a clown like me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=461.6s	461.6	 There you go. That's what I'm talking about. Good. Beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=464.6s	464.6	 Now, let go. Ask him to sit. Okay, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=469.7s	469.7	 Reward. More enthusiastic. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=472.7s	472.7	 Like, yes, you got to really ignite that excitement in him. There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=476.5s	476.5	 You said you were only playing tug of war about once a week or so with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=479.5s	479.5	 This needs to be central to your training. If you can get a dog playing with you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaK-4KjByeo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=352&pp=iAQB&t=483.2s	483.2	 you'll get a dog that listens to you. Pup for treats are the perfect balance between
