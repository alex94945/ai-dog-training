https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today I'm going to show you everything I've been doing over the past year to train my dog Inertia to walk on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 I'm Zach George. I train dogs. This is my new dog and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly. You can start from the beginning or you can pick up anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=18.6s	18.6	 Subscribe and hit the bell notification so you never miss an episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect, your results will forever remain in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=27.7s	27.7	 This is Inertia. Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 Leash training can be one of the toughest things to train a dog. Getting a training box sent to you based on your dog's specific age is a way to keep you motivated to keep you on track so that your dog is awesome in no time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=45.7s	45.7	 For example, this is the six month box and let me show you how this works. You get a surprisingly detailed training guide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 For a six month old dog, it's time to start refining and getting those leash skills looking better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=56.9s	56.9	 In addition to the training guide, they send you training supplies too. You'll find that you can never have enough leashes lying around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=62.6s	62.6	 The feeling of this is really dynamic. I think Inertia is going to be like, what is that alien material?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=68.3s	68.3	 They sent honey coconut scented shampoo and it smells exactly like that. Only your dog can hear this apparently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=74.5s	74.5	 All right, let's see if she can hear it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=78.1s	78.1	 Oh my gosh. So it's like a silent squeaker to us, but they get the satisfaction of hearing a squeak. Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=85.8s	85.8	 Oh yeah, she's going to love that. These are turkey tendon strips. Really interesting texture on these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=91.6s	91.6	 You definitely need good training treats if you're going to train a dog. And because Inertia is over a year, she gets an adult box too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=97.5s	97.5	 This came in her adult box. Check this out. She's going to go crazy over this. Oh my god.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=102.6s	102.6	 This is like extreme tug of war. Look at this. But when you just have something new and random that you would never think to get in a million years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 and you find that your dog just goes crazy over it, that's really a way to energize your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 Enter my special code ZACH to get 50% off of your first pup box when you sign up for a 3, 6 or 12 month plan at PupBox.com slash ZACH.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 I'll have that link and discount code in the description of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 Leash walking. For many people, it's one of the most challenging things about training their dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=132.7s	132.7	 Leash walking typically takes many months to master, but there are a lot of variables involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=138.1s	138.1	 Like how consistent you are, how energetic your particular dog is, and your pre-existing communication with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 First, a very important piece of advice. If you have a high energy dog, it's critical that you get their energy out of them just prior to doing these leash training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 It's these high energy dogs that we've selected for over the centuries and their energy made them very valuable to us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=161.7s	161.7	 So we have to be fair to those genetic tendencies by giving them an outlet for all of that energy before these leash walking sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 In other words, walking nicely on leash for energetic dogs is a pretty unnatural thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 If you're at a plateau on this and you've been struggling with this with your own dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 you might find that exercising them just before a leash training session might make all of the difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=183.2s	183.2	 Now, you'll also want to make sure that your dog has a basic grasp of the basics, like leave it and look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 And that you've taken the time to get them comfortable with wearing their collar and their harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 If your dog doesn't know a lot of these basic things, you can start at the beginning of this series,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 and maybe pick up a copy of both of my books too to learn how to train them in detail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 Once you have those basics down, you're ready to start with leash walking training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 One of the big secrets about dog training is that whenever you're teaching your dog something new,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=211.8s	211.8	 do it in an easy environment, like inside of your house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=215.5s	215.5	 You'll remember with Inersha, her first leash walking lessons were all indoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=220.1s	220.1	 That's because it was a lot easier for her to listen in an indoor familiar environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 than it would be for a dog to listen in an outdoor environment of virtually any kind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 If you've tried leash walking outside before, it's possible that you've encountered a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=234.2s	234.2	 who is far too distracted by their surroundings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=236.7s	236.7	 I mean, think about it, they see you all the time, but being outside is far more stimulating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=241.8s	241.8	 because so many things are different and new, and dogs are really curious by nature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=246.6s	246.6	 So making it easy for your dog to succeed, especially early on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=250.4s	250.4	 is going to make things way smoother.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=252.2s	252.2	 During my first leash walking lessons with Inersha,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 we would practice walking around inside the house while she was on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=258.6s	258.6	 So I like to do these early lessons, which are basically just look at me while moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=263.2s	263.2	 I do that so I can verify that my dog is paying attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=266.3s	266.3	 At first, there's literally nothing wrong with holding up a treat just like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 if you've got to get your dog to voluntarily stay with you and stay on a loose leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 And the logic here behind using treats for this is that you're keeping your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=279.7s	279.7	 in a really upbeat frame of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=282.2s	282.2	 See that? Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=283.3s	283.3	 At first, you might find it really natural to kind of manipulate them and jerk them around a bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 with the leash and their harness or collar, but that doesn't really teach them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 We have to really show them how to voluntarily go through the motions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 if we're concerned with long-term success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 And the reason I like to have a dog look at me is to verify that I have their attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=299.8s	299.8	 when I ask for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=300.9s	300.9	 So in other words, the goal of these early sessions are to get them to take sometimes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=304.7s	304.7	 just one or two or three steps in a row without having any tension on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=309.8s	309.8	 Take it any way that you can get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=311.9s	311.9	 You'll find that your dog seems to learn at a much faster rate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=316.2s	316.2	 when they're eagerly paying attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=318.6s	318.6	 Once I really felt that Inertia was starting to grasp this concept of look at me while we walked,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=323.7s	323.7	 then I would start to ask her to change directions more randomly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=327.4s	327.4	 While you're practicing, if you think your dog is about to start speeding up or pulling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=331.8s	331.8	 stop immediately or even start walking in the opposite direction in order to preempt the pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=336.9s	336.9	 Doing this consistently will teach your dog that if they pull on their leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=340.6s	340.6	 they're not going to get to go where they want to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=342.6s	342.6	 Remember, the best time to address a behavior that you don't want to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=347.4s	347.4	 is before it occurs, not after it occurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=350.4s	350.4	 This applies to leash walking as well as virtually any other bad habit you can think of too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=355.0s	355.0	 In the beginning, when you're introducing this concept,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=357.2s	357.2	 really focus on a couple of weeks of doing this a few times a day in like five-minute increments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 I do want to talk briefly about using corrective collars like choke chains,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=365.5s	365.5	 prong collars, or even electric collars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=367.5s	367.5	 I don't recommend using any aversive tools like these when training dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=371.0s	371.0	 because there are too many side effects and it could actually make training take even longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=374.8s	374.8	 I mean, let's take a common example where you might be tempted to physically correct
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=378.5s	378.5	 with one of these collars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=379.4s	379.4	 Say your dog is reacting to another dog on a walk and barking vigorously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=383.9s	383.9	 You may inadvertently be creating a scenario where your dog learns to associate the harsh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=388.4s	388.4	 correction with the presence of other dogs on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=391.3s	391.3	 So this could further amplify issues like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=394.1s	394.1	 I'm not saying people who use these collars are in any way bad people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=397.4s	397.4	 I'm just saying that there might be more benefits to using a different approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=401.4s	401.4	 Another thing is that dogs are pretty smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=403.3s	403.3	 So they come to know when that special collar is around the neck versus when it's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=408.0s	408.0	 So if they're wearing a normal collar or harness,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=410.7s	410.7	 then you're likely to see the behavior come right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=413.8s	413.8	 So essentially those collars can act as a patch and we all know that patches can eventually fail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=418.4s	418.4	 So I recommend actually taking the time to teach your dog and really walk through the motions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=423.3s	423.3	 of how to walk nicely on leash over an extended period of time while being very patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=428.8s	428.8	 That way you'll end up with a dog who listens to you regardless of the type of collar or harness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=432.9s	432.9	 they're wearing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=433.6s	433.6	 Okay, so once your dog is walking well while indoors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=436.7s	436.7	 you're ready to start taking your training outdoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=439.3s	439.3	 But this is a big step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=441.3s	441.3	 Now don't expect to just take off down the street and have a perfectly well-behaved dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=445.4s	445.4	 As we discussed before, moving from inside to outside involves a lot of training challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=451.2s	451.2	 Since the outdoors is so tempting and distracting for most dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=454.9s	454.9	 it's a good idea to give your dog some time to observe, sniff around a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=459.0s	459.0	 and take in that new environment before you ask them to start focusing on the training lesson at hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=463.9s	463.9	 So be tolerant of leash pulling and things like that during this adjustment period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=468.2s	468.2	 Ideally, at first with these outdoor lessons,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=470.6s	470.6	 you'll want to stay very close to your home and practice over a short distance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=474.2s	474.2	 like walking in circles in your driveway,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=476.2s	476.2	 or back and forth on the sidewalk just in front of your house or apartment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=479.7s	479.7	 The first time I did a leash training session with Inersha outside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=482.6s	482.6	 we just stayed on a little patch of pavement in our backyard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=485.4s	485.4	 And remember, your mindset when you're doing a training walk like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=488.9s	488.9	 must be different than a more casual walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=491.4s	491.4	 For example, during a training walk, you don't have a destination in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=495.0s	495.0	 You're not even trying to travel any significant distance, especially early on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=499.0s	499.0	 You just want to be able to get your dog to take 10 steps in a row without pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=502.8s	502.8	 So be willing to cover the same stretch of ground over and over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=505.9s	505.9	 when you're training your dog in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=507.4s	507.4	 If you're trying to get somewhere specific,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 or if you're trying to go a certain distance to exercise your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=511.8s	511.8	 you're much more likely to feel frustrated during your walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=514.3s	514.3	 So let your training walks be 100% focused on leash training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=518.6s	518.6	 And remember to be tolerant when you're doing other types of walks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=521.8s	521.8	 like potty breaks or free walks, which I talked about in a recent video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=525.2s	525.2	 This will really help you stay consistent and get the fastest results possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=529.9s	529.9	 As you walk, reward your dog big time when there's no tension on the leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=534.0s	534.0	 and give them a big jackpot reward every time they offer their attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=538.1s	538.1	 Ideally, you'll get good at reading your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=540.0s	540.0	 and you'll be able to detect when pulling is about to occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=542.6s	542.6	 So if you notice that your dog is picking up the pace,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=544.8s	544.8	 or you're approaching something really exciting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=547.3s	547.3	 this is your cue to slow down or change directions proactively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=551.6s	551.6	 And again, I want to be very clear about that distinction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=554.2s	554.2	 between a training walk and say a socialization experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=558.6s	558.6	 For example, when Inertia was a puppy, I would take her down to the French Quarter here in New
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=562.8s	562.8	 Orleans just to give her exposure. And the priority in those sessions was just to show her things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=567.8s	567.8	 not to teach her to walk nicely on a leash while in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=570.7s	570.7	 We have to work up to those things, especially with young dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=573.5s	573.5	 And so it's always important to be mindful of what is surrounding you and your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=577.8s	577.8	 when you're asking them to listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=579.6s	579.6	 If it's a brand new place with new smells, sights, and sounds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=583.0s	583.0	 then you have to be very tolerant of that with an inexperienced dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=586.7s	586.7	 And just let them check things out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=588.6s	588.6	 And remember, by new environments, I'm not necessarily talking about a place miles from home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=593.4s	593.4	 Just another 20 feet down the street may have all sorts of new things that get your dog's attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=598.6s	598.6	 So be understanding every time you take your dog to a new place,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=602.2s	602.2	 even if you think it's not really that new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=604.7s	604.7	 When you do encounter a genuine distraction in the real world, like another dog or a squirrel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=610.7s	610.7	 look at this as a golden training opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=613.6s	613.6	 Rather than force the issue and get very close to those things that you know your dog is likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=617.9s	617.9	 to be heavily distracted by, create a little bit of distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=621.2s	621.2	 When you think that you've created enough distance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=623.4s	623.4	 you can test your dog for compliance by asking them to do something that they're usually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=627.8s	627.8	 really good at, like sit, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=629.9s	629.9	 And when you find that spot and your dog does sit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=632.5s	632.5	 that might be your working distance from the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=635.4s	635.4	 For some dogs, that working distance might be a half a mile away, and that's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=640.2s	640.2	 If your dog is too distracted to give you their attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=642.7s	642.7	 try being a little bit more interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=644.2s	644.2	 This can work sometimes with some dogs, or even putting a treat at their nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=647.6s	647.6	 to let them know that you have something good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=649.6s	649.6	 Another thing you can do is to walk backwards to encourage your dog to follow you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=653.4s	653.4	 That's a bit more natural for some dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=655.3s	655.3	 Now, there's no doubt that training polite leash walking to a lot of dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=658.7s	658.7	 is definitely easier said than done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=660.7s	660.7	 It's unrealistic to resolve this overnight, but let your focus be on good leash skills,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=665.0s	665.0	 trending better and better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=666.6s	666.6	 In the meantime, as you're working on this, you might wonder how consistent you need to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=670.9s	670.9	 In many areas of training, it's very reasonable to be 90 plus percent consistent with your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=676.0s	676.0	 For example, if you're training, leave it, you can with 90 percent likelihood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=679.9s	679.9	 cover up the treat before your dog gets to it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=682.9s	682.9	 But we must build in exceptions for leash training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=686.3s	686.3	 For example, let's say you've got a five month old dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=688.5s	688.5	 who doesn't have the best leash walking skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=691.1s	691.1	 You must be tolerant of natural behavior to a point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=694.3s	694.3	 Dogs walk more quickly than we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=696.2s	696.2	 They're curious, and this idea of walking slowly while attached with a leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=699.9s	699.9	 is very foreign to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=701.4s	701.4	 So in cases where you really have to get somewhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=703.7s	703.7	 if you're walking your dog and you've got to take them to the vet, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=706.6s	706.6	 you'll just have to be tolerant of the leash pulling for now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=709.3s	709.3	 But just be sure to set aside lots of time of leash walking practice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=712.6s	712.6	 when you're able to focus exclusively on your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=715.7s	715.7	 Keep the big picture in mind, especially during your dog's first couple of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=719.8s	719.8	 If your dog was unruly on leash 90 percent of the time when you first started,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiRNkYT0oY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=724.0s	724.0	 and now they're only terrible on leash 50 percent of the time,
