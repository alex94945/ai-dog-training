https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=355.6s	355.6	 hopefully we'll be able to get into the protest march and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=358.5s	358.5	 participate more directly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=360.2s	360.2	 You go closer. You're on your game today. I mean, I have to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=367.3s	367.3	 Veronica, keep your dog from jumping on strangers as they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=370.1s	370.1	 walk by, for example, good management. That was so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=373.7s	373.7	 Tell me how training is going with her right now. Now that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 we're living. I mean, look at her. She's all over the place,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=378.5s	378.5	 but she's being kind of good. As we got closer. It was not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=381.3s	381.3	 lost on Veronica that her environment was more densely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=384.4s	384.4	 populated with people and dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 Bree decided to address Veronica's excitement barking by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=393.2s	393.2	 pulling off to the side and reminding her what quiet means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 Yes. Good. She's being really good. Yeah, she really is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=405.2s	405.2	 It's amazing because you have the dog walk by, you have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=407.6s	407.6	 crowd chanting, you got an airplane fly over all at one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=411.5s	411.5	 time. So we've just been coming back here for like a minute or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=414.2s	414.2	 two. Good girl. And then when she seems like she's relaxed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=418.1s	418.1	 then we can go back up there. Right. Then we'll probably come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=420.3s	420.3	 back. Oh, the motorcycles are coming again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=421.9s	421.9	 Yes. Yes. Quiet. That's perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=429.4s	429.4	 So you know, I mean, we've got dogs here, dogs here, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=433.6s	433.6	 Veronica here doing a great job. Bree was able to successfully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=437.2s	437.2	 let her observe the dog and then call her back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=440.4s	440.4	 Veronica loves everyone, but we don't necessarily want her going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=443.8s	443.8	 up to everyone that she wants to go up to. Watch how Bree blocks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=447.4s	447.4	 Veronica's access to the people, asks her to sit politely and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=450.9s	450.9	 look at her all seamlessly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=452.9s	452.9	 That was the first time she didn't jump on someone that she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=454.9s	454.9	 could reach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=455.6s	455.6	 Oh, that's good. Yeah, but you really have to be on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=458.1s	458.1	 Good girl. Okay. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=460.7s	460.7	 Throughout our time at the protest, Veronica adjusted well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=463.7s	463.7	 and she was able to act relatively calm in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=466.8s	466.8	 extraordinary setting. After a long stimulating day, Veronica
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=471.1s	471.1	 needed some rest and we needed to go out and have some us time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=475.0s	475.0	 So you're finally comfortable with Veronica being alone at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=479.0s	479.0	 house while we go out to a prolonged dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=482.1s	482.1	 In general, Veronica has been really well behaved and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=484.8s	484.8	 non destructive. And we've shown you how we've taught her to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=487.4s	487.4	 behave that way throughout this series. So we made the decision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=490.2s	490.2	 to leave her in our living room while we went out instead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=493.3s	493.3	 leaving her in a crate, which seems to cause her pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=495.8s	495.8	 significant stress, at least now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=497.7s	497.7	 The feeling of like leaving her and not knowing if she's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=500.4s	500.4	 to be okay was really paralyzing me from even trying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=504.4s	504.4	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=504.8s	504.8	 But now I can check on her and I can see that she's totally fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=507.6s	507.6	 Let's check on her now and see how she's doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=509.3s	509.3	 She heard something outside. Hey, Veronica, can you be quiet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=512.8s	512.8	 It's okay. Relax. Good job. It's gonna give you a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=522.5s	522.5	 We're gonna be sitting there dinner and she's gonna have that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=524.6s	524.6	 propped up so she has a permanent eye on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=526.6s	526.6	 I just checked on Veronica. I was like, where is she? I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=531.3s	531.3	 discovered how good the zoom is on the Furbos. I was like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=535.7s	535.7	 searching for looking around then I was able to zoom in. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=539.4s	539.4	 there she was. After going out to dinner, we'd be like, let's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=542.4s	542.4	 rush home now and make sure the dogs are okay. Exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=545.8s	545.8	 Here you go. You can see that. Veronica and Inersha are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=549.2s	549.2	 perfectly content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=550.7s	550.7	 Yeah, she's just sleeping in her spot being totally perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=554.2s	554.2	 And where's Veronica? Oh, my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=558.0s	558.0	 Alright, so she was barking for a second, but then she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=560.1s	560.1	 resettled. So this is also good data, not just for our own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=563.4s	563.4	 sanity. But it's good data to know how she's behaving when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=567.0s	567.0	 we're not there. As an instrument of science. It is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=570.4s	570.4	 fantastic. We're home. Dogs are up there. Inersha does this all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=575.0s	575.0	 the time. But Veronica is taking this to the next level. She's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=577.2s	577.2	 like pressing on the window. You're not used to us coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=580.0s	580.0	 home. You're used to being with us so much of the time. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=586.6s	586.6	 you did so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=589.3s	589.3	 Good job, guys. Thanks for puppy sitting, Inersha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=593.1s	593.1	 Fantastic. For those of us who have multiple dogs, keeping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=596.4s	596.4	 peace and order is of the highest importance. For example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=599.6s	599.6	 many dogs might guard resources such as chews or toys. In fact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=604.2s	604.2	 if you've watched Inersha's training series, you'll remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=607.1s	607.1	 that guarding things was very natural to her. Excellent. Love
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=610.6s	610.6	 how she looked at them. She's focused on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=613.1s	613.1	 Is she being protective? Is she gonna bite me? Yeah, look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=616.6s	616.6	 that. She's resource guarding. In fact, this resource guarding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=621.4s	621.4	 was such a hot topic on my channel that some critics were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=624.3s	624.3	 quick to point out that I might even be responsible for these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=627.2s	627.2	 snaps taking place. In reality, many if not most dogs will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=631.2s	631.2	 exhibit this type of behavior, especially when they're young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=634.3s	634.3	 And it is true that if unaddressed, it can take more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=637.2s	637.2	 time to resolve guarding behavior like this. But let me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=640.1s	640.1	 say that I've been so impressed with Inersha's social skills
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=644.0s	644.0	 with Veronica and the other dogs she's known throughout her life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=647.0s	647.0	 In addition to working with Veronica on her natural desire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=649.8s	649.8	 to potentially guard things, Inersha has been an ideal role
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=653.8s	653.8	 model. You don't have to share if you don't want Inersha. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=656.1s	656.1	 can tell her you're back off. I know you'll be nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo_5IXIHXo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=86&pp=iAQB&t=669.4s	669.4	 You're just gonna let her take that? You can go get it back.
