https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=3.8s	3.8	 So that's something we've got to deal with right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 Plus Biscuits needs to start learning how to pay attention to me when we walk, and when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 we start putting all of this together in the actual real world, and not just our living

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=17.5s	17.5	 When Biscuits first came to our house, she was a little bit more hesitant than not about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 interacting with Inertia, and Inertia has gone out of her way to make Biscuits more

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=34.3s	34.3	 One way that I like to temper this behavior, rather than relying on Inertia to take care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 of everything, is to make sure that I'm doing my part to give Biscuits the outlet she needs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=43.9s	43.9	 to run and bite and play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=52.3s	52.3	 Look at the different textures here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 BarkBox and SuperChewerBox are incredible monthly subscription boxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 They're magic mushrooms!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 So you can pull them apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=66.8s	66.8	 They really are magic mushrooms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=68.4s	68.4	 Alright, so she clearly likes the BarkBox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=72.3s	72.3	 What about SuperChewer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=73.3s	73.3	 SuperChewer's for those dogs who are real hard on toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 This comes off, and there's a whole new toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=78.9s	78.9	 Before, after.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 SuperChewer's for any size dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 And I know in Biscuits' case, she's definitely interested in different textures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 So this is a harder one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=88.3s	88.3	 She might be a SuperChewer dog after all!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=90.5s	90.5	 With both boxes, you get two bags of awesome treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 Bark has an insane deal right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 They're going to give you a free memory foam dog bed when you sign up for a multi-month

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=115.9s	115.9	 Love how Inersha's playing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 Very measured though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 This is all in good fun, but there are times when Biscuits' energy is a little too much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=134.8s	134.8	 even for Inersha.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 But she is still being extremely gentle here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=151.2s	151.2	 There should be no obvious intent to escalate the altercation as far as the adult dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=155.7s	155.7	 concerned.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 a place of fear or anger.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 And not all dogs do this well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=184.9s	184.9	 We always make sure that both Inersha and Biscuits have a place that they can go if

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 That's exactly what I like to see in an older dog who's interacting with a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=231.1s	231.1	 In terms of Inersha kind of giving Biscuits that correction, saying, hey, a little too

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=361.6s	361.6	 position.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=372.7s	372.7	 Let me give you an idea of what we're working towards here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=379.9s	379.9	 position.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 So I've got her in front of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 I'm going to get her into a stand trying to lure her.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=394.6s	394.6	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=398.4s	398.4	 That's okay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=403.4s	403.4	 I'm just trying to get her comfortable with this movement because it's a nice way to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=408.4s	408.4	 your dog to understand how to use their body better, which is good for future training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=412.6s	412.6	 If they're really good at walking backwards and spinning, they're going to be more agile,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=416.4s	416.4	 maybe less prone to injury if they know how to move their body very purposefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=420.2s	420.2	 See how she's starting to back up there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=421.7s	421.7	 That's pretty cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=422.7s	422.7	 And I'm constantly watching her for signs of frustration that she's becoming uninterested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=427.4s	427.4	 But so far, I'm not seeing many signs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=429.4s	429.4	 It seems like she's willingly participating and enjoying the training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=433.4s	433.4	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=443.4s	443.4	 Here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=455.4s	455.4	 that looks more like an actual heel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=464.4s	464.4	 How about that?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=472.4s	472.4	 her with the okay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=478.4s	478.4	 them to spin, it looks like at least in her case, that might be a better way to get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=483.4s	483.4	 heel a bit faster.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=487.4s	487.4	 is something that I'd like to discourage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=489.4s	489.4	 While I have her attention, I'll treat her every second or so that she holds that heel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=494.4s	494.4	 position.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=500.4s	500.4	 behavior that is keeping the heel session moving on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=503.4s	503.4	 So now I'm going to increase the criteria basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=506.4s	506.4	 I'm only going to give her a treat while she's standing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=512.4s	512.4	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=522.4s	522.4	 at some point.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=526.4s	526.4	 Here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=562.4s	562.4	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=563.4s	563.4	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=565.4s	565.4	 She's brainstorming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=568.4s	568.4	 See how she's biting herself?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=569.4s	569.4	 She could just have an itch or she could be getting a little frustrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=572.4s	572.4	 That might be my cue to give her a break or do something easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=575.4s	575.4	 But that was an incredible first session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=577.4s	577.4	 So that is the state of Biscuits' puppy heel right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=582.4s	582.4	 Biscuits has been learning how to be brave in some pretty intense places for a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=586.4s	586.4	 puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=587.4s	587.4	 But today we're going to show her some things that would give any puppy paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=590.4s	590.4	 I think she's ready though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=592.4s	592.4	 Time to find out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=593.4s	593.4	 We brought Biscuits out to this park that I really like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=597.4s	597.4	 But I'm kind of having second thoughts right now because I forget how loud the jets are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=602.4s	602.4	 that come overhead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=603.4s	603.4	 But now that we're here, I'm like, I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=605.4s	605.4	 And Bree, you know, because sounds are so important for puppies to get used to, we should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=611.4s	611.4	 like deliberately introduce a lot of sounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=613.4s	613.4	 I know it might seem trivial, but dogs often develop disproportionate responses to natural
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=618.4s	618.4	 and artificial sounds like electronic motors or vacuums or anything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=622.4s	622.4	 Training yourself to deliberately introduce things like sounds that you do have control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=627.4s	627.4	 over is likely to set your dog up for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=630.4s	630.4	 Try this on, Bree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=634.4s	634.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=636.4s	636.4	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=637.4s	637.4	 Nice calm reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=638.4s	638.4	 Love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=639.4s	639.4	 This place is famous for very loud jets flying directly above.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=642.4s	642.4	 So I'll want to do my best to give her an introduction to this type of sound, plus have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=646.4s	646.4	 a way to reduce the volume of the jet should she get nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=650.4s	650.4	 This is going to take some ingenuity on our part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=653.4s	653.4	 But it's better to do gradual introductions to things where possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=657.4s	657.4	 So that's why we're sitting here waiting for a plane to fly over so she can hear it in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=661.4s	661.4	 this more controlled setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=663.4s	663.4	 You know, I just rolled down the window there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=665.4s	665.4	 I can modify the volume of the jet flying above by changing the window.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=671.4s	671.4	 See that? Isn't that neat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=672.4s	672.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=673.4s	673.4	 So that's something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=674.4s	674.4	 And that in and of itself makes a sound and she's reacting really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=676.4s	676.4	 You can see that she's noticing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=678.4s	678.4	 It looks like our first jet is going to fly over right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=690.4s	690.4	 Have you noticed that when you're holding her and something does surprise her, you'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=694.4s	694.4	 feel her heart rate really accelerate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=695.4s	695.4	 It's a really good indicator as to her state of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=699.4s	699.4	 But here when she's sitting on me, I can still feel her muscles loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=703.4s	703.4	 Whereas if she woke up and was like, oh no, she would kind of tense up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=706.4s	706.4	 Looks good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=707.4s	707.4	 She reacted well and I think we're good to move forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=709.4s	709.4	 I still want to verify though that she isn't startled of that jet when she's outside of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=714.4s	714.4	 the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=719.4s	719.4	 Little increase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=720.4s	720.4	 It caught her attention more than it did in there, but still an acceptable reaction it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=723.4s	723.4	 looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=724.4s	724.4	 Different perspective, seeing people walk, seeing dogs from above.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=728.4s	728.4	 I'm still noticing that initial shaking, which might indicate excitement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=733.4s	733.4	 It might indicate a little nervousness, but it has been subsiding every time that we've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=738.4s	738.4	 gotten one of these training sessions underway or in this case, it's going to be a free walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=743.4s	743.4	 You think about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=744.4s	744.4	 See the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=745.4s	745.4	 There's dogs down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=747.4s	747.4	 You can see there's quite a bit of people here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=750.4s	750.4	 She's so uncertain about all of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=752.4s	752.4	 She's probably never seen a ground quite like this either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=754.4s	754.4	 Let's see what she makes of the water over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=756.4s	756.4	 What do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=757.4s	757.4	 Now these waves, certainly while small to us, must look much bigger and she's just bolting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=762.4s	762.4	 towards the water right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=763.4s	763.4	 Most likely the first time she's ever seen waves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=766.4s	766.4	 This is a weird planet, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=768.4s	768.4	 Interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=769.4s	769.4	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=770.4s	770.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=771.4s	771.4	 That's neat, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=772.4s	772.4	 You can see this is probably the most anxiety she's had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=775.4s	775.4	 So let's try and keep her under threshold here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=777.4s	777.4	 We're going to counter condition her since she's having somewhat of a fearful reaction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=782.4s	782.4	 letting her back away at will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=784.4s	784.4	 She's not like shut down fearful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=786.4s	786.4	 I think she's just more apprehensive and that would make a lot of sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=789.4s	789.4	 Not so into a toy right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=791.4s	791.4	 Where are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=792.4s	792.4	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=793.4s	793.4	 How about this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=794.4s	794.4	 I wonder if I can get her playing around the water here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=797.4s	797.4	 That's a good way to measure confidence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=799.4s	799.4	 See how she's playing right here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=800.4s	800.4	 She gets a little apprehensive when she sees one of those waves come up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=804.4s	804.4	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=806.4s	806.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=809.4s	809.4	 So I've been able to put my hand out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=812.4s	812.4	 Look at how brave she's getting for this food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=815.4s	815.4	 And I'm not making her do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=816.4s	816.4	 I'm just seeing if she'll go for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=817.4s	817.4	 And if she doesn't feel like it, that's OK too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=819.4s	819.4	 There's no reason for her to get into the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=821.4s	821.4	 I just want her being more comfortable with something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=823.4s	823.4	 and show her how to overcome something that she's a little apprehensive of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=826.4s	826.4	 Confidence building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=828.4s	828.4	 You can see she's getting more and more comfortable with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=830.4s	830.4	 This isn't like a sandy beach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=832.4s	832.4	 This is very rocky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=833.4s	833.4	 So I want to get her used to different surfaces too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=836.4s	836.4	 One of the things I just love about small dogs like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=839.4s	839.4	 it's a lot easier to ease them into the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=841.4s	841.4	 because most of them are going to feel more secure when you hold them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=844.4s	844.4	 But then, you know, once you feel they've adapted, you can put them down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=847.4s	847.4	 And we'll see if that does anything for us today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=849.4s	849.4	 Look at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=851.4s	851.4	 She's like, what is this place?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=853.4s	853.4	 Completely new type of ground for her to walk on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=856.4s	856.4	 Some of these rocks are bigger than she is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=859.4s	859.4	 So think about how a terrain like this might look from her perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=864.4s	864.4	 They look like smaller rocks to us, but her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=866.4s	866.4	 She's practically rock climbing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=868.4s	868.4	 See how she's having to learn a new way to walk there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=871.4s	871.4	 And one of the reasons we selected this place was because of the different texture of the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=875.4s	875.4	 And I'm hoping she might gain some confidence when dealing with different terrain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=880.4s	880.4	 encountering new things, new smells, new materials, all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=884.4s	884.4	 Letting your puppy naturally explore like this, new places on their own terms, can be really great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=888.4s	888.4	 I mean, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=889.4s	889.4	 Look how brave she is to just jump up on that rock and look at her going down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=894.4s	894.4	 And it's important to keep your eye out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=896.4s	896.4	 Be aware of your surroundings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=898.4s	898.4	 Make sure there aren't any other dogs that might run up to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=901.4s	901.4	 I just want her to kind of explore right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=903.4s	903.4	 Hence why she's on such a long lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=905.4s	905.4	 Here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=908.4s	908.4	 That was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=910.4s	910.4	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=912.4s	912.4	 Really key when teaching a recall is to also give them the freedom to resume doing what it is they want to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=918.4s	918.4	 Within reason, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=920.4s	920.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=922.4s	922.4	 She looked back at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=923.4s	923.4	 Just going to give her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=924.4s	924.4	 If she's responsive to it, I'll do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=926.4s	926.4	 But I'm not going to insist on training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=928.4s	928.4	 This is first and foremost a socialization outing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=932.4s	932.4	 What do you think, biscuits?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=934.4s	934.4	 Look at that boat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=935.4s	935.4	 Crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=936.4s	936.4	 Look at that big boat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=937.4s	937.4	 Now, I know that at any moment we are due for a giant jet to fly over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=942.4s	942.4	 And I'm curious to see if she continues to act well when the loud sound of the jets pass over when she is in explore mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=960.4s	960.4	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=961.4s	961.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=963.4s	963.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=964.4s	964.4	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=965.4s	965.4	 And so I've called her a total of what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=967.4s	967.4	 Three times out here while we've just been hanging out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=970.4s	970.4	 That time I was able to call her in the presence of a significant distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=974.4s	974.4	 A giant airplane flying through the sky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=976.4s	976.4	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=977.4s	977.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=979.4s	979.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=981.4s	981.4	 Well done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=982.4s	982.4	 Boy, her recall is almost 100 percent right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=985.4s	985.4	 Come and stay are two things that I really like to teach dogs when I'm first working with them because it's really important that they understand how to come to you and how to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=995.4s	995.4	 Biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=996.4s	996.4	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=997.4s	997.4	 She was doing perfect on coming back to me when I was asking for her attention a moment ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1002.4s	1002.4	 But you could see her clearly just look at these waves as they came in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1006.4s	1006.4	 And she was like, wait a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1007.4s	1007.4	 I can't focus on you when that's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1009.4s	1009.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1010.4s	1010.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1011.4s	1011.4	 I said yes because she was walking towards me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1013.4s	1013.4	 I would love to continue to support this wonderful confidence she's exhibiting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1017.4s	1017.4	 This rock is probably millions of years old and it's been waiting for this opportunity to help me teach biscuits some general body awareness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1026.4s	1026.4	 Seriously, this is actually pretty important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1028.4s	1028.4	 And I wonder if we can get her comfortable staying on this rock with all four of her paws on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1033.4s	1033.4	 For example, here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1036.4s	1036.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1037.4s	1037.4	 I'm only going to reward her from this point forward when all four paws are up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1043.4s	1043.4	 Oh, see, it's tough for her to stay up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1045.4s	1045.4	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1046.4s	1046.4	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1047.4s	1047.4	 You guessed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1048.4s	1048.4	 Rapid, small treats is what I'm giving her to convey that I want her to stay up here for a longer amount of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1053.4s	1053.4	 It seems to be working pretty well here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1055.4s	1055.4	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1056.4s	1056.4	 So I haven't really focused on formally teaching her stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1059.4s	1059.4	 I have been teaching her to hold her position when I put her into a sit and to hold her position when I put her into a down and then release her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1066.4s	1066.4	 But I also want her to understand the concept of stay in other circumstances as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1071.4s	1071.4	 Training dogs is about showing them many different contexts in which you would like them to listen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1076.4s	1076.4	 Furthermore, I'm seeing such a strong attention span from her in this new environment, which is very encouraging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1082.4s	1082.4	 Yes. And as long as she holds her four paws on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1085.4s	1085.4	 Yes. I'm going to continue to give her some of her breakfast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1088.4s	1088.4	 So I'm just using her puppy food right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1090.4s	1090.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1092.4s	1092.4	 Kind of an unconventional way of teaching stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1095.4s	1095.4	 In this case, stay means stay on this little platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1098.4s	1098.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1101.4s	1101.4	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1102.4s	1102.4	 And then, of course, I'll let her know when the stay is over there by releasing her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1106.4s	1106.4	 Got a distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1108.4s	1108.4	 How responsive will she be in the presence of dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1112.4s	1112.4	 OK. I'm going to release her from the stay since there's a dog close by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1115.4s	1115.4	 I'm going to let her now observe to be fair to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1119.4s	1119.4	 Here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1121.4s	1121.4	 So after letting her observe for a few seconds, I'm going to try to resume over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1124.4s	1124.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1127.4s	1127.4	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1130.4s	1130.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1133.4s	1133.4	 I'll admit this strategy here is a little borderline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1136.4s	1136.4	 I mean, I do want her to see and observe lots of things without asking too much of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1140.4s	1140.4	 However, she's so on right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1142.4s	1142.4	 So it seems like a good opportunity to reinforce her focused attention on me while pretty near another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1149.4s	1149.4	 That's something that's really hard for lots of dogs on this planet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1152.4s	1152.4	 Got an airplane here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1155.4s	1155.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1158.4s	1158.4	 Here. Look at me. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1161.4s	1161.4	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1166.4s	1166.4	 You may start to see why gentle, singular introductions have value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1171.4s	1171.4	 I mean, we've been letting her see dogs and nature in other lessons,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1174.4s	1174.4	 and now we have a massive jet just a few feet above us with dogs and all well-being in a brand new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1181.4s	1181.4	 You can see how we're starting to stack all of these variables on top of each other,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1185.4s	1185.4	 and Biscuit is passing the test at every turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1188.4s	1188.4	 I mean, you've got to be impressed by that focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1190.4s	1190.4	 It was hard for me not to look up at that plane passing so closely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1194.4s	1194.4	 and I even got her attention right as the plane was going by in the middle of a training session where I'm asking for a lot of focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1200.4s	1200.4	 I think we pointed out the myriad of distractions around us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1205.4s	1205.4	 And remember, socialization, probably above all, is about getting your dog to behave in an acceptable manner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1210.4s	1210.4	 Ideally, calmly and focused in new environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1213.4s	1213.4	 Not all dogs are like that, as you've seen from other videos we've made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1216.4s	1216.4	 Now, if she was overwhelmed, I would just try to make the environment less stimulating and work up to being in an environment like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1222.4s	1222.4	 In other words, I would probably go to less crowded or noisy places, like a more remote park, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1228.4s	1228.4	 and try to be very purposeful about teaching her, you know, like 20 minutes to an hour a day, a few days a week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1233.4s	1233.4	 You don't need to turn your life upside down to do this type of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1236.4s	1236.4	 I think that's the biggest misconception.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1238.4s	1238.4	 I mean, dogs can only retain so much in a day anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1240.4s	1240.4	 People think that I'm training these dogs all day long, but really I just get two or three of these training sessions in tops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1246.4s	1246.4	 Okay, I'm beginning to think that Biscuits was a gymnast in a former life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1250.4s	1250.4	 This is more than just a cute trick. I'm really impressed by this because she's having to really finally control her body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1256.4s	1256.4	 rather than just flopping around like puppies often do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1259.4s	1259.4	 I'm going to go with maybe a half spin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1261.4s	1261.4	 Good motor control like that, when they use their feet really finely and delicately, can give you a lot of options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1267.4s	1267.4	 It also teaches them how to stay safer over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1270.4s	1270.4	 Okay, serious real world test coming up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1273.4s	1273.4	 Will she pursue the other dog or will she choose to listen to me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1277.4s	1277.4	 Let's watch for tension on that leash and see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1281.4s	1281.4	 Here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1283.4s	1283.4	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1286.4s	1286.4	 Good moment right there. Real good moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1289.4s	1289.4	 Being able to call your dog away from another dog is a big deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1292.4s	1292.4	 She's learning how to use that body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1295.4s	1295.4	 Yes. Good girl. There we go. How about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1299.4s	1299.4	 She's loving exploring the world. She's listening so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1303.4s	1303.4	 Get a free memory foam bed and awesome toys and treats every month when you sign up for a bark box or a super chewer box or even both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dxXqEB_2RM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=1310.4s	1310.4	 Using my special links in the description.
