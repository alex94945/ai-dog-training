https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 More important than anything is getting to know Biscuits and socializing her and finding out how she behaves in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=5.9s	5.9	 And I've also got five things that I hope to be able to teach her today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 I'm Zach George. This is my wife, Bri, and our dog, Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=14.2s	14.2	 And this is Biscuits, the rescue dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 She's only 13 weeks old and completely untrained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=21.1s	21.1	 I teach dogs and I teach people how to teach their dogs using the most modern dog behavior science,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=26.8s	26.8	 which shows us that using frequent corrections when training our dogs only holds us back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 So I'll have to keep Biscuits loving training for maximum results in the weeks ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=36.9s	36.9	 But look, just because it's more effective doesn't mean it's magic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 And my plans don't always go as intended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 Not only does Biscuits have to learn all of her basics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=45.1s	45.1	 but she has to get properly socialized in order to be prepared for her new life ahead in this magical place known as Alaska.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=53.1s	53.1	 You're not going to want to miss a single episode.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=62.6s	62.6	 It's been 24 hours since I brought home Biscuits, the wild Alaskan rescue puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 One of the main questions that people have when they get a new dog or a new puppy is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=71.8s	71.8	 how do I keep them alive and healthy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=74.7s	74.7	 I'll tell you, from all of our research, if you want to feed your dog really fresh food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=79.2s	79.2	 forget about these one size fits all dog foods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 Few of us are nutrition experts when it comes to our dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 but with us living in the modern era, we can finally get an optimized dog food regardless of their age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 I mean, you wouldn't feed the same thing to a six pound puppy that you would to a giant Alaskan dire wolf or a lab mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=98.4s	98.4	 The most ultra premium fresh food that I know of is actually available to ship in the entire continental United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=105.7s	105.7	 But it's not like they just make a bunch of fresh food and just ship it out to dogs everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=109.6s	109.6	 Nom Nom has actual professional nutritionists who will create special recipes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 This is really precision stuff.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=148.2s	148.2	 Trinom.com slash Zach. I'm going to have that link below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=161.7s	161.7	 How about you? Are you having fun, Inersha?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 I think just letting the puppy be themselves is really important during those first many days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=168.7s	168.7	 How are her teeth sharper today than they were yesterday?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 Ouch! Seriously, I'm not even kidding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=174.5s	174.5	 Look at this monster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 Yeah, we got to work on biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=176.8s	176.8	 I think she's just getting more confident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=178.8s	178.8	 Yeah, we'll deal with that later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 Speaking of getting more confident, it's time to take Biscuits in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=184.5s	184.5	 I love to get out into the real world with a new dog in training just to get a baseline and see how they react to things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=190.8s	190.8	 For example, the wind last night alone was enough to cause her a little bit of concern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=195.2s	195.2	 So I'm wondering, is she generally noise phobic or was it something else?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=199.1s	199.1	 That's something I've got to pay attention to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 Particularly with puppies, what you see in your living room inside is not necessarily what you're going to get outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 In fact, it's almost certainly not until you socialize them and give them lots of new experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=214.4s	214.4	 I mean, think about it with a dog this young, every time they see something, hear something or smell something new,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=219.3s	219.3	 there's a very good chance that is the first time they've experienced those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 A lot of noises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=225.2s	225.2	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=226.1s	226.1	 I just rolled down my window so she can hear them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=228.6s	228.6	 That's one of the reasons we decided to come down here to downtown Anchorage to give Biscuits exposure to sounds, new experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 Did you know the number one cause of death for dogs under the age of three is behavioral problems?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 So that's another reason that prioritizing socializing is important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 Biscuits is approximately 13 weeks old right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=249.7s	249.7	 So you might be wondering how safe it is to go in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 The American Veterinary Society of Inhabitable Behavior advises that we get out there and we socialize puppies before they're fully vaccinated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 because there are so many advantages to giving dogs a variety of social experiences while they're young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=265.4s	265.4	 Provided you go out of your way to avoid places where unvaccinated dogs frequent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 Gotcha!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=270.8s	270.8	 Time to see the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=272.3s	272.3	 She doesn't know how to walk on leash yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=273.7s	273.7	 Immediately I'm noticing a little bit of like trembling out of her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 She's hearing these cars pass by, something she's clearly not very familiar with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=282.2s	282.2	 She's never been in a place like this at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=284.2s	284.2	 So this is a very extreme human environment for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 The sound of the cars going by, like there's a bus right there that's about to pass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=292.2s	292.2	 It might seem insignificant, but showing your dog things like this in a very purposeful way in the beginning can really go a long way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=299.3s	299.3	 I'm not asking her to do anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=300.6s	300.6	 The priority is letting her observe right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 This is why socializing your dog and getting out and about is actually a thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=307.4s	307.4	 It's normal for puppies to behave in a variety of different ways, including being nervous of new things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 Socializing a dog, particularly at the right age, can really be beneficial for their long-term social health.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=318.6s	318.6	 Here we have like a old school looking vehicle of some kind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 It's going to be a little bit louder than a modern vehicle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 You can see her ears noticing that sort of thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=331.3s	331.3	 It's a bit quieter over here and there's some nice grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=333.8s	333.8	 I think that Biscuits is probably ready for me to put her down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=336.8s	336.8	 Okay, she's exploring the world and she looks like she's feeling a little bit more comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=341.7s	341.7	 But I'll make sure that she knows I'm right here to reassure her if she starts feeling unsure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=346.4s	346.4	 You want me to come hang down here with you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=348.2s	348.2	 Hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=349.3s	349.3	 Look at the tail wagging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=350.4s	350.4	 She's looking pretty happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 All is well here so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=353.8s	353.8	 Usually when I do training sessions like this, I'll stay out here for like an hour just letting them check things out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=358.6s	358.6	 So look at this difference in how she's behaving right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=360.9s	360.9	 She's definitely looking more upbeat, a little bit more curious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=364.3s	364.3	 This is all very healthy stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=369.8s	369.8	 I saw her getting to the end of the leash there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=371.9s	371.9	 So I made a little kissy sound to encourage her to kind of come back over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=375.3s	375.3	 I don't want to intervene too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=376.6s	376.6	 I really just want her checking out the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=378.7s	378.7	 But I didn't want her to start pulling and lunging and experiencing anxiety over there going towards those people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=385.4s	385.4	 When a puppy like this is brand new to a leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 they can also become more anxious when they feel the tension on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=391.4s	391.4	 So I'm trying to avoid that in excess here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=393.8s	393.8	 So there's tension there and I can pull like that and she's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=401.2s	401.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=402.6s	402.6	 And so she's really taken to that ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=404.6s	404.6	 That's good. I'm trying to reinforce her when she comes back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 Let her know coming back to me is going to be a fun time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=413.8s	413.8	 Good. But it's not about me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=416.2s	416.2	 It's about experiencing the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=419.0s	419.0	 More of that later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=421.4s	421.4	 This is really good. I like how she's being nice and calm here while checking the world out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=426.5s	426.5	 Now, you know how much I like to play frisbee with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=429.4s	429.4	 So with her being this size, obviously, I can't do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=433.8s	433.8	 Or can I?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=435.1s	435.1	 Uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=436.1s	436.1	 Zach George finds a way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=438.4s	438.4	 This is the first time she's ever seen a disc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=440.3s	440.3	 I'd say we're off to a good start here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=443.7s	443.7	 Good. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=444.8s	444.8	 Good girl. I'm playing a little bit of tug of war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=447.4s	447.4	 I want to be mindful of those puppy teeth, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=449.6s	449.6	 Once you've got them interested in frisbee, I like to teach them how to take it by the rim.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=454.4s	454.4	 Get it just like that. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=457.1s	457.1	 Give my little tug to reinforce it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=459.2s	459.2	 Let her walk around with it for a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=461.5s	461.5	 Watch this. Let's roll it around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=463.5s	463.5	 See that? Love the turn towards me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=466.2s	466.2	 Not going to take it from her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=467.8s	467.8	 I want her to feel comfortable coming back to me with the items, so I don't want to just steal it from her every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=473.4s	473.4	 But when she does let go like that, she's going to roll it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=476.4s	476.4	 And so as she stops here to look around, the priority is not teaching her how to play frisbee right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=480.9s	480.9	 The priority is to let her explore the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=483.0s	483.0	 So she got distracted right there. I'm not going to redirect her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=485.6s	485.6	 The whole reason I started frisbee is because she seemed to be playful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=489.2s	489.2	 Now she's back into sniffy mode and checking out the environment mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 So I want to encourage that as much as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=495.6s	495.6	 Do your best to find the balance between interacting with your dog and letting them do their own thing and take the world in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=501.4s	501.4	 This is something you'll learn to do really well with your dog as you get to know them better and better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=505.8s	505.8	 Feel that tempo out with your individual dog. Every dog is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=509.6s	509.6	 There it is. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=511.2s	511.2	 We roll it like that to teach them how to grab it by the rim while it's rolling or while it's in motion, I should say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=517.3s	517.3	 Look at that. You see how she's going for the rim?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=519.6s	519.6	 Boom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=524.4s	524.4	 See how she noticed the audio?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=525.9s	525.9	 Not distracted by it. Look at all around. Look at the ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=529.0s	529.0	 Look how she's looking behind her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=531.6s	531.6	 It's like going in and out because she's remembering, oh, yeah, what is this place that I'm in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=535.4s	535.4	 I assume I don't know what she's thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=537.0s	537.0	 I basically want her doing whatever she wants within reason for this particular lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=542.6s	542.6	 So what does a 13 week old mixed breed Alaskan village dog like to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=549.9s	549.9	 You know, something tells me I'm going to have that question thoroughly answered over the next few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=556.6s	556.6	 Good girl. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=558.8s	558.8	 Biscuits is starting to come out of her shell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=560.6s	560.6	 Her playful personality is showing even out here in this new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=564.1s	564.1	 But you can see she still gets thrown off by loud sounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=567.2s	567.2	 Listen to the jet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=568.5s	568.5	 That's something I want to focus on now and probably more a bit later on in this series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=573.2s	573.2	 I think in this case, one of the best things I can do is pair some type of fun play session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=579.0s	579.0	 with things that cause her to be a bit skeptical or even nervous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=582.9s	582.9	 The more I can keep things upbeat for her and keep her in a positive frame of mind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=586.2s	586.2	 the more likely it is she'll become less nervous in these situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=589.6s	589.6	 There's so much give and take when you're training dogs, especially puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=593.4s	593.4	 As you can see, she's getting a little antsy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=595.0s	595.0	 She wants to go smell those flowers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=596.2s	596.2	 I'm going to let her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=597.0s	597.0	 Because the dog is small doesn't mean that we just simply pull them along because we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=601.2s	601.2	 It's important to teach them how to think autonomously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=604.4s	604.4	 Good job, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=606.6s	606.6	 See how she's trying to get play. All right, that's frustration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=610.4s	610.4	 What's this? Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=612.5s	612.5	 Very good. You want to play? Good. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=616.2s	616.2	 And just by virtue of getting out of the house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=618.1s	618.1	 you're going to give your dog so many unintended experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=621.8s	621.8	 Usually that will work to your benefit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=624.0s	624.0	 I'm going to let her go to the camera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=625.7s	625.7	 You can see she wants to say hi to Bree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=628.4s	628.4	 Bree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=630.2s	630.2	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=631.2s	631.2	 Periodically, I'll also reinforce her paying attention to me, coming to me with treats and toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=636.3s	636.3	 See, we've got a group of people gathered on the steps over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=639.0s	639.0	 Yes. I like how she looked at those people nice and calmly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=642.4s	642.4	 So far, I'm pretty happy that she's not showing excessive frustration being on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=648.0s	648.0	 And that might be due in part to the fact that we've been very delicate about introducing it over the last day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=653.9s	653.9	 To reiterate this point, because it's counterintuitive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=656.8s	656.8	 when you go slow when training your dog, you're probably more likely to get faster results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=662.9s	662.9	 And look, it's not always practical to manage the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=665.6s	665.6	 I mean, planes can come by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=667.3s	667.3	 And if your dog is nervous of loud sounds, then what do you do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=671.2s	671.2	 I mean, you can't make the plane go away. It's not always easy to get away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=674.0s	674.0	 Sometimes you can prepare for an event. And a lot of times you can't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=677.6s	677.6	 I mean, that's reality dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=679.4s	679.4	 But you do your best to set your dog up for success in a broad variety of situations to give yourself and your dog an edge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=686.2s	686.2	 Some people are coming up here and she decided to get some safe space under my legs here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=690.6s	690.6	 You can really see her using her nose to try and gather more information about those people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=694.8s	694.8	 And again, since we're being patient here and we're not rushing her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=697.9s	697.9	 she has a chance to really see that they're not scary at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=701.0s	701.0	 I call that a good experience for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=703.1s	703.1	 I'm remembering again how it feels to bring a brand new puppy in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=707.3s	707.3	 Like every second you've got to be focused on what they're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=710.8s	710.8	 Now, look, did you see that? That was a leash correction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=713.0s	713.0	 That's what I'm trying to avoid when training her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=715.1s	715.1	 She picked that up. I didn't see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=716.8s	716.8	 I did a poor job of managing, which I can't be perfect and nobody can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=720.2s	720.2	 And then I had to pull her away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=721.9s	721.9	 And so now she's going to associate a punishment with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=724.9s	724.9	 And if I have too many of those, I fear that it could work against me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=728.7s	728.7	 So I want to keep those to a minimum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=732.2s	732.2	 Yes, there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=733.8s	733.8	 So that's kind of what I ideally would like to do when she becomes distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=737.5s	737.5	 Get her on a toy. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=739.8s	739.8	 I only make that point because it's not ideal for teaching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=743.6s	743.6	 If you have to pull your dog away from something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=745.5s	745.5	 you really want them to originate how to behave from the inside outward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=749.0s	749.0	 rather than having to be physically coaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=751.2s	751.2	 And with a small dog like this, it's so much easier to pull them away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=754.0s	754.0	 I would advise not falling into that trap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=756.0s	756.0	 I mean, I'm trying to treat her just as I taught Chop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=759.2s	759.2	 I mean, I still carry her. I don't think I ever carried Chop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=761.5s	761.5	 But for the most part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=762.5s	762.5	 Good girl. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=766.6s	766.6	 Did you see how she perked up when I said yes right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=768.8s	768.8	 Why did I switch to food from the toy? Anyone know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=771.7s	771.7	 I felt like I saw her start to get excited about those people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=774.6s	774.6	 And I was like, well, you know, if she's receptive to it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=776.9s	776.9	 I'd like to reinforce her with a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=779.8s	779.8	 because she's more likely to be calm than hyper in that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=782.9s	782.9	 So like knowing how to balance those things can be helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=786.1s	786.1	 Currencies have all sorts of pros and cons. Sirens are coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=789.8s	789.8	 I'm just going to let her experience it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=791.2s	791.2	 She doesn't look fearful if she wants to lean on me or seek security, she can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=796.4s	796.4	 I mean, she's probably never heard anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=798.0s	798.0	 Good girl. Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=801.0s	801.0	 You want this or not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=803.4s	803.4	 It's getting louder again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=809.7s	809.7	 Yes. I know, isn't that neat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=813.9s	813.9	 Since she's taking treats here, that indicates that she's pretty comfortable to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=818.8s	818.8	 Now, I've got some big plans for her first formal training session later today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=822.8s	822.8	 She doesn't know how to do anything at all,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=824.6s	824.6	 and I'm hoping to teach her like five things at least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=827.9s	827.9	 Training a dog isn't just about teaching them how to sit and stay calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=832.1s	832.1	 When we commit to having a dog in our life,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=833.9s	833.9	 it's our job to prepare them for this big world that they've been born into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=838.6s	838.6	 The more confident a dog feels in their environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=840.4s	840.4	 I think the more likely they are to behave as we want them to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=844.0s	844.0	 It looks like you really want to hold her. I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=845.6s	845.6	 I know. There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=846.8s	846.8	 All right, I'm done shooting this video now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=848.4s	848.4	 I really feel like we are starting to get to know the real biscuits now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=852.6s	852.6	 And I still haven't forgotten that I intend to teach her five new things today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=857.6s	857.6	 I don't know why I set myself up for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=859.3s	859.3	 I mean, that is a lot of things for a puppy to learn in one day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=862.7s	862.7	 I'm going to start with sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=864.0s	864.0	 So when I'm teaching her sit, I'm kind of focused on luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=867.7s	867.7	 Luring a dog is where you use something that they're very interested in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=872.0s	872.0	 usually some type of food, though it can be a toy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=874.6s	874.6	 in order to keep their attention so that you can help them achieve a specific physical position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=880.4s	880.4	 like sit, lie down, roll over or play dead even.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=883.2s	883.2	 I'm just using her nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=884.5s	884.5	 See how easy it is to lure her around?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=887.0s	887.0	 She's really responsive to the lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=889.5s	889.5	 Yes. The second her butt touches the ground, I'm going to say yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=892.8s	892.8	 OK, I'm going to release her from the sit by saying OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=896.4s	896.4	 She'll understand what OK means in time as she experiences it contextually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=902.1s	902.1	 Yes. While she's here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=904.0s	904.0	 Yes, I'm going to reward her also for holding that sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=907.6s	907.6	 So I'm doing a lot of little different things, just trying to feel her out a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=910.8s	910.8	 And usually when we're luring a dog like this, this is something we do in the beginning just to really help them understand what we're going for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=917.9s	917.9	 But the emphasis should in the medium term future be on phasing out that lure and converting that into a hand signal or a spoken request.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=926.1s	926.1	 It's more like teaching leave it now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=927.8s	927.8	 For this lesson, I'm going to switch to something pretty irresistible so that I can teach her to resist it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=935.2s	935.2	 I'm always up for a challenge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=936.6s	936.6	 Oh, boy, what is this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=939.0s	939.0	 You're an Alaskan dog. You're going to like these salmon treats with biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=942.7s	942.7	 I thought we might go about teaching her how to leave a treat alone in a different way than I've done it in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=948.6s	948.6	 See, traditionally, I'll cover up the treat and discourage her from going after the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=953.2s	953.2	 But this time, I want to catch her succeeding without even having to cover up the treat at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=957.8s	957.8	 I mean, you know, if you're going to teach with reinforcement training, you have to really look for opportunities to reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=963.2s	963.2	 Yes. See how she's looking to me when I'm presenting that distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=968.4s	968.4	 Yes. You're seeing that I'm giving her a lot of treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=971.2s	971.2	 These are some of my favorite training treats ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=973.6s	973.6	 Particularly, I use the freeze dried meat ones all the time for primary training sessions like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=978.6s	978.6	 And then for more casual training, I'll often use the sweet potato treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=982.0s	982.0	 And remember, you don't always have to use treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=984.4s	984.4	 But in the beginning, we have to get that behaviors established.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=987.3s	987.3	 So we reinforce a lot. Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=989.8s	989.8	 Yes. As she leaves it, I'm saying leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=991.9s	991.9	 That was a clear example right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=993.9s	993.9	 If you're working on skills like this with your dogs, you need to check out my totally free digital dog training course, 30 Day Perfect Pup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1000.8s	1000.8	 I'm going to have a link in the description where you can sign up for this course and you can also check out Pupford's amazing training treats, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1006.8s	1006.8	 Leave it. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1009.5s	1009.5	 See how she corrected herself there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1011.2s	1011.2	 So really good place to stop on leave it for now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1013.5s	1013.5	 I'll come back to this and try and make it more and more challenging for her as her skills develop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1018.5s	1018.5	 We want to be able to get our dog's attention on us when we ask for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1021.8s	1021.8	 Lately, I've been using the term here to mean look at me, but we have to teach her what that means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1027.1s	1027.1	 Yes. I'm going to reward her for the sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1029.4s	1029.4	 You might notice the hand signal there that I'm using just holding my hand up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1032.7s	1032.7	 Let's make this easy. So I'm just holding a treat up to my eyes here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1036.4s	1036.4	 Yes. Just to get her looking at my head here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1040.0s	1040.0	 Yes. If she jumps, I'll pull the treat away so that she knows that doesn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1044.8s	1044.8	 But that's still not exactly the most ideal way to go here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1047.8s	1047.8	 I should find ways to catch her succeeding before that happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1051.2s	1051.2	 And I want to avoid having to pull the treat away as much as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1054.3s	1054.3	 Not because I'm a snowflake, but because that can often lead to frustration with many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1059.1s	1059.1	 And I'll make much faster progress if I can keep her in the most optimistic mindset possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1065.1s	1065.1	 Yes. Just looking at my finger already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1067.5s	1067.5	 In other words, I'm not even having to hold up a treat here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1069.7s	1069.7	 Wow. Biscuits is on a roll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1071.9s	1071.9	 I think I can start teaching her the word here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1075.0s	1075.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1078.5s	1078.5	 Here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1080.7s	1080.7	 Getting more sustained eye contact now here using the word,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1084.8s	1084.8	 waiting a second, then saying yes, then rewarding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1088.5s	1088.5	 Yes. See that? You see how she she's kind of figured out that I've got some treats over here in this hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1093.9s	1093.9	 But then she looks directly into my eyes here because she knows that's not going to work for her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1097.8s	1097.8	 because that's not what's been reinforced. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1099.7s	1099.7	 Let me see if I can do it without a hand signal for good measure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1102.4s	1102.4	 She's giving it to me automatically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1106.6s	1106.6	 Yes. I think that Biscuits is really starting to make the connection that looking into my eyes could get her that treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1113.0s	1113.0	 So rather than asking her to look at me over and over again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1116.9s	1116.9	 I want to wait and see if she'll do it on her own. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1121.4s	1121.4	 By the way, notice she's not being restrained in any way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1123.5s	1123.5	 She's free to opt out if she gets bored or saturated or feels overwhelmed, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1128.2s	1128.2	 So I'm looking for those body language cues as I go here with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1132.0s	1132.0	 Yes. I saw her getting a little distracted, so I intervene there just to kind of give her a nudge in the right direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1138.5s	1138.5	 By making a sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1140.2s	1140.2	 I went, yes. So we've done sit, we've done leave it, we've done look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1144.1s	1144.1	 I mean, we're making great time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1145.5s	1145.5	 I think that when you're keeping things upbeat like this and you're making it a game and you're making it fun,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1150.5s	1150.5	 I mean, you're essentially paying them to learn. You're reinforcing the behaviors you like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1154.1s	1154.1	 They're much more likely to stick with these training sessions for a bit longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1157.4s	1157.4	 So lie down. Sometimes with tiny dogs can be a little challenging because they're already so close to the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1163.3s	1163.3	 They're like, what's the point?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1164.8s	1164.8	 But in the same way that we taught, said I'm going to try a lure training in her case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1169.7s	1169.7	 See how I'm letting her nibble on the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1171.4s	1171.4	 I'm giving her little fragments and crumbs of the treat as she sticks with it and lowers her head there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1176.7s	1176.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1177.5s	1177.5	 Want to acknowledge every little step she takes in the right direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1181.7s	1181.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1183.2s	1183.2	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1184.4s	1184.4	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1186.0s	1186.0	 Come on. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1188.3s	1188.3	 So she's really starting to respond to that OK as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1191.0s	1191.0	 And I want to catch her staying so I can also release her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1195.0s	1195.0	 So when we talk about positive reinforcement training, requiring you, yes, to look at things differently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1200.4s	1200.4	 that's kind of what we mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1202.0s	1202.0	 Don't wait for them to mess up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1203.4s	1203.4	 Tell them when they're succeeding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1204.7s	1204.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1207.1s	1207.1	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1208.4s	1208.4	 See, I could have easily kept her down there for 30 seconds and then she would have gotten up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1212.3s	1212.3	 I wouldn't have released her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1214.1s	1214.1	 I just want to have really clear communication with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1216.6s	1216.6	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1217.4s	1217.4	 Something different is happening this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1219.9s	1219.9	 Can you see what it is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1222.3s	1222.3	 Didn't reward on sit that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1223.8s	1223.8	 So it's already starting to phase out some rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1226.0s	1226.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1226.7s	1226.7	 After your dog starts to understand the concepts, you treat them less and less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1230.9s	1230.9	 Sometimes you go back and start treating them a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1233.6s	1233.6	 If you have relapses, but you gradually phase out treats by randomly finding ways to reinforce as the behaviors become more established.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1242.2s	1242.2	 Traditional luring with lie down is working quite well with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1245.2s	1245.2	 But another way with some dogs, if you're having trouble with this, rather than the traditional line this way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1250.9s	1250.9	 we'll focus on going this way, inward slant and see if that puts her into a down too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1257.4s	1257.4	 That often works. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1258.7s	1258.7	 See, just like that. Isn't that interesting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1260.8s	1260.8	 So get creative with your lures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1262.0s	1262.0	 Try not to be too methodical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1264.0s	1264.0	 Be willing to experiment a little bit with your individual dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1267.2s	1267.2	 Let me not use a food lure this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1269.3s	1269.3	 Let me just fake her out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1270.3s	1270.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1271.2s	1271.2	 And that's one of the ways we start phasing out the lure into a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1275.1s	1275.1	 So, I mean, I'm letting her just nibble on these crumbs in my hand because to her, that's a real treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1279.8s	1279.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1281.4s	1281.4	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1282.0s	1282.0	 And so when she does hit that position, she gets a little bit of a bigger reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1285.7s	1285.7	 Sometimes people will say, oh, my dog's not interested in treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1289.0s	1289.0	 So how do you train without treats?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1291.0s	1291.0	 Food isn't the only thing you can use to reinforce behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1294.2s	1294.2	 Biscuits also likes toys a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1296.1s	1296.1	 It's always a good reminder that we don't get to choose what our dog's favorite currency is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1300.4s	1300.4	 Our dog does.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1305.7s	1305.7	 So if you have a dog who loves treats at home, but then you take them out to the park, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1309.9s	1309.9	 and they don't take the treats, it's probably not about the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1312.4s	1312.4	 It's probably about the environment that you're asking them to listen in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1315.4s	1315.4	 So you want to focus on less distracting environments like your front yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1319.5s	1319.5	 That's kind of a compromise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1320.6s	1320.6	 You know, you're still at home, but you're outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1323.4s	1323.4	 There are definitely dogs who like treats more than other dogs, but don't assume necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1329.1s	1329.1	 that your dog doesn't like treats just because they're not taking them in all environments yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1333.8s	1333.8	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1334.4s	1334.4	 I wouldn't overlook stand if I were you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1336.7s	1336.7	 It's an easy one to teach, especially if you teach it like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1339.5s	1339.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1340.3s	1340.3	 I'm watching these paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1342.3s	1342.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1345.4s	1345.4	 Oops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1345.8s	1345.8	 If I keep doing that, like I'll do this for example sake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1349.1s	1349.1	 If I do this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1352.2s	1352.2	 I mean, probably frustrated instantly is what that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1355.5s	1355.5	 I'm trying to minimize those instances, if at all possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1358.4s	1358.4	 Same concept here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1359.3s	1359.3	 I'm trying to catch her staying for microseconds at a time and to build on top of that in relatively short order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1365.2s	1365.2	 Stay is a lot deeper than just holding position while in a sit or down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1369.9s	1369.9	 OK, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1371.2s	1371.2	 Let her know that stand stay is over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1373.6s	1373.6	 It's a broad reaching concept that applies in many different contexts when your dog sees a distraction, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1380.5s	1380.5	 Or if you're teaching them an intricate trick, you may want to throw in a stay right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1385.4s	1385.4	 So there's many ways to use stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1387.3s	1387.3	 She's starting to get the concept of stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1389.2s	1389.2	 Look at me, sit, lie down and stand already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1393.1s	1393.1	 But there's one extremely important part of a puppy's day that's been blatantly left out of this episode so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1399.1s	1399.1	 Where are we going with this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1399.9s	1399.9	 Well, the potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1402.2s	1402.2	 We just, yeah, there's a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1403.9s	1403.9	 I remember yesterday saying it's not a matter of this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1407.0s	1407.0	 It's a matter of how many or when the potty accidents will occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1410.4s	1410.4	 And in my mind, I'm thinking I'm going to keep it probably to single digits over the whole, like, series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1415.5s	1415.5	 But it's been many, many months since I last had a puppy live with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1419.3s	1419.3	 And I've been reminded of how optimistic that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1422.2s	1422.2	 As you're going to see in our next episode, raising a puppy has all kinds of challenges and things definitely don't always go exactly as you want them to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1430.6s	1430.6	 I'm hoping to learn more about Biscuit's resource guarding issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1433.8s	1433.8	 I'm going to continue to give her more exposure to public life and what the real world is like outside of our living room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1440.2s	1440.2	 And this whole potty training thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1441.9s	1441.9	 Yeah, it's already starting to drive me crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1443.9s	1443.9	 I really need to get on track here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1446.0s	1446.0	 I go and do a ton of detail on not only potty training, but everything else you could want to know about raising your new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1452.0s	1452.0	 In both of my books, Dog Training Revolution and Guide to a Well Behaved Dog, I recommend you pick both of those up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1457.6s	1457.6	 Seriously, give Nom Nom Dog Food a chance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz8u9n83Qg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=1460.0s	1460.0	 Go to Trinom.com slash Zach to get half off a two week trial to see if it's right for you and your dog.
