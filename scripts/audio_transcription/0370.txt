https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today's video is sponsored by Modern Puppies. If you have a puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=3.5s	3.5	 there's no doubt the potty training is way at the top of your list. Modern Puppies has come up with a really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 innovative way to help out with the potty training process. This is exactly what you need, Argyle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=13.9s	13.9	 This is the potty training puppy apartment, and it's literally a crate with two separate rooms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 So on this side you have a bedroom for your dog, and on this side you have a potty area for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=24.7s	24.7	 Let's get Argyle comfortable with going in and out of the puppy apartment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=28.1s	28.1	 The logic is that as your dog starts to associate this area with their bedroom,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 they're unlikely to go potty over here, and then they'll go over here to do their business, since many dogs naturally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 avoid going potty directly where they sleep. So it's great for times when you can't directly supervise your dog or let them out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=45.6s	45.6	 This isn't just for puppies either. You can use this for adult dogs who are being potty trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=49.5s	49.5	 Another way to use this too is as an alternative bathroom for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=53.4s	53.4	 So for times when the weather is really bad,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=55.8s	55.8	 you'll have a different place for them to go. The potty training puppy apartment comes in many sizes to fit all types of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 You can get the potty training puppy apartment at modernpuppies.com.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=79.4s	79.4	 I'll share some of my favorites.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=85.2s	85.2	 it's easy to feel overwhelmed, especially if you have a puppy like Argyle who's just about four months old or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=90.2s	90.2	 But today we're gonna cover some things that you can do to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=93.4s	93.4	 dramatically accelerate your puppy or dog's training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=96.8s	96.8	 Number one, show your dog the world often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=100.5s	100.5	 In other words, training can't just be limited to your living room, inside your house, or even your yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 It's vital to set aside time to give your dog plenty of field trips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=109.5s	109.5	 And it won't be realistic to get your dog to listen to you everywhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 if they're not first familiar with everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 Particularly in the beginning, set aside time to take your dog to nearby parks, new parts of the neighborhood,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=121.3s	121.3	 friends houses, and any other places you can think of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 If you have weekends off, be sure to dedicate a large portion of that time to going to new stimulating places with your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 especially during their first year of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 Until your dog gets ample exposure to the world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 it's not realistic to expect them to generalize ideal behavior in these places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=141.4s	141.4	 Trust me, the more that you make this a priority, the smoother your training is gonna be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=146.5s	146.5	 And that's what we want, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=148.7s	148.7	 Second, understand that all training needs context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 But what do I mean by that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 Teaching a dog how to listen contextually requires tons of repetition and lots of varied training circumstances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=160.8s	160.8	 So while your initial training is probably done in a distraction-free setting like your house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=165.1s	165.1	 for example, when you have your dog stay before you give them their meal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=168.5s	168.5	 you'll want to then focus on quickly varying the context in which you ask your dog to do things, like stay in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 For example, practice randomly asking for their attention when they're not expecting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 Hey!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=183.9s	183.9	 Yes! Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=185.1s	185.1	 So right there, it was a little tough to get his attention because he was focused on something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 But I stuck with him and I just kind of waited for him to look back at me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 and I was right there to reinforce him with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 In other words, to let him know that when you pay attention to me, even when you're not expecting it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=200.1s	200.1	 I'm going to make sure that I make your life great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=202.9s	202.9	 That's what you've got to get in the habit of doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 You can't just limit your training to these dedicated 5 and 10 minute sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=209.2s	209.2	 If you get really good at getting your dog's attention on you whenever you ask for it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 you'll be able to teach them just about anything and get them to listen to you almost all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=218.4s	218.4	 But it takes practice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=219.7s	219.7	 Teaching things like sit, stay in this environment is going to be a lot more challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=224.1s	224.1	 So you've got to do this a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 You'll want to do lots of training sessions each and every week during that first year of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=230.7s	230.7	 For example, when you have guests over, you'll want to practice sit and stay and look at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=235.2s	235.2	 because that's a major variable change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=237.8s	237.8	 And anytime you change a variable with a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=240.4s	240.4	 you always want to keep in mind that that makes it a little bit more challenging for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 In other words, teaching your dog stay one way doesn't equal stay all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 How do you do that with your legs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=251.9s	251.9	 That's really cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 If you find your training is looking too familiar all of the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=256.3s	256.3	 that's your cue to start mixing things up a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=259.4s	259.4	 So make sure you get to those public places and start training your dog how to do all of their basics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 It's important that you do these training sessions spontaneously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=267.8s	267.8	 I mean, at least as far as your dog is concerned anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=270.5s	270.5	 As you get good at getting your dog to take direction from you on a moment's notice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 when they're not expecting it during these set up training sessions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=277.6s	277.6	 you're increasing the likelihood that they're going to listen to you when it really counts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=280.9s	280.9	 when you actually are surprised.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 So set up lots of training sessions that really mimic real life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=286.6s	286.6	 What I'm saying is be unpredictable with your training after your dog has initial progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 This is a huge one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 Be tolerant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=294.6s	294.6	 I admit this is easier said than done, particularly with young dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 If you have a new dog or you've decided that you want to train them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=301.9s	301.9	 keep in mind things like crying throughout the night or play biting or potty accidents are virtually guaranteed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=308.6s	308.6	 The best teachers are the ones who are very consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=311.7s	311.7	 So just implement what we cover on my YouTube series very often for your general training and you'll be in good shape.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=317.8s	317.8	 Understand that it often takes weeks to months to get these habits under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=322.1s	322.1	 I can totally see why there's some confusion with this because when we teach our dogs basic concepts like sit or lie down or stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 most dogs will really pick up on those concepts within just a few training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=333.6s	333.6	 When it comes to things like jumping, play biting or house training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=336.3s	336.3	 these issues can take considerably more time to resolve than those basic obedience things that you work on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=341.6s	341.6	 It's not intuitive for dogs to just calm down when they're excited or not use their mouth to interact with anything and everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=349.2s	349.2	 That's because behaviors like this are natural and instinctive for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 In other words, they're a lot less voluntary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=355.4s	355.4	 Being aware of this and really exercising tolerance will propel your training success faster than you might have imagined.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=362.7s	362.7	 By the way, have you noticed how good our guy was being right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=365.4s	365.4	 He's been lying down and staying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O8CKTNPg2Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=371&pp=iAQB&t=367.0s	367.0	 I'm going to go ahead and give him a treat there.
