https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=45.4s	45.4	 the puppy. Here we go. We're filming a YouTube video. Do you mind if we...no, no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=49.9s	49.9	 do you mind if we get a shot of you petting her? All right, cool. Thank you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=64.8s	64.8	 that was awesome. And now she's back on the rocks so back to training. You want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 this? Yes. Good job. I'm just trying to judge right now if she's receptive to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 getting treats or if she's overstimulated by her environment and looks like she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=76.4s	76.4	 very stimulated by her environment so I'm gonna let her just exist but try to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 keep her from eating rocks. Now I'm using some baked chicken breast here just to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 see how she does and she's a little more responsive to that so I'll try and do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=87.1s	87.1	 some conditioning using this. At some point I'd like to be able to sit up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=90.6s	90.6	 and have some dinner. I think it'll be a good idea to have her go and settle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=93.6s	93.6	 down somewhere around here while I'm sitting here so we're gonna give it a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 might perceive that. Hearing people talking in the background. We have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=104.7s	104.7	 loud fan on over here. There's so much going on everywhere you take your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 and this is the first time she's been in a place like this. Okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=113.2s	113.2	 So she's just in and out for treats. Well I guess at this point since she won't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=116.7s	116.7	 take treats I'm just going to let her sniff and explore while keeping her on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 pretty short leash. So Inersha has wandered over here. I was hoping she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 would be more comfortable over here but it looks like she likes lying on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=127.4s	127.4	 rocks and as long as she's not eating rocks I'm gonna go ahead and give her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=130.6s	130.6	 some feedback here and let her know not eating rocks equals good treats now that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 she's receptive to taking treats again. It's normal for your dog to get in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 out of treat mode especially when there are new places. So we have this cooling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 mat we decided to put that out. So far it's working pretty well. Inersha seems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 to be getting a bit more comfortable and relaxed in public. In order to keep her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=150.2s	150.2	 even more preoccupied we've come prepared so we've got a little piggy or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 chew toy and we have a toy for her to play with. Hopefully that'll be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 interesting than the rocks. So far our strategy has worked really well. I might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 occasionally just go ahead and click her and give her a reward now that she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=164.8s	164.8	 calmed down naturally. When you catch your dog doing stuff you like naturally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 it's very valuable to let them know that's cool keep doing that. Station 6

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 old and one day today we have Inersha's friend Ruthie, a pug from her training

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=196.9s	196.9	 still kind of small though she's growing like five pounds a day I swear. I played

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 see right here and that's from a moment ago just playing fetch with her she's

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=224.8s	224.8	 Ruthie. Ruthie is going to play with Inersha but before I bring Inersha we're

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 in the studio let me go get Inersha and let's let them play. Say hi.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=782.7s	782.7	 I want her to learn how to behave acceptably in social settings so I'll be keeping her on leash and discouraging any dog to dog contact on this particular gathering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=792.7s	792.7	 She's had plenty of that today. You can see she's a little cautious lagging behind here but that's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=797.4s	797.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=799.4s	799.4	 Her body language has completely changed now. She looks a lot more confident, a lot more comfortable now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=804.4s	804.4	 Pick her like this. There we go. You got her? She might get you though. She's a little nippy still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=810.4s	810.4	 Alright there you go. I think she's good now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=813.4s	813.4	 This is a dog friendly snowball right here so she's enjoying it. I'm going to let her get pet as she enjoys this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=823.4s	823.4	 I don't know what she likes more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=826.2s	826.2	 Snowball reading pet. Thank you. I appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=830.2s	830.2	 Great experience. Lots of kids, lots of people, good exposure to new sounds like this air conditioning back here. New smells, just new everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=838.2s	838.2	 You might be noticing a pattern here. Lots of people, lots of places, lots of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=844.2s	844.2	 Our close friend Dr. Abbey has a couple of pets that I think Inertia needs to meet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=849.2s	849.2	 She's likely to be a little standoffish at first and then she's warmed up to every dog we've introduced her to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=853.9s	853.9	 Aww look at that. He looks very docile.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=857.9s	857.9	 Her body language is great. She's wagging the tail. She seems like she really wants to play with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=861.9s	861.9	 This is today's socialization session with Satchmo, the Irish wolf hound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=866.9s	866.9	 I'm curious to see if they start playing or you know maybe they're just pretty chill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=870.9s	870.9	 Oh my, what am I looking at?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=873.9s	873.9	 I've seen Satchmo a million times but every time I see him I just can't believe how big this dog is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=879.6s	879.6	 Inertia's like, forget this, I am out. Maybe she'll feel more comfortable playing with him inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=888.6s	888.6	 Oh wow, that's so fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=891.6s	891.6	 You know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=904.6s	904.6	 It's okay, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=907.3s	907.3	 It's okay, he's just playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=913.3s	913.3	 This is where she's like, I want to play but I'm a little unsure but I want to get out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=918.3s	918.3	 But he's so big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=920.3s	920.3	 So she's trying to initiate play?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=925.3s	925.3	 While Inertia was hiding from Satchmo, she found Remy the cat. Maybe Remy will be more welcoming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=932.3s	932.3	 Oh there we go, nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=934.0s	934.0	 Measured corrections like this from dogs, cats and other animals are ideal for puppies so that they learn that they can't just do whatever they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=943.0s	943.0	 Okay, back to Satchmo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=948.0s	948.0	 When he's a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=954.0s	954.0	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=964.0s	964.0	 But let's see how she rebounds, let's see how she recovers. I think she's got a solid recovery here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=969.0s	969.0	 That's what you want to watch right after these. Like, does she keep playing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=973.0s	973.0	 Because she's still, it looks like she's trying to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=977.0s	977.0	 Okay, so now she's a bit in the tail between the legs, she got a little fearful there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=982.0s	982.0	 So we'll give him a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=984.8s	984.8	 And see the barking, are you guys okay with the barking? It's okay with me because it's a new event for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=997.8s	997.8	 Inertia doesn't seem like she's quite ready for Satchmo just yet, so we'll let them try again in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1004.8s	1004.8	 It is week two of our puppy class here at the Louisiana SPCA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1008.5s	1008.5	 This class is really heavily focused on socializing for puppies and I've been doing so much socializing with Inertia over the last week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1015.5s	1015.5	 I'm real curious to see how she does today. And as a side note, well we've got some incredible weather coming through over the next few days, a tropical storm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1023.5s	1023.5	 This class is extra small because the news has told everyone to stay home. But nothing will keep Inertia and Luca from having some fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1031.5s	1031.5	 Yes, good girl. Since Inertia is behaving more calmly, I'm going to make sure I reinforce that, give her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1037.2s	1037.2	 A little mounting. She's taking it pretty well though, so I kind of like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1046.2s	1046.2	 Inertia is so much more comfortable playing this week than last week, so that's pretty encouraging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1051.2s	1051.2	 So that's what you do when puppies start playing a little too rough, you break it up a little bit and give them a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1056.2s	1056.2	 Down, yes, good job. And will you give me a, can you give me a sit? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1062.9s	1062.9	 So you know, after that exercise, after playing with Luca over here, she's gotten it out of her system a bit, she's a little bit more focused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1069.9s	1069.9	 So it's important not to give up. Just because your dog is unfocused, you have to let them adjust. Sometimes that takes 20, 30 minutes. In this case, it's been 30 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1077.9s	1077.9	 I'd say Inertia did really well today. She was very distracted during class because there was obviously another dog present. But that's what we expect, that's all very normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1086.9s	1086.9	 So the fact that I got any compliance out of her in this environment makes me really happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1091.6s	1091.6	 Dogs are a product of their genetics and their life experience. As pet parents, we are in an ideal position to have a strong impact on their life experience, thereby creating a more well-behaved dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1103.6s	1103.6	 Both of my books will give you lots of details on socialization. Get regular tips and keep up with Inertia on Instagram.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPRq3-1Yq0E&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=327&pp=iAQB&t=1110.6s	1110.6	 Subscribe and click the bell to watch how I teach Inertia everything. In our next episode, we'll see where Inertia is after three weeks of training. We'll see you next time.
