https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=1.6s	1.6	 The future is coming super fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=3.6s	3.6	 I mean, pretty soon all of us will be using electric cars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=6.2s	6.2	 and we'll never have to wake up to an empty tank of gas ever again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=9.6s	9.6	 That's going to be hugely convenient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=11.6s	11.6	 Grocery shopping will become a thing of the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=13.8s	13.8	 because your groceries will just be there whenever you order them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=16.8s	16.8	 thereby saving you lots of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 Do you notice a theme here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=20.6s	20.6	 Things that save you time and make your life more convenient are the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=24.5s	24.5	 The same thing is true with how you get your pet's food delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 Go to PetFlow's website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 I'm going to have a link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 Choose your pet's favorite brand of food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=31.3s	31.3	 and tell PetFlow how often you want it delivered,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=33.5s	33.5	 maybe every two weeks, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=35.2s	35.2	 Enter code ZAK30 when you check out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 and you'll get $10 off your first three automatic shipments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 That's a great deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=40.9s	40.9	 Now let's meet Cessna the puppy and see if we can get her to increase her attention span.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 Click thumbs up for a new video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 This is Cessna the Pomeranian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=48.4s	48.4	 Make sure you're subscribed to my channel, especially if you've got a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=51.7s	51.7	 It's free. You'll be glad you did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=53.4s	53.4	 Keep up with the dog training revolution between videos too on Instagram.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 At ZAK George. I'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 But I do lots of live Q&A's over there and just generally help you with your dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 Wrap a copy of my number one bestselling dog training book, Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=66.6s	66.6	 All the links will be in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=68.5s	68.5	 You might have noticed that it's hard to keep a puppy's attention if you've ever had one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 Today, we're going to cover some exercises that'll make it a little bit easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 Emily, tell me how training is going with Cessna.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 Not very well. She does what she wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 We try focusing when there's too many people in the room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 It's out of the question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 So you're having a difficult time getting her to pay attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 especially around people, it sounds like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=88.2s	88.2	 She can sometimes sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=89.3s	89.3	 If she knows I have a treat, she will not do it very well, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=92.1s	92.1	 That's weird. So Cessna doesn't like to sit when you have a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=95.5s	95.5	 If she knows it's in my hand, she'll just bite my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 Let me see where she is with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 Let me see if I can duplicate what you're talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=101.3s	101.3	 So you're saying if she knows I have a treat that she's less likely to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=105.1s	105.1	 OK, let's she's more jumpy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=106.7s	106.7	 She's more jumpy. That would make sense, though, because puppies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=109.2s	109.2	 they don't really have any idea that we're trying to communicate with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=111.9s	111.9	 I mean, it's kind of this foreign concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 And it typically takes a few months to get serious traction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=116.6s	116.6	 Oh, look at this. I see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=117.6s	117.6	 Has she ever had turkey before?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=118.8s	118.8	 I don't think so. I try not to give her table food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=121.3s	121.3	 I mean, most of the time, people don't want to do table food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 because they're worried their dog's going to beg for table food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=125.9s	125.9	 But the way dogs become beggars is by feeding them from the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 Not by rewarding with high quality food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 Also, with a dog this small, that's the size of the treat we use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 There's no point in using anything bigger than this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=137.7s	137.7	 She'll work all day for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=139.1s	139.1	 I see what you're talking about here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=140.4s	140.4	 She's just super jumpy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=141.8s	141.8	 Sit. She's like, no, I want that turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 Yes, sit. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=147.4s	147.4	 That's one way to teach sit, actually, just to kind of wait it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=150.3s	150.3	 and wait for him to do it naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 That's called capturing a behavior when it happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=154.4s	154.4	 But I think we can lure her into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=156.2s	156.2	 You've tried to lure her into a sit and she just jumps like this, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 Yes. Right here, like with her lure, I'm like almost pressing it against her teeth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 because her tendency is to come up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 So I need to keep it like low and yes. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 Good. And it was for a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=169.7s	169.7	 But she sat because there's an art to luring a dog into a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=173.2s	173.2	 Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 I'm marking every time she does what I like with a solid yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 and following it up with a food reward as soon as she sits,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 even though she gets right back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=182.1s	182.1	 So this is kind of weird. I'm learning something here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=184.5s	184.5	 So usually when you lure, you're going above their head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=186.8s	186.8	 But when you do that with her, she tends to jump up on her hind legs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=189.6s	189.6	 which is super cute. But I'd rather her sit with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=192.3s	192.3	 It's almost like if you just go straight, like in a line like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=195.8s	195.8	 it kind of promotes her to sit down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=197.8s	197.8	 And right now I'm just letting her nibble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=199.2s	199.2	 I've got a tight grip on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 And I'm just letting her nibble on the treat to try and increase the duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=203.8s	203.8	 This is what's known as a rate of reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 In other words, I'm letting her get some payoff over a prolonged period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=210.5s	210.5	 in order to encourage her to hold that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=212.8s	212.8	 Rate of reinforcement is very important in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=215.4s	215.4	 Two years from now, you might treat every tenth time that you ask her to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=219.5s	219.5	 Right now, we're going to give her many little tiny rewards here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=222.8s	222.8	 I'm just kind of feeding that turkey out little by little,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 just for her sitting for a few seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=227.8s	227.8	 A great way to increase, especially a young dog's focus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=230.6s	230.6	 is to make sure that you give them lots of tiny, tiny rewards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 when they first accomplish something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=237.1s	237.1	 Normally, when I talk about rate of reinforcement, it's treat, treat, treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=240.3s	240.3	 like really small pieces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 But in this case, since she's so fast moving, every nibble she gets is like a new treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=245.6s	245.6	 And I'm just gradually, gradually releasing just the tiniest bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=250.3s	250.3	 as she holds that position right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 Very, very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=254.3s	254.3	 And look how long she's holding that sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=256.3s	256.3	 The reason it seems like it's difficult to get dogs like this to focus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 and that they're scatterbrained is because honestly, we as people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=262.9s	262.9	 tend to be a little too uninteresting to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 So it's on us to kind of be interesting to our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=267.6s	267.6	 It's not that they're not focused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=269.1s	269.1	 It's that we're not doing a good enough job of being interesting enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=272.5s	272.5	 to pay attention to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 There's a bit of a learning curve when a dog is this fast, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=276.4s	276.4	 They're going a mile a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=277.7s	277.7	 So you want to be there to acknowledge just those tiny moments of success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=280.7s	280.7	 Let me see if I can get her to hold a sit now without me having to let her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=283.5s	283.5	 just nibble on the treat. She's thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=287.7s	287.7	 Yes, good job. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=289.4s	289.4	 And you see how I immediately got the treat to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=291.6s	291.6	 You got to reward and acknowledge desirable behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=294.3s	294.3	 way more than you might think in order to get serious results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=297.2s	297.2	 It only takes a few times for something easy like sit for them to realize,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=300.7s	300.7	 oh, it gets me a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 If we can get them doing the behavior voluntarily, we do that any way that we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=305.4s	305.4	 because they're learning from the inside out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=307.2s	307.2	 Teaching our dogs to look at us is super critical so we can get their attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=311.1s	311.1	 to guide them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 The first thing that we needed to do was get her to be still for a moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=314.7s	314.7	 and hold that sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=315.6s	315.6	 So now that we've got that, we can teach her how to look at us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=318.2s	318.2	 Sit. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=319.1s	319.1	 I'm not even having to lure her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 Now I'm just going to hold the treat up here. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 That went really quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=323.3s	323.3	 I had like a fraction of a second of eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=325.6s	325.6	 Finding those small reasons to reward early on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=328.6s	328.6	 Super critical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=329.7s	329.7	 Now, of course, right now, she's just looking at a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=331.6s	331.6	 That's not really look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=333.1s	333.1	 But this gets her looking in this general region of space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=336.2s	336.2	 We'll see if we can transition that treat out right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=338.5s	338.5	 Look at me. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=340.3s	340.3	 Let the treat come from over here this time. OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=342.4s	342.4	 So now this really starts to shift the emphasis to my face instead of to a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 You might notice I'm rewarding about 100 percent of the time right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=350.9s	350.9	 You're motivating them to want to do the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=353.2s	353.2	 As these behaviors become easier, then you reward less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=355.9s	355.9	 In other words, the more reliable a behavior is, the less you need to reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=360.2s	360.2	 So right there, she's been holding the sit for many seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=362.6s	362.6	 And I'll just go ahead and reward one time there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=364.3s	364.3	 The less reliable behavior is the more you need to reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=367.5s	367.5	 The reason look at me is so important if your dog starts barking at somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=371.5s	371.5	 or just behaving in a way that you don't want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=373.5s	373.5	 You want to be able to say, hey, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=375.1s	375.1	 Will you sit and stay for a minute?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=377.1s	377.1	 OK, I love to lie down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=378.7s	378.7	 See how she's offering these behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=380.2s	380.2	 She's a little genius, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 One of the best ways to increase the dog's focus is to keep things optimistic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 and have a lot of fun with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=387.4s	387.4	 And the best way to have fun with them is to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=389.8s	389.8	 One of the fastest ways to build a bond with any dog is to get them playing with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=394.3s	394.3	 When a dog is having fun with you, they are far more motivated to want to listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=398.8s	398.8	 That's why play is such an important ingredient in having a super well-behaved dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=403.0s	403.0	 So keeping your dog engaged like this, I mean, she's interested in me right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=406.8s	406.8	 And this is a huge part of building focus with a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=409.6s	409.6	 Oh, boy, she's got it now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=412.0s	412.0	 She loves to play fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=413.2s	413.2	 A dog that'll play fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=414.6s	414.6	 You can teach him anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=416.1s	416.1	 But that's a powerful currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=418.6s	418.6	 And dogs love to chase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 This is a great way to motivate them to want to stay with you and come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=424.9s	424.9	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=425.9s	425.9	 I mean, she's paying attention to me right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=427.7s	427.7	 That's a form of focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=430.1s	430.1	 When she does catch her crazies, as we call them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=432.8s	432.8	 would you recommend like locking her in the room by herself or?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=436.1s	436.1	 What is your exercise regimen with her right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=438.3s	438.3	 We usually just play toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=439.7s	439.7	 I'll throw them across the house and she'll go get them and bring them back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=442.2s	442.2	 How long do your fetch sessions last with her?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=444.8s	444.8	 Probably about 10 minutes or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=446.2s	446.2	 Exercise is a real important factor in order to calm a hyper dog down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=450.9s	450.9	 You can't just assume that they can just turn it off and be mellow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=454.2s	454.2	 You know, they've got to get that energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=456.2s	456.2	 In terms of using the timeouts like you're talking about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=458.6s	458.6	 I would be very sparing about those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=460.3s	460.3	 There are times when a dog's just really wired and they're hyper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=463.0s	463.0	 and you're definitely too busy to tend to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=465.0s	465.0	 And in those cases, brief timeouts are OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=467.3s	467.3	 But do make sure that you're exercising her really well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=469.8s	469.8	 especially early in the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=471.5s	471.5	 That way, she's very likely to be more chill throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=474.2s	474.2	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=474.7s	474.7	 Click thumbs up for Cessna.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=476.4s	476.4	 She did a tremendous job today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYMLkqgyaE&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=478.1s	478.1	 You too, Emily.
