https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=4.1s	4.1	 Well, I don't know how you would use a shot collar or non-aversively other than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=7.7s	7.7	 you could put it on and have no power to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=9.7s	9.7	 And that wouldn't necessarily be aversive in and of itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=12.4s	12.4	 Slip leads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=13.3s	13.3	 I mean, we see them at vets and shelters all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 They're used to take dogs out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=16.6s	16.6	 Yeah, they can be used non-aversively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=18.1s	18.1	 If you're at a shelter and you're taking a dog out for a potty break on a slip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=21.4s	21.4	 lead and you're not focused on popping popping, which is the right way to use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 these tools, it's not right, but that's what people who use these tools will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=28.7s	28.7	 tell you use properly is to use forcefully, quickly, bluntly rather.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=34.1s	34.1	 It has to be effective enough to discourage the dog immediately as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 opposed to redirecting, taking a step back and deescalating instead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 escalating and working within the dog's comfort level while keeping those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=46.7s	46.7	 emotional brain chemicals stable and not bringing out the stress hormones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=51.4s	51.4	 Because when you do that, that's toxic to your dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 What was the question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=56.9s	56.9	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHX6zqaPVM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=34&pp=iAQB&t=57.3s	57.3	 So slip leads.
