https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I'm not gonna get triggered in this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=2.0s	2.0	 I'm not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=3.3s	3.3	 I've got some things that I've got to get off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=5.1s	5.1	 of my chest today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Now, keep in mind, the things I'm gonna talk about today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=9.2s	9.2	 are very much from a dog trainer's perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=12.3s	12.3	 There's a few scenarios that I can think of right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 Hello, puppy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=16.1s	16.1	 where I have to be borderline rude with people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=19.5s	19.5	 when I'm out and about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=20.8s	20.8	 And then it leaves me wondering,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 are they gonna complain about me on the internet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 and try to get me canceled?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 The thing is, sometimes it can be hard to advocate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=29.2s	29.2	 while simultaneously being nice to strangers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=32.1s	32.1	 The irony is that this video is probably more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=34.4s	34.4	 for people who don't have a dog than who do have a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=37.8s	37.8	 Recently, our dog, Inertia, had surgery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=40.8s	40.8	 Bri and I had talked about it and we decided to wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=42.8s	42.8	 until she was a bit older to spay her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 Due to the research that we've done,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=46.1s	46.1	 we felt better about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=47.3s	47.3	 And you know, after your dog goes through a medical event
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=49.6s	49.6	 like that, you've got to let them recover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 And you know, Inertia was convinced she was fully recovered
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 practically the next day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=55.3s	55.3	 My dog was spayed six days ago, period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 How long until she can play fetch again, question mark?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=62.1s	62.1	 Does anyone else do dictation instead of typing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 Fuzzy is a service that we continue to use all of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 It's like if your best friend was a vet or vet tech
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=70.9s	70.9	 and you could just text them anytime you wanted to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=73.1s	73.1	 Every time we've done this, less than a minute wait time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 And see, that's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 She thought to ask for a picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 I happen to have one right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 Oh, Savannah's typing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=80.7s	80.7	 That's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=81.5s	81.5	 Nice job keeping her from licking the incision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 Thank you very much, Savannah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 So basically she's saying Inertia looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 she's on the tail end of her recovery,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 but I should probably still work up to fetch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 at least over, you know, about three more days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 And that is why I am a dog trainer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 and not a vet or vet tech.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 Fuzzy is going to give you seven days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=98.5s	98.5	 of totally unlimited questions, completely free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=100.9s	100.9	 Go to yourfuzzy.com slash Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=102.6s	102.6	 I think a lot of you guys are going to relate with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=104.8s	104.8	 I mean, when you have a cute dog, which dog is not cute,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=109.1s	109.1	 everybody in the world wants to pet them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=111.3s	111.3	 And look, deep down, honestly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=112.7s	112.7	 I want to pet everyone's dog too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 I get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=115.2s	115.2	 But look, if you're training a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=117.1s	117.1	 it's probably not the best idea to let said dog be pet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 by anyone who wants to pet them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 So in general, when you're outside of the house and family,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=124.9s	124.9	 there are two types of people, seemingly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=127.7s	127.7	 that want to pet your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 I mean, there's this type of person who'll see your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 and they just cannot resist asking you to pet your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=134.8s	134.8	 But then there are people who don't ask at all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=137.1s	137.1	 to pet your dog and pet them without asking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=139.5s	139.5	 And believe it or not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=140.3s	140.3	 I'm not just talking about toddlers here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=142.8s	142.8	 Grownups do this all of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 All right, but let's talk about the first type first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=147.3s	147.3	 People who come up to you in public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 and they ask very nicely, can I please pet your dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 There's nothing wrong with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 I mean, your dog's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=153.5s	153.5	 It's nice that other people realize that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 But almost all of the time, I'm still going to tell them no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=159.1s	159.1	 I'm always asking myself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=160.7s	160.7	 how can I do that without being a jerk?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 I mean, someone's actually paying you a compliment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 when they get up the courage enough to ask you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 if they can pet your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=168.5s	168.5	 I can't tell you how many times that someone's asked this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=171.1s	171.1	 and I've told them, no, not right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 I'm training my dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 Yeah, in training, trying to teach her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=175.4s	175.4	 not to run up to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=177.4s	177.4	 You can't help but feel like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=178.6s	178.6	 they're somewhat offended by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 Or at least really thrown off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=181.8s	181.8	 because I think the average person would say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=183.6s	183.6	 yeah, sure, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=184.9s	184.9	 Now I'm not saying you should never ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=186.4s	186.4	 let anybody pet your dog when you're out in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 But generally, especially if you're training your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=190.9s	190.9	 it's probably not a good idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=192.4s	192.4	 to let anyone who wants to pet them pet them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=194.3s	194.3	 I mean, obviously lots of dogs have different personalities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=197.1s	197.1	 I mean, maybe your dog is perfectly happy and loves people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=199.8s	199.8	 but you might risk having them have that excitement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=202.7s	202.7	 and that jumping behavior and that exuberance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=205.1s	205.1	 be reinforced by getting pet by another person.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=209.8s	209.8	 with having a well-behaved dog in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=212.1s	212.1	 Or at the other end of the spectrum,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 maybe your dog's really nervous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=214.4s	214.4	 or doesn't like being approached by strangers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=221.3s	221.3	 and training in general, who knows?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 But you know, look, I understand it's a fine line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 when you're socializing a young puppy too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=227.6s	227.6	 And I believe deeply in socialization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=229.6s	229.6	 with people and strangers, but you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 there's a time and a place for puppy socialization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=234.2s	234.2	 And when you're out in public training your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 and you don't have any plans, socialization events in mind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 particularly with strangers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=241.4s	241.4	 that's probably not the most ideal situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 Of course, these are just general guidelines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=245.2s	245.2	 There's gonna be situations where you decide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=247.3s	247.3	 this is a great opportunity for someone to pet your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=250.1s	250.1	 But of course, you wanna make that decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=252.2s	252.2	 Now let's talk about the second type of person,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=254.4s	254.4	 which is really helping me kind of get at the heart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=256.9s	256.9	 of things that I need to really get off my chest today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=261.1s	261.1	 The person who comes up to your dog does not ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 and puts their hands on them or attempts to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 I think most of you watching this video know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=269.8s	269.8	 and understand how inconsiderate that can be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=271.9s	271.9	 I cannot think of a single scenario
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 where it's okay to go up to somebody's dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=276.7s	276.7	 when the person is there with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=278.2s	278.2	 and interact with them without permission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=281.0s	281.0	 I mean, this can go so wrong in so many ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 with so many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=285.5s	285.5	 Even if your dog is a super happy dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 who loves to be pet by strangers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=289.8s	289.8	 you still run the risk of reinforcing them that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 hey, there's a stranger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=293.3s	293.3	 I get to jump on that stranger and get pet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 And that is likely to make life difficult
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=297.4s	297.4	 for you moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=298.6s	298.6	 And also, like I said before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=299.9s	299.9	 there is a time and a place to socialize your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=302.1s	302.1	 But randomly, without a plan, I mean, that's just not it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 You guys can help me with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=306.7s	306.7	 I mean, what can we do to help generally educate the public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=311.3s	311.3	 to, number one, don't go up to a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=313.3s	313.3	 without permission and pet them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 when you ask to pet their dog, don't be offended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=319.5s	319.5	 You know, as a side note, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=320.6s	320.6	 we've accepted this basic etiquette
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 with service dogs in public for a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=325.1s	325.1	 Most people are supposed to know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 that you don't go up to a working dog and try to pet them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 And if they don't know that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=330.7s	330.7	 they'll probably be corrected by any service dog handler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=333.9s	333.9	 But personally, I mean, my feeling is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=335.6s	335.6	 I think we should extend this courtesy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=337.5s	337.5	 to any dog in public who's being walked or trained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=340.1s	340.1	 or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=340.9s	340.9	 This next point hits home with me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 and I think it will with a lot of you as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=345.1s	345.1	 When I run into people in public,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=346.4s	346.4	 let's say like a subscriber or something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=348.4s	348.4	 they usually fall, broadly speaking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=350.6s	350.6	 into a couple of categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=351.9s	351.9	 Sometimes they just wave, say hi, like your videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=354.4s	354.4	 Sometimes they wanna stop and chat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=356.6s	356.6	 and interact with the dog that I'm working with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=358.8s	358.8	 And sometimes they wanna talk a little bit longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=360.8s	360.8	 and get a photo, very flattering,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=363.2s	363.2	 and not realizing that most of the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=364.9s	364.9	 if I'm working with a dog in public,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=367.6s	367.6	 I really do need to keep like 100% of my attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=372.3s	372.3	 on the dog that I'm training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=373.6s	373.6	 I mean, number one, for safety,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 and secondly, to make sure that my training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=377.2s	377.2	 doesn't go off the rails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=378.5s	378.5	 And I also wanna make sure that I'm a responsible trainer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=381.2s	381.2	 to the dog that I'm working with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=382.8s	382.8	 even if I risk coming off a bit rude.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=384.5s	384.5	 I mean, especially if I'm working with a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=386.4s	386.4	 that's very delicate or likely to start reacting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=389.5s	389.5	 to something at any moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=391.5s	391.5	 I don't really have a lot of time, really at all,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=393.9s	393.9	 to explain to them what I'm doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=395.9s	395.9	 And that's because the second your attention is divided,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 things are likely to deteriorate quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=400.8s	400.8	 with the dog that you're training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=402.7s	402.7	 So, I mean, the dilemma is I always find myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 trying to be really nice and polite to the person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=406.7s	406.7	 while also keeping my training on track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=409.2s	409.2	 And so in my case, I just about always elect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=411.6s	411.6	 to keep my focus on the dog that I'm working with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=413.7s	413.7	 And even if that means being shorter than I'd like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 with very friendly people in public,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=420.7s	420.7	 about what you're going to say to people,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=426.0s	426.0	 sorry, I've been training right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=427.4s	427.4	 Thanks for asking, if I can even get it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=429.7s	429.7	 Seriously, in some touchy situations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=432.7s	432.7	 maybe I can get three words in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=433.7s	433.7	 What can you say in three words?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=435.6s	435.6	 Not now, bye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=436.8s	436.8	 Of everyone on the planet, you guys know how dogs can be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=441.2s	441.2	 So look, if you've got to be short with someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 to keep your dog under threshold,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=445.9s	445.9	 I think especially dog lovers will understand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=448.2s	448.2	 This next one is actually for people who do have dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=451.9s	451.9	 but you know, look, and this one, ah, phew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=454.7s	454.7	 I'm not going to get triggered in this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=456.8s	456.8	 I'm not.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=460.7s	460.7	 Surely most of us have experienced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=462.9s	462.9	 having an off-leash dog approach us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=466.1s	466.1	 when we're on a walk with our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=467.5s	467.5	 And look, a lot of that's on us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=468.8s	468.8	 I mean, if you're going to take your dog to an area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=471.2s	471.2	 where it's either legal and or customary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=474.2s	474.2	 for dogs to be off-leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=475.8s	475.8	 then you need to take that into account as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=478.1s	478.1	 Now, personally, I try to avoid putting myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=480.4s	480.4	 in situations like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=481.7s	481.7	 And in much of the United States,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=483.5s	483.5	 it's not legal to have your dog off-leash

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=486.9s	486.9	 I actually don't mind seeing other off-leash dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=489.4s	489.4	 even if it is technically against the rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=492.2s	492.2	 I mean, after all, I've had my dogs off-leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=494.5s	494.5	 plenty over the years in environments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=497.2s	497.2	 where they weren't supposed to be off-leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=499.4s	499.4	 But keep in mind, I mean, I spent considerable time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=501.4s	501.4	 training them and effort,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=502.7s	502.7	 making sure that they were reliable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=504.2s	504.2	 in an environment like that before doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=507.2s	507.2	 You can see how we did a lot of off-leash training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=509.1s	509.1	 with Inertia, but even today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=510.8s	510.8	 she's just not off-leash willy-nilly anywhere,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=513.0s	513.0	 but only in places where she's reliable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=515.6s	515.6	 And by reliable, I mean, she'll hold a down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=518.5s	518.5	 She'll come to me when I call her and so on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=520.3s	520.3	 even if she sees another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=522.0s	522.0	 And the thing is, like, if a dog is running up to my dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=525.5s	525.5	 that is immediate evidence that they are not reliable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=529.1s	529.1	 and should not be off-leash in that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=531.0s	531.0	 I think it must be common for a lot of people to assume
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=534.1s	534.1	 that, hey, my dog is so friendly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=535.9s	535.9	 Even if they run up to someone, they're so non-threatening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=539.6s	539.6	 and they probably just wanna say hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=541.2s	541.2	 And after all, if someone can't take a nice greeting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=543.3s	543.3	 from a dog, what kind of person are they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=545.3s	545.3	 I think what we have to remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=547.8s	547.8	 is that dogs are pretty complex beings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=549.8s	549.8	 I mean, not every dog is welcoming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=552.4s	552.4	 of a strange dog coming up to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=554.2s	554.2	 That really puts other people in a very awkward situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=558.6s	558.6	 It can be really upsetting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=559.9s	559.9	 I mean, if you've worked with your dog very hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=561.8s	561.8	 and you're keeping them on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=562.9s	562.9	 and you're abiding by the rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=564.5s	564.5	 and you still have to deal with unplanned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=566.2s	566.2	 or unwanted encounters,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=567.8s	567.8	 it's certainly stressful to the person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=569.8s	569.8	 It could be very stressful to your dog as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=572.6s	572.6	 And obviously, it could even be dangerous,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=574.3s	574.3	 depending on context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=576.2s	576.2	 Personally, Inertia is the first dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=579.2s	579.2	 that I've had that really enjoys the company of other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=583.8s	583.8	 With my first generation of border collies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=585.7s	585.7	 I have a lot of experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=587.6s	587.6	 of keeping dogs away from my guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=589.9s	589.9	 I'm gonna tell you what my protocol is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=591.7s	591.7	 when an off-leash dog approaches me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=594.0s	594.0	 I'm not saying you should do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=595.1s	595.1	 I'm just telling you how I handle it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=596.7s	596.7	 Number one, I'm gonna make sure my dog is in a down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=599.6s	599.6	 And I will not, in any circumstance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=602.7s	602.7	 that I can think of right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=604.6s	604.6	 allow a strange dog that I don't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=608.1s	608.1	 to interact with my dog spontaneously like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=610.6s	610.6	 I mean, I don't care how friendly they look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=612.2s	612.2	 how sweet they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=613.2s	613.2	 I will physically step in and prevent a dog, if necessary,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=617.0s	617.0	 from interacting with my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=618.4s	618.4	 Now, fortunately, most dogs are pretty good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=620.5s	620.5	 at understanding body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=621.9s	621.9	 So a prompt no or aah or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=625.0s	625.0	 is probably something that they've heard before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=627.1s	627.1	 And usually body language like that from me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=629.7s	629.7	 and being very obvious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=630.6s	630.6	 I don't want this dog near my dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=632.8s	632.8	 really clues the other person in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=634.2s	634.2	 So hopefully the dog has a good recall, runs back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=636.4s	636.4	 If not, then, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=638.0s	638.0	 I try to create a physical barrier more or less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=640.7s	640.7	 The thing is, I'm obviously a dog lover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=642.4s	642.4	 I hope that's obvious anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=643.8s	643.8	 And I wish I could meet and interact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=645.7s	645.7	 with every dog on earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=647.1s	647.1	 But again, it really does come down to the setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=649.8s	649.8	 There's a time and a place for dog to dog interaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=653.2s	653.2	 I know that when Bri and I are on a walk together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=655.6s	655.6	 we have a system where one of us will take care of the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=658.7s	658.7	 while the other keeps the off leash dog away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=661.0s	661.0	 So if you have a partner, that can be helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=663.1s	663.1	 I mean, guys understand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=664.5s	664.5	 an interaction between two dogs can go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=666.9s	666.9	 so many different ways and not all of them are positive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=671.4s	671.4	 I feel like I've worked with enough dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=673.5s	673.5	 to understand that I can't be so arrogant

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=678.9s	678.9	 or feeling or what their motivations are in two seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=681.5s	681.5	 And even if they're completely friendly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=683.7s	683.7	 you don't know what my dog's going to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=685.1s	685.1	 I mean, my dog's gonna play with them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=686.4s	686.4	 but another dog might not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=687.7s	687.7	 So what about when you're pressured by someone else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=690.2s	690.2	 who has a dog, say a perfectly friendly, well-trained dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=693.7s	693.7	 and they insist, we should have our dogs play together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=696.9s	696.9	 And again, as I've said throughout this video,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=698.3s	698.3	 I'm all for this in a specific situation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=700.9s	700.9	 but almost never with a dog that I've just met.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=703.8s	703.8	 I mean, I got a page of questions to ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=705.8s	705.8	 I need to get to know this dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=707.6s	707.6	 before I have them interact with my dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=709.5s	709.5	 I mean, you think about the Moira series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=711.2s	711.2	 I didn't think Moira and Inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=713.4s	713.4	 had a similar enough play style
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=715.1s	715.1	 to necessarily interact during that series, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=717.8s	717.8	 I didn't even have them interact at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=719.4s	719.4	 Bree and Inertia are down there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=720.7s	720.7	 but Moira is like really, really wound up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=724.4s	724.4	 However, Moira since has shown she's wonderful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=727.2s	727.2	 when she interacts with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=728.9s	728.9	 And in hindsight, I think Inertia and Moira
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=731.5s	731.5	 probably would have been great friends,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=733.2s	733.2	 but I wasn't completely sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=734.7s	734.7	 So that was the call that I made.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=736.9s	736.9	 Think about it, even in your immediate circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=738.5s	738.5	 with your friends and your family,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=739.9s	739.9	 it's kind of this common expectation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=741.9s	741.9	 like, oh, I've got a new dog, or you've got a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=744.3s	744.3	 They should become best friends right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=746.4s	746.4	 If you're comfortable with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=747.7s	747.7	 and you know your dog really well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=749.2s	749.2	 and you feel like you know the other dog very well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=751.3s	751.3	 set up a play date, let them play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=753.2s	753.2	 If you're pretty sure they'll be good together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=755.5s	755.5	 but not completely sure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=756.7s	756.7	 remember you can always use things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=757.9s	757.9	 like a basket muzzle on the dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=759.9s	759.9	 which are a really humane way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=761.7s	761.7	 to keep them from biting each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=763.5s	763.5	 But look, I'm telling you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=764.6s	764.6	 if you feel like your dog's play style
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=768.3s	768.3	 does not match that dog's play style,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLY4xNuiNKo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=151&pp=iAQB&t=771.1s	771.1	 do not hesitate to say no.
