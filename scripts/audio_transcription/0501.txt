https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=21.7s	21.7	 and see how Sawyer does with some other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 But of course, you never want to send your dog the doggy daycare hangry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 and don't be in a position of having to feed your dog whatever food you can find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 when it's late at night and you're out of dog food.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 You can tweak your delivery schedule at any time for any reason.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 or your dog needs some socialization with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=51.7s	51.7	 Of course, doggy daycares aren't for all dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 but if you think your dog might be a good candidate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=56.1s	56.1	 let's cover a few things first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=57.4s	57.4	 The whole idea of taking your dog to a doggy daycare
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 is to make sure they're having a great time and having an overall quality experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 Avoid taking your dog to a daycare that subscribes to outdated trading methods,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 for example, like using choke prong or electric collars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=71.3s	71.3	 Most doggy daycares will offer you a tour of the facility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=74.1s	74.1	 so that you can get an idea of what a typical day might be like for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 Now, if they don't do that, they're probably not the place for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 During playtime at most doggy daycares,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=82.2s	82.2	 they'll separate dogs based on their size or their energy level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=85.6s	85.6	 And since they really get to know the dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=87.7s	87.7	 they'll put your dog in the more ideal group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 As always, it's a great idea to exercise your dog just before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 putting them in a highly exciting situation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=97.5s	97.5	 like being around a bunch of happy dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=99.3s	99.3	 All right, let's go see how Sawyer does at Central Bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 Come on, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 Most daycares will have a trial day and do a behavior assessment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 with a few dogs that are dog-friendly and have a great temperament.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=108.4s	108.4	 That's what we're going to do with Sawyer today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 Angie, the manager and dog trainer here at Central Bark Doggy Daycare in New Orleans,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=114.6s	114.6	 has chosen a few dogs for us to introduce Sawyer to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 So we're going to see how he does with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=118.9s	118.9	 Hey, Angie, how's it going today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=120.3s	120.3	 Hi, good. How are you guys doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=122.1s	122.1	 Awesome. This is Sawyer, the French Bulldog I was telling you about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=125.1s	125.1	 Hi. Hi, Sawyer. Hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=127.5s	127.5	 Angie, what do you look for when you're trying to find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 if a dog is a good fit for the doggy daycare here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 Yeah, so there's not real one thing that we really look for,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 but I guess the top three words I would choose are first, non-reactive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=140.5s	140.5	 two, confident, and three, comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 And we just want them to be happy here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=144.1s	144.1	 Do you have any particular dogs in mind for Sawyer and me today?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 Yeah, we got a group today and I have a few in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=150.2s	150.2	 So as we walk back here, I noticed he heard the dogs barking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 and he got a little nervous immediately,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 which is normal, I would think, for dogs that aren't socialized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=157.4s	157.4	 So we want to proceed very cautiously, obviously, to give him a good experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 It might have been tempting to just try and rush him through that situation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=164.5s	164.5	 but it's much better to go slow, play it safe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=167.3s	167.3	 in order to avoid creating a host of issues later on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=170.8s	170.8	 Having the dogs interact through the fence is a great idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=174.1s	174.1	 Who's this dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=175.1s	175.1	 This is Grigri.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 Grigri?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=177.2s	177.2	 I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=178.3s	178.3	 Grigri is doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=179.6s	179.6	 Look at Sawyer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=180.3s	180.3	 This way you can safely introduce the two dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 by having them greet each other through the fence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 I feel comfortable in letting them interact now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 How about you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 Yeah, let's do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 Alicia is going to come in too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=194.5s	194.5	 And see, he's getting a little bossy there, but he's reacting well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 Obviously, Sawyer being a puppy only five months old,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=200.4s	200.4	 he's one of the very playful puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 And I got to say Grigri is being very tolerant,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=204.8s	204.8	 because you know how obnoxious puppies can be sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=207.3s	207.3	 You can see Grigri's hair starting to stand up a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=209.9s	209.9	 getting a little annoyed with Sawyer, as many dogs do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=213.1s	213.1	 So I wanted to just kind of intervene,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 give them a moment to settle down a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 All right, so we're bringing in a puppy now, a Bassethelm puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=220.6s	220.6	 Oh, gosh, this is going to be the cutest thing ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=222.9s	222.9	 And he's closer to Sawyer's age, around six months, you said?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=225.7s	225.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=226.3s	226.3	 And you can see Sawyer's just ready to...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 burst into play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=231.1s	231.1	 And they're going to sniff each other, all very normal behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 Now, his hair is standing up a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 Elvis!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 But that's not necessarily a bad thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=238.7s	238.7	 That just means they're a little unsure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=242.5s	242.5	 And since right there, he's trying to mount,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 we want to discourage that type of behavior too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=246.3s	246.3	 But a little bit of it is pretty normal, and it's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=248.4s	248.4	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=249.4s	249.4	 And so Elvis is getting a little annoyed right here, saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 hey, back off, you're kind of an annoying puppy here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=256.5s	256.5	 So I mean, I feel okay about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=257.9s	257.9	 But although, all right, all right, all right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=260.9s	260.9	 You can see this is why it's a really good idea to exercise a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=264.5s	264.5	 before having them be in an exciting situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=266.9s	266.9	 The way we get good results here is by letting them play very naturally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=270.1s	270.1	 under very supervised conditions, just like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=273.4s	273.4	 And see, there's never a way to know definitely how a dog is going to behave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=277.6s	277.6	 with another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 That's why you always want to supervise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=279.7s	279.7	 You always want to be cautious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=281.1s	281.1	 But by taking some common sense measures like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=284.5s	284.5	 you can increase the likelihood that things are going to go well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=287.2s	287.2	 Agree?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=287.7s	287.7	 Yeah, definitely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 Me too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=289.8s	289.8	 And see, that's all very normal right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=293.1s	293.1	 Sawyer, you're doing a great job, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=295.5s	295.5	 So are you, Elvis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 Good boy, Elvis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=297.2s	297.2	 Always so sleepy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=298.7s	298.7	 This is Bentley, another black lab.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 But he's a little bit more hyper than Grigri.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=304.5s	304.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 Gotcha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=305.8s	305.8	 Oh, boy, here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=306.7s	306.7	 Let's see how this goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=311.5s	311.5	 And you can see, I mean, Sawyer's getting a workout right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=313.9s	313.9	 And this all helps to get their energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=315.7s	315.7	 While you don't want to rely on dogs playing with each other to be primary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=319.2s	319.2	 exercise, playing with other dogs is a great way to encourage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=322.2s	322.2	 supplementary exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=324.3s	324.3	 Bentley is being incredibly tolerant of this puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=329.2s	329.2	 It's a fine line between letting dogs really interact and have that natural
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=332.8s	332.8	 communication and letting them go too far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=335.1s	335.1	 So you do have to feel that out with your individual dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=337.9s	337.9	 So this is all going really well so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=340.2s	340.2	 I'm really encouraged by how Sawyer is behaving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=342.5s	342.5	 The other dogs are doing wonderfully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=344.2s	344.2	 I think Sawyer's at the point where we can now phase in a small group of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 A lot of good, healthy body language going on here from the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=350.6s	350.6	 They're sniffing each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=352.2s	352.2	 They're playing with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=353.5s	353.5	 They're behaving normally with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=355.8s	355.8	 Oh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=357.3s	357.3	 Oh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=357.8s	357.8	 Oh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=358.3s	358.3	 Oh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=359.1s	359.1	 The dogs are reacting really well to Sawyer too, because he's a bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=362.2s	362.2	 overbearing at moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=363.3s	363.3	 But overall, they're doing really well together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=365.8s	365.8	 So Sawyer's getting real worked up here, gravitating to Bentley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=369.8s	369.8	 But Bentley's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=372.1s	372.1	 But he's still, you know, he's not going over the top.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=374.3s	374.3	 He's behaving appropriately, I'd say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=377.1s	377.1	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=377.6s	377.6	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=378.1s	378.1	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=378.6s	378.6	 Why you got to be so crazy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=380.6s	380.6	 So right there, I went up to Sawyer in an attempt to let him know I wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=384.2s	384.2	 going to have that hyperactive behavior, because he was annoying Bentley a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=387.4s	387.4	 too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=388.2s	388.2	 And he automatically just dialed it back a minute, because he's already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=390.9s	390.9	 learning from these experiences.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=400.5s	400.5	 So what do you do if your dog is not an ideal candidate for doggy daycare?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 Well, in general, I'd recommend that you check out reputable dog walkers in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3cXDBdoA8&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=502&pp=iAQB&t=408.6s	408.6	 area.
