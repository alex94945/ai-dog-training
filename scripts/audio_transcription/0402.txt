https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 some of my favorite ways to keep dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=36.9s	36.9	 from doing things they shouldn't, and to keep them safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 See, we often tend to give our dogs too much freedom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 too early on in the training process, like this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=48.6s	48.6	 Dogs are so smart, and they're so curious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 and they're gonna find things to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=52.1s	52.1	 Even though I've got her on leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 and I'm still supervising her,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 Whether you have a puppy like Callie,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 or you have a new adult dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 step one is to make it impossible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 for the most common unwanted behaviors to occur at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=66.8s	66.8	 For example, if your dog doesn't have access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=69.1s	69.1	 to the couch unsupervised,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=70.5s	70.5	 then it's impossible for them to destroy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=72.3s	72.3	 The second step would be to teach your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=74.1s	74.1	 how to actually behave,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 but today we're gonna focus on the first step,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=77.3s	77.3	 because management is the name of the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 It sounds simple, but dogs tend to be very crafty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=82.3s	82.3	 about doing things we don't want them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=84.4s	84.4	 when we think we're supervising them appropriately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 Supervising an off-leash eight-week-old puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=89.2s	89.2	 that's one thing, because they're pretty clumsy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=91.5s	91.5	 and relatively slow, and usually pretty clingy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=93.9s	93.9	 and likely to stay near you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 But over the next few weeks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=96.5s	96.5	 those puppies are gonna become really capable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=98.4s	98.4	 and fast, and much more challenging to contain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=101.3s	101.3	 The optimal way to manage your dog's surroundings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 is to have them attached to you like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=105.7s	105.7	 during the initial training phases.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=111.3s	111.3	 is strongly recommended during the first year of training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 with any dog of any age,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 so even if you've adopted an older dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=117.3s	117.3	 it is not too late to start training them from the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 So let's go over some of my favorite products
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 and favorite ways to make sure that raising a new dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=124.6s	124.6	 goes as smoothly as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 For times when we cannot directly tend to our dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=129.3s	129.3	 crates are wonderful for controlling your dog's environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 for short periods, or overnight while they sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=134.3s	134.3	 This is the large double-door crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=135.7s	135.7	 from Carlson Pet Products.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 It comes completely assembled, which is a huge plus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 I like the two-door option on this crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=142.3s	142.3	 because it seems to make introducing a crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=144.2s	144.2	 to a dog for the first time much simpler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 Okay, that's nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=148.1s	148.1	 That's exactly what I was hoping for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=149.8s	149.8	 It's much less intimidating to a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=151.8s	151.8	 because you can really open it up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=153.4s	153.4	 when you're getting your dog comfortable with the crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=155.2s	155.2	 and it gives you more versatility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 as to where you can put it, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 If your puppy accidentally locks you in the crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=160.3s	160.3	 there's this second door that you can escape from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 I'm just putting little bits of turkey in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 to just kinda get her comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=165.7s	165.7	 with going in and out of the crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 and she's doing really well, isn't she?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=169.2s	169.2	 Good job, Callie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=170.3s	170.3	 And then come out over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 For those of you that have used a crate in the past,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=173.5s	173.5	 you've likely found that it's your dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=175.3s	175.3	 favorite place in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=176.8s	176.8	 In fact, to this day, I have a couple of crates in my house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 so that my own dogs can have a place to relax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=181.3s	181.3	 and call their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=182.4s	182.4	 I don't even need to close the doors anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 This one sets up and collapses in seconds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=186.8s	186.8	 so they take up almost no space when you're not using them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=189.5s	189.5	 During the potty training phase,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 it's a good idea to control the size of the crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=193.1s	193.1	 and only gradually enlarge the size
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 using a divider panel like this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 This is automatically included with the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 By keeping the crate small like this during sleeping hours,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=201.7s	201.7	 you're encouraging your dog to hold it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 until you let them out and show them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=204.8s	204.8	 the appropriate place to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=206.1s	206.1	 But as your dog learns to not have accidents in the crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=208.7s	208.7	 you can remove the divider panel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=210.4s	210.4	 and make that crate nice and roomy for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 For that reason, I tend to lean towards oversized crates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=215.2s	215.2	 so that your dog can have as much room as possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 after the initial potty training phase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 But if your dog ever does have an accident,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=221.2s	221.2	 as is particularly common in the beginning phases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 of crate training a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 it's nice to know that this comes out nice and easily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 This is really easy to clean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 if you do need to clean up an accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=230.9s	230.9	 And I'm gonna give her some treats right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=232.9s	232.9	 through the crate just to kind of make it interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 Now I'm gonna open the door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 so she doesn't think it closes all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 You wanna really go out of your way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=241.4s	241.4	 when introducing a crate to make it a fun place to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=245.3s	245.3	 Closing it for a second, unlocking it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=247.8s	247.8	 Come on out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=248.9s	248.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=249.8s	249.8	 And she has no problem going in and out of the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=252.1s	252.1	 Will you sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=255.4s	255.4	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=256.3s	256.3	 And the fact that that's a good way to test
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=257.9s	257.9	 how comfortable your dog is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=259.1s	259.1	 do they readily do things that they would normally do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 when they're not in the crate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=263.4s	263.4	 In other words, she's complying with me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=265.4s	265.4	 which would indicate that she's not too stressed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=267.8s	267.8	 Will you lie down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=270.2s	270.2	 There you go, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=271.6s	271.6	 You're a crate training puppy prodigy, aren't you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 If your dog has passed the teething and chewing stage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 which you are not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=277.3s	277.3	 you might wanna put something comfortable in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=279.6s	279.6	 so that they can relax and hang out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 You could always put some old towels in the crate too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 that might make it a little more comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=285.4s	285.4	 rather than spending too much money on a bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=287.9s	287.9	 But don't leave your dog unsupervised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=289.3s	289.3	 with things that they can chew up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=290.7s	290.7	 The crate has to be very secure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 Both of these doors have this multi-point locking system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=295.7s	295.7	 and that'll keep your dog safe and secure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 Not all dogs are gonna be accepting of crates though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=299.8s	299.8	 and you should use a crate pretty sparingly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=301.7s	301.7	 That's why it's important to have other ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=303.5s	303.5	 to contain your dog and keep them safe too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 Gates like this are an incredible way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=307.4s	307.4	 to give your dog more freedom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=308.8s	308.8	 while keeping them from acquiring bad habits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=310.8s	310.8	 Kelly, you're not supposed to chew the gate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=312.4s	312.4	 Dogs new to training should only slowly be introduced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 to the rest of the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=316.1s	316.1	 And gates are a great way to keep control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=317.7s	317.7	 of your dog's surroundings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=318.7s	318.7	 when you're more lightly supervising them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 This is the Tuppy Expandable Pet Gate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=322.3s	322.3	 so it fits lots of different sizes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=324.5s	324.5	 No assembly required at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=326.3s	326.3	 Comes out of the box just like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 And the Tuppy Expandable Pet Gates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 don't require permanent installation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=331.6s	331.6	 It's easily removed so it's there when you want it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=333.9s	333.9	 and it's out of the way when you don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 So that's nice and firm right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=336.9s	336.9	 If you have cats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=337.7s	337.7	 they can easily pass through this little door here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=339.7s	339.7	 So this is a great option
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=341.0s	341.0	 for keeping your dog away from the litter box
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=342.9s	342.9	 which I know that many of you have issues with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=345.3s	345.3	 And these come in lots of different sizes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 so you can find the right one for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=348.7s	348.7	 Indoor pet pens are fantastic too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=350.7s	350.7	 because they allow your dog to be near you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=352.4s	352.4	 when you can't fully supervise them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=354.6s	354.6	 And this convertible pet yard also from Carlson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=357.2s	357.2	 is a great option because not only does it work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=359.3s	359.3	 as a sturdy standalone pen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=361.1s	361.1	 but you can also attach it to the wall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=362.6s	362.6	 to give your dog a giant space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=364.3s	364.3	 This is probably my favorite use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=365.9s	365.9	 of the convertible pet yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=367.2s	367.2	 You can give your dog a lot of area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=369.2s	369.2	 and most of us can find an area of the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=371.1s	371.1	 where it makes sense to kind of corner it off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=372.9s	372.9	 You can also use this as a really big expandable gate too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=376.7s	376.7	 So if you have a giant room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=378.1s	378.1	 that you wanna create a barrier between, this is perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=381.0s	381.0	 And you can also buy extra panels for it, which I like too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=384.1s	384.1	 Just before Carlson approached me to make this video,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=386.4s	386.4	 I actually bought one of their adjustable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=387.9s	387.9	 freestanding pet gates with my own money
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=390.3s	390.3	 because we got a new house and we have a staircase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=392.8s	392.8	 that we wanna limit our older dog's access to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=395.5s	395.5	 because it can be a little slippery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=397.3s	397.3	 It just happens to be a Carlson product
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=399.1s	399.1	 and I think it's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOeFDnstAY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=403&pp=iAQB&t=400.5s	400.5	 I'm gonna have links to all the products we covered
