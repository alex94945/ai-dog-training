https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHHZYoK-JU0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=602&pp=iAQB&t=58.6s	58.6	 After you've taught your dog some basic stuff, this would be the next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHHZYoK-JU0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=602&pp=iAQB&t=62.4s	62.4	 So if you're at that point, try and apply some of these exercises that you learn about

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHHZYoK-JU0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=602&pp=iAQB&t=140.5s	140.5	 I have an excellent video on teaching your dog how to listen to you from a greater distance

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHHZYoK-JU0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=602&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 Now don't be afraid to take a step back and give your dog some easy ones too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHHZYoK-JU0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=602&pp=iAQB&t=191.3s	191.3	 Think back to grade school when you were learning some type of new math, maybe long division,
