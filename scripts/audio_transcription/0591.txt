https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Tomorrow we're going to be shooting a dog training video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=2.2s	2.2	 You guys are going to love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=3.4s	3.4	 A lot of you have asked for more puppy videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 And we have been using a lot of puppies lately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 That actually is not a conscious decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=9.3s	9.3	 And it's just been working out that way because of that one right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 She falls in love with every puppy she sees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=15.8s	15.8	 Not only am I excited about doing a puppy video,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=18.9s	18.9	 I have also been waiting to do another trick video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 I'm really excited. Trick video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 So we're going to teach whisper and speak, hopefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=26.4s	26.4	 So that's like bark and then bark quieter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=29.6s	29.6	 Animal behavior is an elective that I've been waiting to be able to take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=32.6s	32.6	 It's a 4000 level class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=33.9s	33.9	 I had to do all these other prerequisites to be able to take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 And I'm finally in it and I've been really enjoying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=40.7s	40.7	 The title of this chapter is learning, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=43.6s	43.6	 And it's not really they haven't been using dogs as examples very much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 So I was pleased to turn the page and come across a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 So this is a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=52.9s	52.9	 And the bottom line with clicker training is you click every time your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=56.6s	56.6	 does what you like and then you follow it up with a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 It's just basic classical conditioning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 If you've ever learned about that in school, to me, it seems like new people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=65.4s	65.4	 especially if they have that button in their hand to press and click like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=69.7s	69.7	 The moment their dog does what they like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=71.9s	71.9	 And then, of course, follow it up with the food reward to let them know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=74.7s	74.7	 that you really like it or toy if you condition them to the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=78.4s	78.4	 But that's the major benefit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=80.1s	80.1	 But there's a lot of benefits of clicker training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=81.7s	81.7	 And I think it's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 They also talk about how different currencies are valuable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 and that for many animals, a toy can be more exciting than food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=90.2s	90.2	 Imagine that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=91.2s	91.2	 It's so nice to see it printed, you know, in a college book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 And I expected them to be a little more traditional when they came to like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=98.2s	98.2	 dog training and stuff. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 I think I think if you would have been taking this class several years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 there would be a stronger emphasis on, you know, things like like punishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=109.2s	109.2	 The book is very clear that it's a more effective way to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=111.5s	111.5	 As a matter of fact, the most advanced types of learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=114.6s	114.6	 can only be taught with positive reinforcement training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 And the book is very explicit about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=119.5s	119.5	 The book goes on to explain a shock mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=122.4s	122.4	 and compare it to positive reinforcement training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=124.5s	124.5	 And I think it makes the point that, yes, a shock mat can be effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=127.9s	127.9	 A shock map, if you don't know, is where you can put it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 A dog can walk on it and it will provide a mild,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=134.5s	134.5	 electrical stimulation of some kind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=136.5s	136.5	 Is that safe to say? Am I saying that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 Yes. But actually, they make the point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 that the shock mat by itself is not effective at all,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 because once you take the shock mat away, the dog is back on the couch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=148.9s	148.9	 So if you put a shock mat on the couch to keep your dog off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 And you teach them to avoid a piece of plastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 But you see, that's anyway, I get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=155.7s	155.7	 So that's a bit superficial, is all that's saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=158.4s	158.4	 But it's very nice to see that some scientists have taken the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=163.2s	163.2	 to do like a technical study where they see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 how hundreds of dogs respond to a shock mat versus just being given.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=171.1s	171.1	 A nice place to sleep and shown that this is where you sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=173.9s	173.9	 Could it be true that a science textbook is encouraging you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=177.7s	177.7	 to use less technical terms? Is it possible?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=181.8s	181.8	 I was not sure it was possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=184.2s	184.2	 Officially, it is out of favor to use like the technical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=189.1s	189.1	 positive punishment, negative reinforcement terms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=192.6s	192.6	 because it's too confusing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 These distinctions do not drip off the tongue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=196.1s	196.1	 and can degenerate into semantic squabbles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=199.1s	199.1	 As a result, many behaviorists are often now content to use reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=203.2s	203.2	 and punishment without adding qualifying terms such as positive or negative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=207.5s	207.5	 Isn't it nice to hear?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=208.6s	208.6	 And I think a lot of you will agree out there who follow dog training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=212.3s	212.3	 whether you do it professionally as a hobby or you're brand new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=215.8s	215.8	 I think we can all kind of agree that a lot of the terminology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 that that they use in dog training today is just unnecessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=222.9s	222.9	 over complicated, don't you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 It's almost more of an art than a science, just because every dog is different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=228.4s	228.4	 and every person is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=229.6s	229.6	 And there's no way you can convey that in a little formula.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=233.4s	233.4	 We know that if the outcome of a behavior is good,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 then the dog is likely to repeat that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=237.7s	237.7	 If the outcome is unpleasant, then the dog is less likely to repeat that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=242.7s	242.7	 And which one do you kind of favor?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=244.5s	244.5	 Which path do you choose for yourself when you adopt a strategy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=248.6s	248.6	 of teaching your dog by reinforcing behaviors you like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=251.8s	251.8	 instead of punishing the behaviors you don't like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=253.9s	253.9	 One of the instant benefits is there is no risk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=257.2s	257.2	 to having any side effects, you know, your dog dreading training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 or ears going back or tail going between the legs or whatever it might be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=264.8s	264.8	 The most advanced types of teaching that there are must be taught
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=267.8s	267.8	 through positive reinforcement training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 Agility dogs who have to go really fast, they don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=272.7s	272.7	 There's no negative training used there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=275.2s	275.2	 They have to be having fun and enjoying it if they're going to like run really fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=278.6s	278.6	 I'm fortunate because my origins in dog training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=281.7s	281.7	 were in competitive dog frisbee, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=284.8s	284.8	 and when you're doing competitive frisbee, you have to teach your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=287.6s	287.6	 lots of fun, cool tricks like leaping off your back into the air to catch a frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=292.1s	292.1	 It's called a vault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 When they do that, you can't make a dog do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lu--5Yv22A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=592&pp=iAQB&t=297.5s	297.5	 You have to make them want to.
