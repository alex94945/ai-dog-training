https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I've got one of the largest puppies here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=2.0s	2.0	 Would you believe that Satchmo, the Irish Wolfhound, is only five months old?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=6.9s	6.9	 I can't believe it either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 We're going to see how well he's doing on his training today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=10.7s	10.7	 Specifically, I want to see how Satchmo does around distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=13.8s	13.8	 I hope to teach him a trick today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 And I want to see how well he responds to play as currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=19.4s	19.4	 Click thumbs up for Satchmo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=21.1s	21.1	 Also, make sure you're subscribed to my channel and pick up a copy of my book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 Oh, boy. Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=26.7s	26.7	 So that you have all the information you need at your fingertips to raise the perfect dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 I have no idea what's in this box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=34.7s	34.7	 BarkBox is a monthly subscription service for really unique dog toys and treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 Looks like this month's theme is back to school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=41.2s	41.2	 Satchmo, what is this? It's milk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 I mean, who would ever predict that this would be something a dog would like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=48.1s	48.1	 And this is what I love about BarkBox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=49.9s	49.9	 What's this? Only one at a time, dude.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 A little toy like this can be really neat because it's unusual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 You have like an unusual squeak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=56.9s	56.9	 And then there's this crinkly sound in it, which can be really enticing to many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 My doggies soft baked cookies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 They're apple duck flavored, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=64.8s	64.8	 Can't go wrong with apple duck flavored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 If for some reason your dog doesn't love something in your BarkBox, just let him know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 And they'll send you something your dog absolutely loves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=73.8s	73.8	 You can get a free BarkBox by going to barkbox.com slash Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 I'll have a link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 So, for example, if you sign up for, say, six BarkBoxes, they'll actually send you seven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 Irish wolfhounds were actually originally bred to hunt wolves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 Isn't that crazy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=89.5s	89.5	 They are the tallest of all dog breeds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 They can reach as high as seven feet when on their hind legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=95.6s	95.6	 Every dog, though, regardless of their breed, has their own personality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 And that's the most important thing to remember.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=101.4s	101.4	 Now, Satchmo is off to a good start, but I'd like to see how far along he is in his training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=105.8s	105.8	 and what I can help him with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 So we've got a lot to do today, don't we?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=110.2s	110.2	 Since eye contact is vital, I'd like to see how Satchmo is doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 when I ask him to look at me while he's distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Because remember, if I can get his eyes on me, I can guide him a lot easier in future training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=120.6s	120.6	 For example, if you ever hope to have an off leash dog, you've got to have the leave it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 look at me combo really solid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 Look at me. Not working too well, is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 Can't get his eyes on me when I put a treat in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=132.3s	132.3	 That's what we've got to improve on, because obviously, if I can't get his attention on me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 with just a treat in front of him, how am I going to get his attention on me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=139.6s	139.6	 when a more significant distraction comes around?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 So you can see he's leaving it alone right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=145.3s	145.3	 But can I get his eyes on me? That's the important part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=148.9s	148.9	 Up here, almost, he glanced at me. I actually could have rewarded that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 But I'm going to try and get a yes right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=154.8s	154.8	 I'm not going to miss my second chance to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=156.8s	156.8	 Now I'm going to try throwing it, giving it motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 Things that move are a lot more distracting for most dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=161.7s	161.7	 And by teaching them to think from the inside out, rather than forcing them to do something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 you're teaching your dog how to reason through situations like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=173.6s	173.6	 Yes, good. Up here. Yes, good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 And I'm leaving that treat there by design to let him know, I know you want that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=181.6s	181.6	 But even though you want that, you still need to pay attention to me up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 Yes, good. And I'm letting him know it pays to pay attention. See?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 So again, I'm going to make it real tempting by moving it around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=193.6s	193.6	 Remember, dogs are really excited by things that move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=196.6s	196.6	 Leave it alone. Now eyes up here. There it is right there. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 So this is looking good. And see, the goal is to gradually work up to greater and greater distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 Right now I'm throwing treats. I can throw this package over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 I even have a book I can throw over here. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 And then all that, leave it alone. Satchmo, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 Yes, good job. And really light up when they listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 By getting his attention on me when he's distracted in small situations like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=225.6s	225.6	 it buys me time when in a real world scenario, like say at the park and a dog comes up to tell him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=231.6s	231.6	 look at me, stay or look at me, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 Or in the case of encountering a new strange person, look at me, go say hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 So you want them checking in with you at first so that you can direct them in every little situation for that first year of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=246.6s	246.6	 Let's see if we can teach Satchmo a trick. Now, I think every dog needs to know how to shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 And I was noticing that when I was training him a little earlier, he was kind of offering his paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 This is a great opportunity to now put a word to it. Shake, just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 That's called capturing a behavior. That is when they do something without you prompting them to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=265.6s	265.6	 I'm going to start being a little bit more disciplined on when I reward him too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 So let's say we only want him to use this foot for shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 Yes, shake. Good job. So I'm only going to reward when he lifts this paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=281.6s	281.6	 I'm just going to wait. You can see, oh, man, those wheels are turning. Look at his eyes right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=285.6s	285.6	 He's thinking I'd like to get the behavior many times in a row before I introduce the term shake before he does the shaking motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 Resist the urge to say, shake, shake, shake. I'm going to raise the bar even further.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 I'm not going to reward on shake unless I ask for it. Shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 Yes, good. And you'll find that if you just wait it out sometimes, if they look like they're thinking about doing it, there's a really good chance they will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=314.6s	314.6	 Clearly, Satchmo is motivated by food, but is he motivated by play? That's what we're going to find out right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=320.6s	320.6	 Oh, look at this right into it. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=323.6s	323.6	 Now, if your dog wasn't this interested in the toy right away, then you would do what you could to spark his interest by moving it around and making it exciting like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=332.6s	332.6	 Kind of a little bit of keep away at first is a really good way to entice the dog. But let him win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=337.6s	337.6	 Don't get don't make the game too hard for them at first. Look at this instantly. I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=342.6s	342.6	 The reason why the war is such a powerful currency is because most dogs instinctively like to play it and they seem to find great joy and satisfaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=350.6s	350.6	 Imagine all those neurochemicals going on in his brain right now. That joy and how that greatly intensifies his desire to play and interact with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=358.6s	358.6	 That's key when teaching a dog. But tug is only half the equation. If I'm ever to have any success with using tug of war as a training tool, he's got to be able to let go when I ask him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzQ2_Dejbk&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=367.6s	367.6	 So in order to get him to let go, we'll just make the game really boring. And when he lets go, I'm going to immediately reignite the game.
