https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=82.2s	82.2	 Communicating with a dog isn't exactly the most natural thing to them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=85.5s	85.5	 especially when they're this young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=87.5s	87.5	 We have to delicately and methodically introduce the concept of communication to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 One thing we need to communicate to you is how to stop biting, I think.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=117.1s	117.1	 He's just chomping away here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=118.6s	118.6	 Look at that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=128.5s	128.5	 This is so instinctive and natural to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 It's not very realistic to get rid of puppy biting like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 It's actually a weeks long process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 There are three major ways to address puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=139.1s	139.1	 First, place a strong emphasis on communicating to your dog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=151.8s	151.8	 Since you should be teaching your dog the difference between yes and no,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 a simple monotone no followed by restricting access to your flesh or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=159.2s	159.2	 clothing very consistently will play a big part in teaching them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 When they do get you like this, let them know when they're biting hard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 no, that hurts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=167.5s	167.5	 You know, communicate that in your own way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=169.5s	169.5	 No.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=172.5s	172.5	 Every time that you interact with them, you have to have a clear focus on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 I've got kind of a chunk of turkey in my hand and he's biting right now,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=183.2s	183.2	 In other words, that's a step in the right direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=185.7s	185.7	 So don't feel like it needs to be all or nothing with your dog too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 This will teach them how to bite more gently because again, biting in and of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=230.6s	230.6	 So I'm going to touch his ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=231.8s	231.8	 Again, another sensitive area while I'm touching his ears.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=237.7s	237.7	 We're also giving him this positive association of being touched firmly and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=252.5s	252.5	 future, a four year old child comes up to him and pulls his tail or something.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=271.4s	271.4	 like a toy is likely to satisfy the requirement to bite on something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=275.0s	275.0	 And what I like about this toy that comes with the pup box is that it has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=278.4s	278.4	 different textures that keeps puppies engaged.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=284.6s	284.6	 I want to interact with you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 And I think that's really healthy in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 So I will take a toy and I'm going to try to get his attention on this tug toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=292.6s	292.6	 right here and let him know, look, you can bite on this all day long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 Let's see if that works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=296.4s	296.4	 Sometimes it just takes a little coaxing, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=298.6s	298.6	 In other words, we don't just put it down like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=301.1s	301.1	 We want to move it around, make it exciting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=304.6s	304.6	 One of the reasons I like to go straight into tug of war with a puppy bite or two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=308.2s	308.2	 is because you're really teaching him how to play tug of war, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=311.1s	311.1	 And tug of war is a real valuable currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 Just because you do this doesn't mean he's just going to be magically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=315.5s	315.5	 attracted to the tug toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 He still may get your sleeves or your clothing from time to time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=321.1s	321.1	 And in those instances, we just want to redirect him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=324.1s	324.1	 to the thing that's OK to chew on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=325.7s	325.7	 He hasn't really bit me lately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=327.2s	327.2	 He's been focused all on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=328.6s	328.6	 This is a good thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=329.8s	329.8	 I didn't expect lunging at my face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=332.0s	332.0	 Oh, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=332.6s	332.6	 What do you suggest I do whenever he does that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=334.6s	334.6	 Because usually it's whenever we're like laying in my bed and he just like goes at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=340.2s	340.2	 When dogs get really overexcited, like they're lunging at your face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=344.4s	344.4	 you're trying to redirect them and they're having none of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 Then a brief timeout for 30 seconds to two minutes is a good idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=350.6s	350.6	 But then, you know, probably bring them out and give them an opportunity to listen again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=354.6s	354.6	 Another good thing to do is probably take them on a short walk or something like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=357.9s	357.9	 to get some of that extra energy out when they're in that really rambunctious mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=361.4s	361.4	 Now, in some cases, you don't necessarily want to rile your dog up and get him playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 In some cases, you just want to encourage calm behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=368.3s	368.3	 That's where using food instead of a toy comes into play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=372.9s	372.9	 You can see he knows I've got some turkey in this hand over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=377.2s	377.2	 I actually want to illustrate something right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=379.6s	379.6	 I'm going to give him just a tiny piece of turkey just to let him know I've got something good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=383.9s	383.9	 I want to point out something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 Watch how hard it is to get him biting now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=387.1s	387.1	 I'm actually going to egg him on a little bit and play with him and see how he...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 Do you see the biting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=392.2s	392.2	 I mean, it's almost non-existent there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 Do you know why that is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=396.6s	396.6	 That's because when a dog gets into food mode, they're like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=399.6s	399.6	 oh, I don't care about biting anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=401.0s	401.0	 I want some of that food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 I'm going to go ahead and give him another little piece there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=404.9s	404.9	 And for those of you wondering at home, is this rewarding the biting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=408.3s	408.3	 because he was just biting and you gave him a treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=410.8s	410.8	 Not in the slightest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=411.8s	411.8	 I'm not rewarding the biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=413.2s	413.2	 I'm rewarding the intermittent period of time there where he didn't bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=416.6s	416.6	 Third, redirecting your dog into a standard training session using a good treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=421.1s	421.1	 will go a long way to showing your dog how you want them to behave instead of biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=425.9s	425.9	 You can't have refrigerated meat all the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=427.8s	427.8	 so it's important to have high-value treats like this accessible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=431.0s	431.0	 so that you can easily snap into training mode when necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=434.1s	434.1	 And if you taught your dog to sit, then we'll just lure him back into a sit right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=439.4s	439.4	 So when those biting fits start consistently redirecting him into a sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=444.6s	444.6	 is a great way to get traction on the biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=448.2s	448.2	 These tricky trainer treats come with a two-month pup box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 Obviously, Linus loves them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=455.6s	455.6	 so now he's not biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=457.0s	457.0	 Right there, he's biting me, but I'm going to withdraw my hand, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=461.0s	461.0	 Maybe let's get a look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=463.5s	463.5	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=467.0s	467.0	 Yeah, there you go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=489.4s	489.4	 is such a great way to address puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=491.8s	491.8	 We've been working on lie down, but it's off and on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=501.9s	501.9	 when they're going to be in a bitey mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=503.7s	503.7	 They'll foreshadow, they'll start slow, and they can get more vigorous,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=506.7s	506.7	 so it's important for you as their person to be one step ahead of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=510.0s	510.0	 So if you've got your treats handy, which they should be everywhere throughout the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=513.8s	513.8	 when you have a dog this young, and you have some toys here and there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=517.0s	517.0	 then you ought to be able to grab them and either convert it into a play session with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=521.4s	521.4	 in order to build that bond and play with them, which is very powerful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=524.6s	524.6	 and will yield great results in future training, or redirect them into a training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=530.3s	530.3	 It's important that you not just rely on playing with a toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=533.4s	533.4	 or converting it into an obedience lesson with food.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=538.8s	538.8	 A lot of people get thrown off because it doesn't work immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=543.1s	543.1	 You have to do this hundreds of times over the next few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=546.0s	546.0	 I just try to be consistent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=547.2s	547.2	 That's the magic word.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=556.1s	556.1	 In other words, some people have small kids in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=558.2s	558.2	 If you're a parent and you have young kids, please understand that it is your responsibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=562.7s	562.7	 to manage your dog and keep them from play biting the kids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=565.8s	565.8	 It's not realistic to have young kids go through the actions that we've covered today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=569.7s	569.7	 We manage them by having them on leash, even inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=573.0s	573.0	 And a dog who bites a lot is likely to be energetic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=576.4s	576.4	 With dogs that have a lot of energy, what is it we need to do with them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=579.8s	579.8	 Exercise them!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=583.7s	583.7	 Puppy biting like this can go on until a dog is about five months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=587.0s	587.0	 It can go on much longer into adulthood if you don't address it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=590.4s	590.4	 So some level of puppy biting is pretty normal for those first few months.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEG7ci-y_I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=365&pp=iAQB&t=594.0s	594.0	 Remember, your goal isn't to eliminate it quickly.
