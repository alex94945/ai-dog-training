https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Inertia just is infatuated by this dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=3.0s	3.0	 She really likes to take a look at him every time we come out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 I want to test her in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 It's a controlled circumstance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 She's on a long lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=10.5s	10.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 Why did I say yes there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=13.3s	13.3	 Because she was reacting appropriately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 She was looking, but she was still being a good dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=18.5s	18.5	 Even if they're looking at the dog sometimes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 especially if you're fairly far along in the reactivity training process,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=25.8s	25.8	 it can be a good idea to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=27.5s	27.5	 Yes, I appreciate that you're looking at the dog and not lunging and barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=31.5s	31.5	 In a situation like that, I just really want to make sure that Inertia is under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=36.5s	36.5	 So I'm going to put her into a precautionary heel just to make sure she's right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 We're not using the leash as a communication tool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=43.5s	43.5	 We're using it as a management solution and as a safety net.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 There's no need to provide a harsh correction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 You can stop the behavior by managing, and that's step one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKsDtYoKLg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=20&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 Step two is just to train your dog what you want them to do.
