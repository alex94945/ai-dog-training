https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=30.2s	30.2	 Does your dog act kind of crazy or strange on a walk?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=32.7s	32.7	 No, I mean like really crazy and really odd.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=35.9s	35.9	 Tell me what the oddest thing your dog does in the comments below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 I had the pleasure of meeting Lafitte yesterday and he had so much energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 He's a very charismatic dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=61.8s	61.8	 How old is Lafitte?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=63.4s	63.4	 He's almost three and a half.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=64.4s	64.4	 And how long have you had him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=65.5s	65.5	 I got him when he was about six months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 So what kind of issues are you having specifically?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=69.8s	69.8	 He's very high energy when we go on walks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=71.7s	71.7	 He starts off just kind of like a tornado.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=74.2s	74.2	 He sees things like a truck or a bus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=76.8s	76.8	 Right there, there's a truck driving by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 He lunges for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=82.3s	82.3	 And he lunges for trees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 Trees, and that is what's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 What's his exercise regimen like in general?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 Well we usually start the day with a pretty long walk, like three miles at least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 Hey, hey!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 Another truck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 At least three walks a day and then maybe instead of one of those walks, like play time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 When you're playing with him off leash, for example, does he tend to exhibit this behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=101.5s	101.5	 of barking at everything or jumping on things like the trees?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=104.7s	104.7	 No, not at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=105.7s	105.7	 So it's only when on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=107.4s	107.4	 It's pretty common for him to behave this way on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=109.5s	109.5	 A lot of dogs, especially if they're an energetic type of dog, because they do what they can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 So in other words, if he were off leash, his preference might be to run around all over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 the place and get some of that energy out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=119.9s	119.9	 But since he can't do that in a city setting like this, he tends to try and get his energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 out in other ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=125.5s	125.5	 As long as you continue to exercise him more, we'll probably see a reduction of this, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 that's not the point of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 The point of this video is to show you what to do when your dog does react unfavorably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=136.5s	136.5	 How well does he do his basic obedience?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 In a high distraction environment, he's not as focused, certainly, but he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 He sits, he stays, he knows leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 And do you feel like he can do these things in an outdoor environment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=147.9s	147.9	 Before we can ask Lafitte to behave on a walk, Rachel and Lafitte need to show me that they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 got some basic communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=154.4s	154.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=156.4s	156.4	 So a nice little sit here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=157.4s	157.4	 I love that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=158.4s	158.4	 Will he do lie down when you ask?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=159.8s	159.8	 Mm-hmm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=160.8s	160.8	 He knows the hand gesture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=161.8s	161.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=162.8s	162.8	 Have you taught him how to leave turkey alone when you drop it like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=168.3s	168.3	 There's a reason for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 This is going to tell me how well he listens to you in the face of a minor distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=174.4s	174.4	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=175.4s	175.4	 And then, now ask him to look at you, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=178.5s	178.5	 Look.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=270.4s	270.4	 That's interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=271.4s	271.4	 So it's not trees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=272.4s	272.4	 So we have a squirrel now apparently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 In this case, you know, since I see he's fixated on it and we've got cars...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=281.9s	281.9	 This is a distracting...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=283.9s	283.9	 Cars everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=284.9s	284.9	 I want to see some...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=285.9s	285.9	 You want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=287.9s	287.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=288.9s	288.9	 I just wanted to see if he would take treats right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=290.9s	290.9	 There?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 Yeah, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=293.9s	293.9	 Everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=294.9s	294.9	 So what I think we need to do now, we have put ourselves in a very distracting situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=299.8s	299.8	 Okay, I've seen enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=301.4s	301.4	 Let's see if we can make some progress with Lafitte.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=304.1s	304.1	 Lafitte totally overstimulated by his environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=306.9s	306.9	 He's barking at things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=307.9s	307.9	 He's going kind of crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=309.3s	309.3	 When you see that your dog just loses it for lack of a better way of putting it, it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=313.6s	313.6	 good idea to just take a step back and approach the situation a bit slower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=317.6s	317.6	 So that's what we're going to do now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=319.3s	319.3	 Does he routinely go after this tree?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=321.4s	321.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 So this one, this is his number one stop right here when you go to walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=325.7s	325.7	 Every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=327.7s	327.7	 I know it today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=328.7s	328.7	 Just address the point of failure here, in this case, walking past the tree, and just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=330.9s	330.9	 take your time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=331.9s	331.9	 We have to show him how to be a little bit more civilized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=333.8s	333.8	 You think he's likely to jump on this tree if we walk past it again, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=337.6s	337.6	 My general game plan is to walk past that tree, and when I read it in his eyes that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=342.3s	342.3	 he's thinking about jumping on that tree, that's where I'm going to try and get his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=345.8s	345.8	 eyes on me in order to communicate to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=348.5s	348.5	 I don't want you to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=349.6s	349.6	 The idea of teaching an easily distracted or reactive dog is to get their eyes on you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=353.6s	353.6	 before their interest in the distraction becomes too intense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=357.4s	357.4	 If Lafitte indicates that he's going to lunge, I'll simply escort him promptly away from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=361.6s	361.6	 the distraction, whatever it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 So I have no idea how this is going to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=365.3s	365.3	 This is going to be my first time trying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=367.4s	367.4	 It's very important to pick your battles when you're working with a dog on something like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=371.6s	371.6	 this, because very often there are a variety of issues that you're probably frustrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=375.6s	375.6	 with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=376.6s	376.6	 Try and tackle them one at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=377.9s	377.9	 So in this case, I'll ignore the jumping, I'll ignore the biting on the leash, but I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=380.9s	380.9	 going to focus on really getting him to lay off that tree, because that's the most urgent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=385.2s	385.2	 matter that I think we need to correct here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=387.3s	387.3	 Look at me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=391.7s	391.7	 the tree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=392.7s	392.7	 Hey, that was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=393.7s	393.7	 A car just drove by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 He didn't bark at it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=399.4s	399.4	 at every car.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=964.7s	964.7	 to be instances where they're just like crazy, and they're like, I got to see what's behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=968.5s	968.5	 that fence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=969.5s	969.5	 At which time you have to make the decision to move on, then get them under control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=972.6s	972.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=973.6s	973.6	 He didn't go for the dog before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=974.6s	974.6	 He did go for the dog this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=976.1s	976.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=978.1s	978.1	 Dogs, they're not robots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=979.1s	979.1	 We can't always predict what they're going to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=980.7s	980.7	 So the next best thing to do is to get to know our dogs and bond with them and understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=984.1s	984.1	 every thought that they're thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=985.6s	985.6	 And the way to do that is to spend a lot of quality time with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=989.4s	989.4	 This is kind of the most distracting place because you have cars driving by at an intersection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=993.3s	993.3	 You have squirrels, trees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=995.8s	995.8	 Everything he loves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=996.8s	996.8	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=997.8s	997.8	 This is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=998.8s	998.8	 You can go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=999.8s	999.8	 And if you want to go into a sit, remember, yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1005.8s	1005.8	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1007.5s	1007.5	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1008.5s	1008.5	 We've come up against a really problematic tree right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1012.3s	1012.3	 So we're just going to keep trying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1014.0s	1014.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1015.0s	1015.0	 And go into a sit right there, I think is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1016.6s	1016.6	 Because you were able to get him back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1018.1s	1018.1	 That's why you don't need to go super far away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1019.9s	1019.9	 I saw him acknowledge you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1021.4s	1021.4	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1022.7s	1022.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1023.7s	1023.7	 Because if he wasn't acknowledging you at all, you would just get away from the tree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1026.3s	1026.3	 and then try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1027.3s	1027.3	 But I only have to go as far as I've got him back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1030.2s	1030.2	 So if it's right there, then we can just do it right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1032.2s	1032.2	 That's correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1033.2s	1033.2	 You want to go to the last known place of compliance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1035.6s	1035.6	 For those of you that are dealing with this, it's not always easy to be as patient and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1039.1s	1039.1	 understanding and frustration-free as Rachel is being with Lafitte right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1042.8s	1042.8	 But it will get easier with time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1044.6s	1044.6	 Just commit to practicing at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1046.0s	1046.0	 Like anything, you'll get good at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1047.7s	1047.7	 Good?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1048.7s	1048.7	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1049.7s	1049.7	 So we got that tree done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1050.7s	1050.7	 Here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1051.7s	1051.7	 We're under the same general area where he tends to get distracted a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1054.9s	1054.9	 You know, this is where the squirrels live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1057.0s	1057.0	 And he knows it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1058.0s	1058.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1059.0s	1059.0	 Come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1065.8s	1065.8	 We're down to the final stretch here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1067.3s	1067.3	 We have three more obstacles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1068.8s	1068.8	 We have a small tree, we have a telephone pole, and then we have his favorite tree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1072.9s	1072.9	 The tree on one side and the telephone pole on the other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1075.2s	1075.2	 Tree number one, put him into a sit in front of the tree, either at the tree or before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1078.5s	1078.5	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1079.5s	1079.5	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1080.5s	1080.5	 He did really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1081.5s	1081.5	 He didn't go after this tree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1082.5s	1082.5	 Here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1083.5s	1083.5	 Telephone pole and the tree, they're like right next to each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1086.0s	1086.0	 So you have to kind of do double duty here and try and walk through this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1090.3s	1090.3	 You have to be prepared for both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-VY_H_TG_Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=581&pp=iAQB&t=1091.5s	1091.5	 It's like a gauntlet.
