https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 We've got to move past this idea in dog training that it's all about the physical position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=8.2s	8.2	 of a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=9.2s	9.2	 That's what we've got to stop thinking of dog training as.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 That is so true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 It's the physical position, like are they in a tight heel or are they in a sit or a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 And that is, I think, one of the biggest disconnects right now in the dog training community is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=28.7s	28.7	 that it's like, oh, well, if dog is physically doing something, that must be a trained dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=32.8s	32.8	 When in reality, if they're suffering up here because of what might happen if they don't,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=39.7s	39.7	 then that's the big problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=41.3s	41.3	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 Not ideal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=43.3s	43.3	 Sounds working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 I'll be going over that point more as we go through this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 But obviously, I wanted to get that out for people who may watch this later so that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=50.9s	50.9	 not waiting for the standard two minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 Looks like everyone's popping in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 Really good to see you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=56.9s	56.9	 Oh, so audio is working?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=58.6s	58.6	 It is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=59.6s	59.6	 Seems to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 Let me know if not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 So we just, you know, we've been doing more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=63.9s	63.9	 We did a live the other day on Instagram.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=65.3s	65.3	 I wanted to touch base here on YouTube, really talk to you guys about your dogs, see if I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=69.5s	69.5	 can help you in any way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=71.9s	71.9	 That is my primary function after all, to help you with your dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=75.3s	75.3	 I also want you to be very aware of problematic dog training methods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=81.3s	81.3	 Excuse me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 Yeah, she's our watchdog right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=85.3s	85.3	 Her barking's got a lot better though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=86.5s	86.5	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=87.5s	87.5	 She saw a squirrel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 Yeah, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=90.4s	90.4	 Do you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=91.4s	91.4	 So, you know, it's a bit frustrating to those of us who are really in tune with a dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 emotional state during the training process and why it is any short-term benefits you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=104.1s	104.1	 get with a dog who is stressed out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 It's not worth it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=108.9s	108.9	 It causes problems later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=109.9s	109.9	 You're not doing your self-justice or your dog justice in that case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 And unfortunately, there are just too many dog trainers right now who are willing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=116.8s	116.8	 tell you to, at any cost virtually, to get your dog to shut down and call that training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 And that is not dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 So let's take some questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=127.2s	127.2	 How's inertia?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 She's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 She's asleep right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 She's sleeping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 We played Frisbee earlier today and it was pretty fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=134.1s	134.1	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=136.1s	136.1	 I have a reactive dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 How do I manage them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 Well, I love that you, I love that they use the word manage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=143.5s	143.5	 See, where other dog trainers will punish with a choke-prong or electric collar, trainers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 like me and others will focus on managing because you can stop any behavior in the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=153.7s	153.7	 like that with management, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=156.8s	156.8	 If your dog jumps on guests, if you have them for the first five minutes in a room upstairs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=161.7s	161.7	 when your guests arrive, you have prevented jumping, at which time you can go up and put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 a leash on them, walk down the stairs, have your dog sit and stay while your company is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 across the room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=172.5s	172.5	 Meanwhile, your dog is in a very good emotional state during this process if you condition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=176.3s	176.3	 them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=177.3s	177.3	 You know, they might be a bit excited, but you can work on sit and stay with a currency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 they value, whether it's a toy or a treat or something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=183.7s	183.7	 Oh, they said control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=185.4s	185.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=186.4s	186.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=187.4s	187.4	 It changed to manage in my head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=188.6s	188.6	 I guess I was reading the comment really fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=190.5s	190.5	 Well, but all that's management.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 I'm used to thinking of it that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=193.2s	193.2	 Those are all forms of management that allow you to teach your dog and connect with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=198.1s	198.1	 in an intellectual and sophisticated way that don't involve punishing with some crude blunt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 instrument like a choke prong or electric collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=209.9s	209.9	 And again, when I criticize these things, please understand it is directed at professionals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=215.2s	215.2	 advocating that the public train this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 It is not the individuals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 I have no problem with people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=221.7s	221.7	 My job is to educate, but unfortunately we're just at a point right now that the misinformation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=227.3s	227.3	 is out of control in dog training, like the worst I've ever seen it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=233.2s	233.2	 And that was, that's crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=234.2s	234.2	 You would think it would go the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=235.9s	235.9	 Okay, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=237.4s	237.4	 I got distracted training my dog for one second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 So it's on my mind every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 And I want you guys to know that we're really focused on doing our best to give you the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 best information we know how to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=246.5s	246.5	 When I come across a prong collar in the wild, how do I address it with the parent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=250.5s	250.5	 Well, I don't, I mean, I don't know that going up and honestly, most people, everyday people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=256.2s	256.2	 who have a prong collar on their dog, it's just, they use it more as a slip lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 If the dog pulls, then it kind of restricts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 Most people are not popping it, which by the way is the proper way to use a prong collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=267.3s	267.3	 One of my favorite dog training things when used properly, we have a script coming up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=271.1s	271.1	 about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=272.1s	272.1	 There's no proper way to pop a dog and punish them and call that proper communication because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=276.6s	276.6	 you're damaging the emotional state in those moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=279.4s	279.4	 That's why it's out of bounds and why it should not be advocated for by professional dog trainers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=284.3s	284.3	 I don't know that, I mean, I don't say anything to people who are wearing, who have prong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=288.8s	288.8	 collars on their dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=291.5s	291.5	 I mean, if you see someone using it very aggressively and you think abuse is happening, that's another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=297.3s	297.3	 story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=299.2s	299.2	 So anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 Gosh, whoa.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 Oh yeah, that's cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=308.6s	308.6	 A few people are asking why are we doing live on YouTube instead of Instagram.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=311.7s	311.7	 That's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=312.7s	312.7	 We do live on Instagram a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=314.1s	314.1	 Just mixing it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=315.1s	315.1	 In case some of you aren't following on Instagram.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=319.1s	319.1	 I really need help with my dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 Let me help you with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=322.0s	322.0	 What do you need help with?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 What do you need help with?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 Seriously, guys, I mean, I'm more dedicated than ever to making sure that I can help as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=329.7s	329.7	 many of you as possible right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=332.9s	332.9	 Because if you, quite frankly, if you go on YouTube and you search for dog training, it'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=337.5s	337.5	 be page two before you get to a positive dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=340.8s	340.8	 You might get a couple of my videos, but like that's the barrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=345.3s	345.3	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=346.3s	346.3	 Have you noticed that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 Yes, I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=348.3s	348.3	 You want another question?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=349.3s	349.3	 Yeah, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=350.3s	350.3	 What should I do if I have to keep my dog at home while I'm at school and no one can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=355.9s	355.9	 watch after him during that time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=358.1s	358.1	 Oh, what do you do when you leave your dog alone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=361.2s	361.2	 Yeah, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=362.2s	362.2	 So while they go to school.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=363.3s	363.3	 So what I do, like if you have to leave your dog alone for hours, one thing, my protocol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=367.8s	367.8	 basically is get up an hour earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=370.2s	370.2	 This is assuming I have an active dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=371.8s	371.8	 Maybe your dog doesn't require what I'm about to say, but you have 20 minutes earlier, whatever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 to make sure that you allow for time to give them adequate exercise and give them some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=379.8s	379.8	 quality time to start off their day, try and deplete their battery a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=385.5s	385.5	 We do that because we want them to not feel anxious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=388.3s	388.3	 Again, do you see how we're considering the dog's emotional state at every aspect of our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=392.8s	392.8	 training advice here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=394.4s	394.4	 If your dog is exercised and fulfilled internally, they're likely to not be in a stressful, frantic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=399.6s	399.6	 excited state of mind, which may manifest with things such as chewing up your furniture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=405.2s	405.2	 or other destructive behavior, hurting themselves by trying to get out of a crate, whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=409.5s	409.5	 the case may be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=410.5s	410.5	 That is why we want to exercise many dogs before leaving them alone for extended periods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=415.3s	415.3	 of time so that they feel properly and don't feel the need to dispense of excess energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=422.3s	422.3	 in the form of unwanted barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=423.9s	423.9	 Yeah, this is a related question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=426.3s	426.3	 What should we do with a hyperactive dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=428.9s	428.9	 You don't have to do super chats for us either, although it's super nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=433.6s	433.6	 That's nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=434.6s	434.6	 You guys don't, please don't feel obligated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=435.6s	435.6	 We're happy to answer your questions for free as well, but thank you so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=438.1s	438.1	 I'm not trying to make money with this chat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=440.4s	440.4	 What should we do with a hyperactive dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=442.1s	442.1	 Any reinforcement training fails in most situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=445.5s	445.5	 It seems to be a cat in a dog's body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=448.6s	448.6	 Just hyperactive?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=449.6s	449.6	 Hyperactive, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=450.6s	450.6	 And so they say their reinforcement tends to fail in most situations because their dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=453.2s	453.2	 is excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=454.2s	454.2	 Oh, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=455.2s	455.2	 That's what we call being over threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=456.5s	456.5	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=457.5s	457.5	 So this is one of the biggest problems that people have when accepting a lifestyle choice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=463.0s	463.0	 of reinforcing good behaviors and managing our dog's emotional well-being is really keeping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=471.0s	471.0	 all that in focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 Sorry, I lost my train of thought because I was thinking about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=474.7s	474.7	 Oh, that's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=475.7s	475.7	 Reinforcement training fails in most situations with my hyperactive dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=478.6s	478.6	 What should I do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=479.6s	479.6	 Well, you manage them, number one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=481.9s	481.9	 Try to avoid having them over threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=484.5s	484.5	 A moment ago, we talked about bringing down a presumably excited dog who is likely to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=490.6s	490.6	 jump on guests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=491.9s	491.9	 And we talked about how to manage them in that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=495.0s	495.0	 You could have them on leash and you can keep them away from their trigger and focus on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=499.6s	499.6	 reinforcing when they're under threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=502.2s	502.2	 But obviously, exercise early in the day offsets a tremendous amount of that excess energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=510.3s	510.3	 And that's what most people are missing with really excited dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=514.2s	514.2	 So distance from the triggers, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=518.5s	518.5	 And exercise, like you said, and time and practice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=522.0s	522.0	 Time and practice, normalizing the events so that the only time they see a person isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=526.4s	526.4	 when you have company come over, taking them out and doing screen saver training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=531.0s	531.0	 That means dedicating a couple of hours a week at minimum to going out there, showing your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=536.2s	536.2	 dog the world, just chilling and observing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=538.5s	538.5	 That goes a long way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=539.5s	539.5	 That's how we desensitize our dogs to the world and normalize things so they don't feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=544.1s	544.1	 the need to become reactive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=547.7s	547.7	 Some dogs are tougher than others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=548.7s	548.7	 I'm not going to lie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=549.9s	549.9	 But it should always be a red flag to you when you're training your dog if a trainer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=553.1s	553.1	 is telling you that you need to quell the behavior through some type of physical force,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=559.1s	559.1	 whether that be a choke chain, a prong collar, or an electric collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=562.2s	562.2	 Because what's evident about trainers like that who are abundant on YouTube is that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=565.7s	565.7	 do not know how to train without physical punishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=568.8s	568.8	 Presumably, I give them the benefit of the doubt by saying that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=572.5s	572.5	 Surely, if they knew how to eliminate it from their training, they would use positive reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=577.2s	577.2	 But usually what they say is, ah, that's not working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=579.3s	579.3	 I'm going to punishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=580.9s	580.9	 And that is where the mistake happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=583.8s	583.8	 What you do instead is you break that problem down into five or 10 smaller steps that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=588.3s	588.3	 more achievable for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=590.1s	590.1	 And when you go, if you can just swallow your pride and take a step back and break those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=594.6s	594.6	 into smaller steps, you'll climb right up that ladder super quick because every step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=598.8s	598.8	 is easy relative to the step before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=601.0s	601.0	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=602.0s	602.0	 Makes sense to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=605.0s	605.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=606.0s	606.0	 Um, what does it mean when a dog's back hair stands up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=612.0s	612.0	 Should I worry?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=613.0s	613.0	 That's called piloerection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=614.5s	614.5	 That's where their hair stands up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=617.2s	617.2	 And I mean, it seems to me, it seems to me that a dog is unsure when they do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=622.6s	622.6	 That's the best way I interpret it, but I can't know what the dog is thinking and nobody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=626.1s	626.1	 else can either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=627.7s	627.7	 So but it seems to be correlated with a dog feeling unsure, surprised and things like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=632.7s	632.7	 that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=633.7s	633.7	 And let it play out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=634.9s	634.9	 You know, if you can diffuse the situation, it's probably better if you don't encourage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=639.6s	639.6	 that hair to stay high because what is an emotional state during that time, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=644.5s	644.5	 We think that they are feeling a bit unsure about something or surprised by something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=651.6s	651.6	 So we want to let them process it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=653.2s	653.2	 And if our prior training, you know, our sit, stay, come when called and all that is really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=657.8s	657.8	 refined, we can work on calling them away from that situation in order to create distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=662.5s	662.5	 from the thing that's causing them uneasiness and lower that emotional state to a more normal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=668.6s	668.6	 level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=669.6s	669.6	 That's what we, it's invisible to so many.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=672.1s	672.1	 So that's why it's not intuitive for people to look at that first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=676.5s	676.5	 How many times have you guys heard me say focus on the relationship with your dog first?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=681.7s	681.7	 And the training takes care of itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=684.5s	684.5	 And too often we look at that the other way around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=686.8s	686.8	 Like let me get the dog trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=687.8s	687.8	 Then I can focus on a relationship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=689.6s	689.6	 So that's how it feels to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=692.8s	692.8	 I think so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=693.8s	693.8	 How am I doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=694.8s	694.8	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=695.8s	695.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=696.8s	696.8	 Timo says I watch your inertia training playlist matching the age of my puppy who's now eight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=701.1s	701.1	 months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=702.1s	702.1	 That is so cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=703.1s	703.1	 Congratulations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=704.1s	704.1	 Eight months can be a tough time for many people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=706.5s	706.5	 Yeah, that's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=707.8s	707.8	 I said cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=708.9s	708.9	 Like keep your expectations realistic when it comes to training your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=714.8s	714.8	 Don't think that you can train them in two weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=717.4s	717.4	 If you're really consistent, you can knock potty training out of the house in short order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=723.0s	723.0	 I mean, as long as you're really consistent, we can talk about potty training later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=727.5s	727.5	 But what I mean is like you're dealing with a mammal for goodness sake who has, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=736.1s	736.1	 so you can relate with them to a significant degree, I would think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=740.8s	740.8	 I mean, think about how many years it takes to gain life experience to understand something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=747.4s	747.4	 That's why I always say it takes two years to train a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=750.8s	750.8	 Maybe that's what's hurting the positive reinforcement training that we are honest about that because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=755.0s	755.0	 we say two years, not because it takes two years for them to learn the basics, but it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=758.8s	758.8	 takes two years for them to gain the life experience to know what is out there, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=764.6s	764.6	 To become familiar with this planet and its range of experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=770.2s	770.2	 So two years for you to let your guard down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=772.4s	772.4	 I mean, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=773.8s	773.8	 Maybe that's more what I mean because, I mean, you've seen and we'll take a dog for three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=776.8s	776.8	 weeks and we get them listening pretty well to the basics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=781.2s	781.2	 You had your dogs performing stunts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=783.0s	783.0	 Yeah, that's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=784.6s	784.6	 Much younger than two years, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=785.9s	785.9	 I was on the David Letterman show with Venus when she was 10 months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=789.3s	789.3	 But you didn't let your guard down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=790.6s	790.6	 I didn't let my guard down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=791.6s	791.6	 No, I mean, she was still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=793.3s	793.3	 Although she was she was pretty solid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=795.3s	795.3	 I was pretty naive at that time, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=797.0s	797.0	 So she fortunately was a great dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=799.6s	799.6	 But you know, if you let your guard down with other dogs, then that can be an issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=804.0s	804.0	 And people do that way too commonly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=806.0s	806.0	 So I'm following through for two years on that dog if I've taken on a new dog in my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=810.8s	810.8	 life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=811.8s	811.8	 Yeah, there's one thing I've learned from Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=813.3s	813.3	 It's that if you can prevent the bad things from happening, it is so much easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=818.8s	818.8	 And so putting in that time to manage is worth it in the long run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=822.7s	822.7	 Do you know what I think has contributed contributed to this dog training crisis with like social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=830.1s	830.1	 media just being dominated by choke chain, prong collar and electric collar trainers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=835.7s	835.7	 It's a hypothesis I've been playing with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=837.4s	837.4	 Like during COVID, I'm wondering because everyone went out and got a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=842.2s	842.2	 And we all know that we didn't have that much notice that the world was going to shut
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=845.5s	845.5	 down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=846.6s	846.6	 And at the beginning, we just thought it was going to be shut down for three months or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=849.2s	849.2	 something tops or a couple of weeks even.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=851.7s	851.7	 And people ran out impulsively, it seems, got dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=855.8s	855.8	 And I think some of them were myopic or short-sighted on that and are facing behavior problems now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=863.2s	863.2	 because maybe they didn't put in the time it took to train the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=866.8s	866.8	 And they're looking for these desperate quick fix methods that are everywhere on social
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=871.0s	871.0	 media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=872.0s	872.0	 And that's what I think might be contributing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=874.4s	874.4	 What do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=875.4s	875.4	 Maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=876.4s	876.4	 What do you guys think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=877.4s	877.4	 Do you guys think there's any truth to that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=879.3s	879.3	 Because pre-COVID, it wasn't like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=882.3s	882.3	 More people were willing to put in the time with their dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=889.3s	889.3	 Why don't you tell people how harmful prong collars are in public?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=893.2s	893.2	 Why wouldn't you recommend a harness or even your training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=895.5s	895.5	 Well, because for me, I'm only inside my own skin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=899.0s	899.0	 I'm a professional dog trainer and I don't have a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=903.8s	903.8	 Individuals, I give the benefit of the doubt to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=909.6s	909.6	 Some of these balanced and compulsion trainers can be very compelling with how they sell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=914.7s	914.7	 the use of these tools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=915.8s	915.8	 It doesn't hurt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=916.8s	916.8	 If used properly, it's really effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=919.8s	919.8	 And if it doesn't hurt or if it's not highly uncomfortable, then it's designed to be aversive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=925.4s	925.4	 So that's just misleading.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=928.1s	928.1	 And I think honest trainers will acknowledge that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=931.5s	931.5	 And I've seen many honest, balanced trainers agree that, yeah, that's how it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=936.4s	936.4	 For the first trainer I've heard say it takes two years to train your dog, I finally stopped

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1036.3s	1036.3	 But okay, so excitement urination.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1038.1s	1038.1	 They're excited, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1083.7s	1083.7	 they're going to be excited, maybe greet them outside first.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1113.6s	1113.6	 That is old school thinking.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1220.2s	1220.2	 back and watch the beginning of the video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1222.4s	1222.4	 Is that OK?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1341.5s	1341.5	 What happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1342.5s	1342.5	 So summarize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1343.5s	1343.5	 Okay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1354.1s	1354.1	 And they would like tips on becoming the most important person to their dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1361.3s	1361.3	 get excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1362.5s	1362.5	 Again, so let's look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1366.1s	1366.1	 There are some trainers will tell you and I'm trying to give you the alternatives because

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1371.5s	1371.5	 Some trainers will tell you that, okay, you pop on that leash until your dog shuts down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1377.7s	1377.7	 because they're excited and they need to know you're the one that they need to listen to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1382.4s	1382.4	 And you can aggressively pop a leash enough to where dog's like, fine, enough, I'll stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1386.6s	1386.6	 being excited, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1387.6s	1387.6	 I mean, they would respond emotionally very much how you as a person would because we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1392.2s	1392.2	 know those emotive systems are virtually identical between dogs and people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1396.5s	1396.5	 We are mammals.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1403.1s	1403.1	 dog to not be excited and lunge towards someone, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1408.3s	1408.3	 But what have you done to their mental state?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1410.3s	1410.3	 You've made them like hate life for a minute or hate doing the thing when they're just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1414.9s	1414.9	 trying to do something very natural.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1421.9s	1421.9	 where we just simply go to a park and hang out on a bench for an hour or walk around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1426.5s	1426.5	 you know, I don't know, 50 feet outside of a dog park if your dog's excited by dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1431.2s	1431.2	 We have to allow them to process those emotions naturally and not put them in situations where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1436.5s	1436.5	 they feel overwhelmed.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1443.3s	1443.3	 them unusual events to be excited about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1445.3s	1445.3	 So we have to normalize the world and be fair enough to our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1449.3s	1449.3	 I think a lot of what's broken in dog training culture is unreasonable expectations in periods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1455.2s	1455.2	 of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1456.2s	1456.2	 You know, like people need it done fast, but they don't realize the emotional damage that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1460.8s	1460.8	 can cause and how that gets in their way moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1465.2s	1465.2	 They will not.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=1470.5s	1470.5	 That is my problem because they should know better than that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3057.8s	3057.8	 that can be common with puppies, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3059.2s	3059.2	 You can always go to your vet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3258.1s	3258.1	 The problem with the four quadrants is you're measuring behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3262.2s	3262.2	 and if you've been able to modify it or change it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3270.2s	3270.2	 And that's why you're being too primitive and narrow-minded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3272.8s	3272.8	 You guys say that I am being close-minded.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3290.6s	3290.6	 given that in all known cases we have alternatives that don't do that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3304.7s	3304.7	 or the public who so willingly accept bad information?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3309.4s	3309.4	 And then how do you combat that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3310.9s	3310.9	 How do you teach a population to be scientifically literate?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3319.5s	3319.5	 I think it's more that the public, by the time someone searches for dog training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3327.1s	3327.1	 it's usually not because their dog is perfect and they want to prevent things from happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3332.8s	3332.8	 And so they're struggling and they're frustrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3335.1s	3335.1	 And I think when they see that illusion of compliance, that quick fix,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3338.5s	3338.5	 that dog going from biting your face to sitting there, I don't...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3344.0s	3344.0	 I think people are fooled by that and they don't realize what they're seeing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3349.2s	3349.2	 And it's a pretty big hurdle for you to educate the public about that and keep their attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3355.6s	3355.6	 It's unfortunate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3361.9s	3361.9	 What are you looking for?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3370.2s	3370.2	 When I type in dog training on YouTube, I mean, you've got one or two of my videos

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3382.2s	3382.2	 it's virtually exclusive choke, prong and electric collar training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3385.9s	3385.9	 This is not, it hasn't been like this in the past.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3395.5s	3395.5	 Keep in mind, my audience is mostly American, so I kind of cater to Americans,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3401.0s	3401.0	 but I know we have viewers all over the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3403.3s	3403.3	 But in so many countries, these dog training methods have been banned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3407.2s	3407.2	 They don't even allow you to sell these collars.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3413.2s	3413.2	 Do you think if there wasn't a scientific consensus,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3424.8s	3424.8	 have an agenda or some ideology.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3431.1s	3431.1	 I know that when I'm going to go to my audience

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3444.1s	3444.1	 So does Brie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3455.5s	3455.5	 And you realize when you get to a point, well, okay, but if they say that,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3465.4s	3465.4	 those methods are not considering a dog's emotional state first and foremost.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdULbriQ2U&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=69&pp=iAQB&t=3477.7s	3477.7	 one by one or name calling or other things.
