https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 Today you and I are going to meet Athena, the German Shepherd dog for the first time and we're going to find out what that training session looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 Hi, my name is Jade and this is my puppy Athena.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 I got Athena because I definitely looked up the German Shepherd breed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 They're very loyal working breed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 Sometimes when I give Athena a bone, she's likely to more snap or bite at me when I try and take it away from her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 It's especially when other pets are around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Zach, I would like you to help me when I give Athena a bone to take it away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 I'm going to help Athena work on resource guarding, getting her to stop taking treats too rough and see if we can get her to listen more reliably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 I give her a bone and when I go to take away from her, I definitely believe she would snap at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Obviously, I'm not doing my job very well if I put myself or you in a position to get snapped at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 Really what's key in this situation is to go really slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 I think we can make a lot of progress on this today because she's very young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 It's a normal behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 I can show you how to at least handle it when it does happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 So my game plan here is to start with something that's not so valuable, maybe like a plastic bone and see if I can take that from her first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 And then we'll see if I can work up to taking something even more valuable from her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 You know, something like a real animal bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 You wouldn't feel confident taking that bone from her at all right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 OK, I'm not going to go in there and take a bone from her because I don't know how she's going to react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 But sometimes you've got to get something away from your dog and you want to do it safely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 Here's a trick. I got treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 I'm going to give her the bone, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 I'm going to let her enjoy it for a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 I took it back, but I didn't just say you can never have that again because this is acceptable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 That one I'm going to get a little farther away there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 There you go. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 And it's also quite healthy there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 Have her chew on it while you're holding it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 So it's kind of like your sharing possession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 I'm seeing pretty normal signs that she's being OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 I feel really good that she's doing well here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 I mean, this is all very normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 Why don't we give her a better tasting bone and see how that goes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 Now, if Athena gets this, I'm guessing she's going to be a bit more protective of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 My goal here is to be able to give her this bone and take it away, really have her react well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 There you go. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 Athena, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 So I can't call her off of the bone right now because she's really into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 I was able to take it away there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 That's what I'm trying to have happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 I'm going to give it right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 And so right now she's being quite good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 The hypothesis here is that if she doesn't think you're going to take it away and keep it forever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 she's likely to react well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 Not to mention, we're surrounding her chewing the bone with, hey, you get a treat sometimes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 which is a positive outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=223.0s	223.0	 That's enjoyable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 So this is a really good example of counter conditioning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 Again, reversing the reaction that she typically has when you take a bone of being protective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 So right now I'm working up to taking the bone directly from her mouth as she's chewing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 without having to lure her away with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 And see how my hand, I'm going to touching it right here and desensitizing her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 So she's getting very used to seeing my hand come in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 Nothing bad's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 I'm going real slow just to read any changes in her body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 I'm looking to see if she freezes up or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 There we go. Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 That's the first time I've been able to pick the bone up without getting her away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 I wouldn't have expected that at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 But so far she has no reason to think that the bone's going to go away forever,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 though she's being very cooperative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 I can't tell you how many dog trainers out there would throw a shock collar on a dog in this situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 or a choke chain on them and just intimidate the heck out of them to break this behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 But when you try to create fear or intimidate a dog like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=280.0s	280.0	 you're very likely to make the issue worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 So it's important to just handle this intelligently with our 21st century brains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 Understand that this behavior is instinctive and we just need to show them how to behave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 Really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 And you have another dog in your house?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=293.0s	293.0	 Okay, tell me about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 How are they getting along?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 It's like an angry sister relationship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 She'll egg her on, kind of nip it in Ginger's feet to try and get her to play with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=304.0s	304.0	 Have they gotten into altercations yet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 They have, but only with treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=308.0s	308.0	 By treats you mean like a bone or a toy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=310.0s	310.0	 Like a bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 If I give Athena a bone and I give Ginger a bone, if Athena finishes hers first, she will go after Ginger's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=318.0s	318.0	 She pins Ginger down, the back of her hair kind of like flares up and she like lunges to bite at her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 Oh boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 Is it pretty recent that that's happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 For like the past month and a half.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 That's about the age where you start to see this type of behavior emerging if it's going to, and it is a bit concerning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=333.0s	333.0	 Typically dogs, say under the age of four months, they're not actually aggressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 I mean, you'll have rambunctious puppy biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=338.0s	338.0	 However, once dogs hit around five months of age, maybe six months, if you're going to see it, you often start to see it emerge around that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 And so while it's true that you can have a really intense puppy biter, there is a huge difference between puppy biting that's related to teething and grabbing things and a dog actually aggressively snapping at another animal or person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=359.0s	359.0	 Extensive management is going to be required for the next year or two on your part to really minimize those instances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=365.0s	365.0	 And by management, I mean having her on leash, not having unrestricted access to your other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=370.0s	370.0	 That's really important because she's got a lot to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 The younger dog is the worse their impulse control is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 That's how you manage that situation, but that's only half the equation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=378.0s	378.0	 In order to actually hopefully work towards them getting along, have your other dog either at a crate or on leash so you can really work with her on these types of exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 Because again, you're just trying to desensitize her and let her know, look, these things happen all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=391.0s	391.0	 It shouldn't be a special occurrence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 You shouldn't feel protective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=394.0s	394.0	 You're going to get what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 Between doing that and really managing, that's how you're going to get to where you want to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 Let me see you work with her if you don't mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=401.0s	401.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=403.0s	403.0	 Nina.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=406.0s	406.0	 So funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=408.0s	408.0	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 All right, so it took a few attempts there to get her to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=410.0s	410.0	 And why do you think that is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=411.0s	411.0	 There's a lot of distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=412.0s	412.0	 Every time you change an environment on a dog, you can expect them to be like, whoa, what's happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=417.0s	417.0	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=419.0s	419.0	 Oftentimes people try to wean their dog off of treats way too early.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=422.0s	422.0	 And so it's really important to be generous with your rewards that first year of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=426.0s	426.0	 If you are having trouble getting her to be reliable in new places, especially, you want to be ultra liberal with your rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=431.0s	431.0	 Now, it doesn't mean big treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=432.0s	432.0	 It just means lots of small, good treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=434.0s	434.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=435.0s	435.0	 Ooh, boy, she takes treats kind of hard, huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=438.0s	438.0	 So let's talk about briefly how to resolve that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 It's very, again, normal for young puppies to take treats rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=442.0s	442.0	 But see what I'm doing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 I've got a high value treat, but I'm just going to let her lick on it right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=446.0s	446.0	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=447.0s	447.0	 You see how she's licking when I have a firm grip on it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=449.0s	449.0	 She's nibbling a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=450.0s	450.0	 That licking, I'm going to go ahead and reward that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 Now she's licking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=452.0s	452.0	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=453.0s	453.0	 So I'm going to release the treat when she licks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=455.0s	455.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=456.0s	456.0	 In other words, it's kind of a gradual process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=458.0s	458.0	 Right there, she's taking her teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=459.0s	459.0	 That's not working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=460.0s	460.0	 The licking works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=461.0s	461.0	 That's what I'm trying to teach her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=462.0s	462.0	 When you lick, you get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=464.0s	464.0	 When you bite, you don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=466.0s	466.0	 In the meantime, though, while they're getting into the habit, if you must treat them and they're still taking treats too rough, open palm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 Pretty hard for them to bite when it's open palm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_EUuv7q1k&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=474.0s	474.0	 These Puppet treats are perfect for this type of training.
