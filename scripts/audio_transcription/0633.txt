https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 the same time that you do when you're playing fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=10.3s	10.3	 So we're going to try and apply leave it to this situation, which is a little different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=14.8s	14.8	 because normally when we teach leave it, we're trying it with treats, but now we're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 to do it with the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 He likes to obviously go after the tennis ball here, but he has this habit of often
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=24.5s	24.5	 going for it the moment a person comes in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=27.1s	27.1	 No, don't touch that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 Don't touch that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=29.6s	29.6	 I'm going to pick that up and we're going to create a barrier here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=32.8s	32.8	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=37.8s	37.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 And the second we get compliance, I'm going to give him that ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=41.3s	41.3	 Wait, I mean, yeah, he's no, he's figured it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 In general, you can do leave it with a ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 You can do it with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=52.4s	52.4	 When they learn the concept of leave it, they can do so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=55.8s	55.8	 Why don't you try it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=56.8s	56.8	 The temptation is to try and beat him too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 We're trying to break that habit of him getting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=62.3s	62.3	 Just wait it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=63.3s	63.3	 Don't be in a hurry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=64.3s	64.3	 Your attitude is I got all day long and I'll pick it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 But if he goes for it and then you back off, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=68.7s	68.7	 And just back off there for five seconds, 10 seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=70.6s	70.6	 Be like, no, I'm not going to pick it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=72.5s	72.5	 I'm not in a hurry to get this ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=73.7s	73.7	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=77.5s	77.5	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 And there's the reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 That's how you teach a border collie to leave a tennis ball alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj1vqRkgZQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=634&pp=iAQB&t=96.7s	96.7	 That has to be the most specific dog training video I've ever made.
