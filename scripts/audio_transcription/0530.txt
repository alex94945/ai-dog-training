https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 If your dog is less than perfect on a walk, today I'm going to show you two things you need to do to teach your dog to walk flawlessly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 Today's video is sponsored by PEP Club.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 Click thumbs up for a leash walking video with Jacob, and while you're at it, click subscribe too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=20.5s	20.5	 Today we're going to attempt to teach Jacob how to walk nicely on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 With high energy dogs, it's imperative that you get their energy out of them before expecting them to retain intricate concepts like walking nicely on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=34.5s	34.5	 By changing the way you buy dog food, you continue to help us change the way people teach dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 You know, I've been having my food automatically shipped to me for years now, and I really can't express how convenient it's made my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 Just go to petflow.com slash Zach George, choose your favorite food that you're going to get anyway, and how often you want it to arrive at your house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=53.5s	53.5	 That's really all there is to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 I'll have a special link in a coupon code in the description of this video that will give you 20% off of your first auto ship order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 Most people wait to work with their dogs on their leash manners when they're on their normal walks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 So naturally, our patience is likely to be a little bit diminished when we're trying to do two things at once, like get somewhere and also train our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 Commit to working with your dog when you have sufficient time and you're feeling extra patient with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 It takes some significant effort on your dog's part to grasp this concept of walking slowly and staying near you while they're on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 See, dogs walk faster than we do, so this is pretty unnatural to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 Dogs like Jacob are the product of thousands of years of selective breeding for traits like stamina, endurance, and strength.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=95.5s	95.5	 But dogs are also optimized to take directions specifically from people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=100.5s	100.5	 In order to be successful at teaching your dog to walk on a leash nicely though, you must be able to get their attention on you at will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 But how do you do that in an exciting place like a neighborhood with lots of smells and distractions?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 The treats I'm using today are tiny pieces of real chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 Always go for quality over quantity when it comes to treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=119.5s	119.5	 Sit. Look at me. Good boy. Very, very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 See, I don't want to just start taking off into a brisk walk down the street and then hope that he's going to pay attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 If your dog won't pay attention to you here, right in front of your house, well, they're not likely to pay attention to you when they encounter any type of minor distraction as you proceed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 So let's get this really solid first. Yes. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 So I'm happy that Jacob can do a basic look at me right in front of the house here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=146.5s	146.5	 So let's take this to the next level. Let's start walking with him. Up here. Good. Really good. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=152.5s	152.5	 I want Jacob thinking of this as a me you experience up here. Yes. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=159.5s	159.5	 See, I'm practicing getting his attention on me whenever I ask for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 Now, this isn't to suggest that your dog should pay attention to you all the time when you're on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=167.5s	167.5	 But when you ask for it, you ought to be able to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=170.5s	170.5	 The real magic in dog training is when you can accomplish meaningful communication eye to eye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 So proud of you doing a good job. Look at this. No tension.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=178.5s	178.5	 Jacob is starting to get a little distracted by a ground scent there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=181.5s	181.5	 So let me see if I can get his attention on me. Again, still right here in a very familiar place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=185.5s	185.5	 Jacob, up here. Look at me. Yes. Excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 I'm even going to give him a little bit of an extra reward because he's a little bit, you know, in and out right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=193.5s	193.5	 So I want to try and solidify that communication to get those eyes on me voluntarily. That is the key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=199.5s	199.5	 Ultimately, at the end of the day, a dog like Jacob loves getting out and exploring the world he lives in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=204.5s	204.5	 The treats simply help me keep his attention on me while I teach him how to look at me whenever I ask.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=209.5s	209.5	 Moving forward, though, with most dogs, the walk itself will serve as the reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=213.5s	213.5	 Jacob is interested in something on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=215.5s	215.5	 Many people have the instinct to just pull their dog until they stop sniffing at the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=219.5s	219.5	 But let me show you what you can do here instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=221.5s	221.5	 I'm going to use the treat. We're competing with a lot of distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=224.5s	224.5	 Here we go. Jacob, come here. Come on. I'm going to stick with him here. Come on. Hey, Jacob. Yes. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=231.5s	231.5	 Right there. There you go. Jacob's doing terrific. It's time to move on to our next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=236.5s	236.5	 Now, remember, adjust your mindset because your goal isn't to get somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=240.5s	240.5	 In this case, your goal should simply be to get your dog to pay attention to you outside of the house while on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=246.5s	246.5	 That is it. Instead of just asking Jacob to look at me, though, as I make my way down the street,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=251.5s	251.5	 I'm going to test for compliance by asking him to do things like sit and lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=256.5s	256.5	 This is a fantastic way to measure how willing your dog is to listen to you at any given moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=263.5s	263.5	 If they won't do something they know here, well, they're certainly not going to do anything they don't know there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 If your dog isn't listening to these basic skills that they would normally do at home really well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=274.5s	274.5	 this probably means you've thrown them in the deep end and you're asking them to do a little bit too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=278.5s	278.5	 And you need to work up to that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=280.5s	280.5	 Less familiar equals more interesting to most dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=284.5s	284.5	 Be empathetic to that point. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=286.5s	286.5	 So we're going to go on a walk now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=288.5s	288.5	 It'll let him think that we're just taking a stroll.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=290.5s	290.5	 There's a little tension here. I don't really like that too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=293.5s	293.5	 So I'm going to try and get his attention on me rather than the environment that he's trying to pull towards up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=298.5s	298.5	 See a little bit more challenging now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=300.5s	300.5	 This is normal because we I mean, just a few feet away from the house is a completely new environment to many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=306.5s	306.5	 And he wants to get out there and explore things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=308.5s	308.5	 I understand that. Jacob. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=311.5s	311.5	 He gave me a glance there. I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=313.5s	313.5	 Come here, Jacob.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=315.5s	315.5	 Yeah, good boy. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=317.5s	317.5	 All right. Ready? Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=319.5s	319.5	 Nice. I'll take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=321.5s	321.5	 Jacob, up here. I don't have his attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=323.5s	323.5	 He didn't look at me when I asked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=325.5s	325.5	 I'm not going to continue to proceed until I can confirm that he'll pay attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 Hey, Jacob, look at me. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=331.5s	331.5	 Good. Will you sit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=333.5s	333.5	 He's thinking about pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=335.5s	335.5	 Jacob, come here. And you know, with your own dog, you'll start to see that and you'll be able to detect when they're thinking about pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=341.5s	341.5	 That's the time to address this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=342.5s	342.5	 You can hear a barking dog in the background right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=344.5s	344.5	 You know, that's that's a distraction to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=346.5s	346.5	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=348.5s	348.5	 That tells me he's compliant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=350.5s	350.5	 He's willing to listen to me so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=352.5s	352.5	 So let's keep going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=353.5s	353.5	 All right. So right here, I don't like how he's really focused on that dog right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=357.5s	357.5	 So again, I'm going to take the time to get his attention back on me so that I can guide him more appropriately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=362.5s	362.5	 Jacob, come here. Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=364.5s	364.5	 Good job. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=366.5s	366.5	 Good. Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=368.5s	368.5	 Good work. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=370.5s	370.5	 So that was a major victory right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=372.5s	372.5	 When you're not able to get their attention on you, you get away from the distraction until they are compliant again and then proceed slowly testing often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0bYJANdmbY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=531&pp=iAQB&t=380.5s	380.5	 If you can't get away from the distraction, just wait it out, calmly restrain them until you're able to move on and keep practicing until your dog improves.
