https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 Precious and Grigio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=30.5s	30.5	 Hi, my name is Rachel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 I am Zach's associate producer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=33.9s	33.9	 And I have 10 personal dogs and 4 foster dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 This is my dog Grigio, and he's my personal dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=41.1s	41.1	 And this is Precious. She is one of my 4 foster dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 After I brought Precious home to foster, she was diagnosed with Cushing's disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 And that means she has to take meds every day for the rest of her life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 Most of the dachshunds that I foster are medical fosters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=56.9s	56.9	 So they have to get medicine pretty much every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=59.6s	59.6	 One of the side effects of Cushing's disease is that you gain a lot of weight if it's not medically managed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=64.3s	64.3	 She's actually lost 12 pounds since I've been fostering her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=67.5s	67.5	 So we wrapped their pills in treats, but a lot of them bite our hands so hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=71.6s	71.6	 because they're super excited about the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=73.2s	73.2	 And it really hurts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=74.6s	74.6	 Even my husband is scared of these little dachshunds at pill time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=77.7s	77.7	 Zach, please help me get these dogs taking treats nicely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=81.2s	81.2	 Oh, you guys don't look so bad. You look pretty polite to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=83.9s	83.9	 Let's see if you take treats too rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 Let's see about Precious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=91.1s	91.1	 Right on my nail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=91.9s	91.9	 There's a little mark there. Not too bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 I'd prefer to have no marks, Precious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 You guys definitely take treats too roughly, especially you, Precious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=99.8s	99.8	 Let's see if we can get you guys taking treats like nice dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=102.4s	102.4	 One of the perks of my job is that I get really great access to some of the most cutting edge dog foods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 This is Stella and Chewy's Super Beef Meal Mixers with dog food like this, which is really high in meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=113.2s	113.2	 Sometimes you can get by with using them for primary treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=115.6s	115.6	 because they're a high enough value treat to the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=118.9s	118.9	 If you took treats nicer, you'd probably get more of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 Sorry, I don't speak dachshund.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=123.2s	123.2	 That is real freeze dried meat and organic fruits and veggies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 The closer food stay to their natural state, the better they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 This is a fantastic way to add that raw, nutrient rich meat to your dog's diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 It even comes with a scoop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=136.3s	136.3	 And if your dog's a picky eater, which you guys are obviously not, these are fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=140.8s	140.8	 You can get your Stella and Chewy's Meal Mixers from Petho
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=143.3s	143.3	 have them automatically shipped to you so they're always there when you need them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=145.9s	145.9	 Enter code ZACH30 when you check out and you'll get $10 off your first three orders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=150.2s	150.2	 Since I'm lucky enough to have two different dogs here today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=152.7s	152.7	 I'm going to show you two different ways to approach this problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=155.6s	155.6	 Now, Precious over here, she's really extra rough when she takes treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=159.7s	159.7	 Although Grigio, he's still far from polite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 All right, Precious, let's go put you up so I can work with your brother.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=165.1s	165.1	 Come on. With Grigio, I'm going to hold the treat really tight like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=168.9s	168.9	 and I'm going to let him nibble on the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 But I'm not going to release that treat completely until he either starts nibbling a little bit more politely or he starts licking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=178.3s	178.3	 See, both of those things are indicators that he's on the right track to learning how to take treats in a more civilized manner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=184.1s	184.1	 All right, here's a tiny one. Can you take it nicely?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=187.2s	187.2	 Look at that. And there's my whole finger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=189.1s	189.1	 Now, let's see how you do with Turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 Good boy. And look, you can see he's taking it super, super gently right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 Look at that. All right, Grigio, you're easy, but let's see what we can do with your foster sister, Precious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=204.2s	204.2	 Precious, she's famous for snatching treats very vigorously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 So I'm going to take a little bit of a different approach than I did with Grigio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=210.8s	210.8	 See, with Precious, I don't want to sit here and let her gently bite on my fingers because I don't have a lot of confidence that she's going to gently do anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 Instead, I'm not going to give her the treat at all until she indicates that she's going to take it nicely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=224.9s	224.9	 So how do you do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 Well, you'll find that if you just slow down your pace a little bit, that your dog will probably pick up this skill pretty quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 So she goes for the treat too over enthusiastically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 I'm just going to pull the treat away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=236.9s	236.9	 Just the act of going slow and making a dedicated training session out of teaching your dog to take treats nicely is likely to help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=245.7s	245.7	 Easy. That's too rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 Teaching your dog to take a treat nicely is a wonderful opportunity to really refine your communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=253.1s	253.1	 Good. Yes, that was a good one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=254.6s	254.6	 She took it really nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=255.7s	255.7	 Yes. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 Right there. She's starting to lick already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=259.2s	259.2	 Let's make sure that our training is doing well with a variety of different rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=262.8s	262.8	 I'm going to use some real turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=264.2s	264.2	 That was too rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=270.2s	270.2	 Not bad. Definitely an improvement for sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 I'm able to let her now start to nibble on that treat without her biting too hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=276.8s	276.8	 Look at that. Still got five fingers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=278.9s	278.9	 Just a few minutes ago, there's no way I would have put fingers with food in them this close to her mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 This is one of those things that you can very quickly resolve if you just commit to giving some attention to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 These two also have a pattern of getting a bit more competitive when there's one person with a treat and they're not the only dog around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 Let's see if we can give you guys both a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 And good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=301.0s	301.0	 Yes. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 Easy, honey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 I'm just going to let you lick on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=313.7s	313.7	 Greasy-o. What are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=315.7s	315.7	 If your dog is an extreme case, a couple of things you can do in the meantime are to treat them open palm like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jW-VkBm904&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=480&pp=iAQB&t=321.7s	321.7	 You'll find that dogs tend to take treats more gently that way.
