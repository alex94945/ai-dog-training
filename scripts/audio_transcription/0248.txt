As of now there's no expiration date on that series. But dog training in its purest form is understanding the individual dog that you're working with. I know there are literally millions of you out there who have different dogs with different energy levels, different personalities and just different issues. This is Kona and I have three weeks to work with her for her new family who happens to be my editor, Tristan.

It's clear to me that you guys are really enjoying these deep dives into training an individual dog over a period of time. And that's what's led us to this completely new series concept that is taking a variety of different dogs and working with them over an extended period of time so that you might be able to get a sense of how to work with your individual dog. So the idea with this particular dog Kona is that I want to show you how to get through those first few critical weeks because it's been my experience.

After all, having a new puppy is extremely overwhelming. We really want to test this series out. Do you guys like the concept of taking a dog for several weeks and doing a deep dive into how we train them during that time? Our next episode is going to be posted Sunday, October 25th at 12 noon Eastern. The only thing that's really left is for us to come up with a new dog.

Tell me in the comments what you think. I can't wait to hear what you guys think of the first episode. It's pretty wild one. That's for sure. You know, you're not as easy to train as you are cute. I'm Zach George. I'm a dog trainer. Meet my new project Kona. I've got just three weeks to trainer and set her up for the most well behaved life possible. That means I need to work on the most common puppy issues like potty training, how to actually pay attention, stopping things like play biting, chewing, separation anxiety,

Real dog training doesn't always go smoothly. And that's why I'm going to show you every success and mistake and how I work through all the most challenging parts of raising a new puppy. Welcome to insert title here.
