https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Great dogs are everywhere. As long as you're committed, you can teach virtually any dog, anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 We're driving the Fiesta to Animal Rescue New Orleans and we are going to see if we can work with a dog just straight up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 We're just going to pick a dog and see if we can teach him or her some cool stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=18.3s	18.3	 Part of teaching a dog is having that initial existing communication with them so that you can like really break through to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=24.5s	24.5	 And that's what we're going to focus on establishing today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 My goal is to show you how easy it can be to teach a dog that's never had any training at all or minimal training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=34.7s	34.7	 Right now we're here at the shelter. We're going to go pick out a dog and see what we can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 Fingers crossed. It'll be fun. This is always an adventure. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=42.9s	42.9	 They just want interaction. That's really all they want. Look at this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=47.4s	47.4	 What's this dog's name? Starski. Starski. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 Oh, good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 We're going to work with Starski and see if we can get him to do some basic stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 The first thing to do is to let your dog acclimate to an environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 You don't just want to throw them into an area and then expect them to just magically do well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=65.7s	65.7	 It's important to be very understanding that our dogs need to adjust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 The same is really true with us too as people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=70.6s	70.6	 We have to adjust to new surroundings when we go to a new place as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=74.2s	74.2	 I've never met Starski before, so I'm going to try and introduce myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 I'm going to offer my hand. Let him check me out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 I like to lure them into various positions just to get them comfortable with working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 Look at this. Yes. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=87.9s	87.9	 I'm saying yes to let him know that I like that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=91.5s	91.5	 Look at this. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=95.5s	95.5	 He's almost lying down. Did you see his foot go like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 That was really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=101.5s	101.5	 Lie down. You are so smart. Can I have your paw?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 Look at this. Sit. Very nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 What do you think about watch me? Let's see if we can get him to look at us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=112.9s	112.9	 Look at me. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 Now obviously whenever you're working with a dog that you don't know, you don't want to just crowd their space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 You want to be very smart and cautious about that, but he's showing no signs of being uncomfortable by eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=126.2s	126.2	 In fact, he seems to favor it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=128.6s	128.6	 Look at me. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 That's nice. Just because dogs can't talk doesn't mean they can't communicate with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=135.3s	135.3	 He's a very telling example of that, isn't he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=139.1s	139.1	 Up. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=141.8s	141.8	 Down. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=144.2s	144.2	 Back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=146.3s	146.3	 Yes. Can I have your foot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=148.7s	148.7	 Look at that. That's fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=150.4s	150.4	 He's a bright dog. Do you have a more hyper dog maybe?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 So often dogs like this are misunderstood because all people see is a high energy dog who wants to do stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 And we as people tend to get really annoyed by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=163.1s	163.1	 But honestly, you should look at the glass half full. Dogs like this are the most teachable in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 So my goal right now with Bill is to just see if I can get him playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 Yes. He grabbed that right away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=174.2s	174.2	 Notice how they lose interest though the moment a human being stops playing with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 They just let go of it. They're not interested anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=180.2s	180.2	 Remember dogs like to engage people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=181.8s	181.8	 They like to work with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=183.6s	183.6	 The way to introduce a toy is to make it fun and interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=186.9s	186.9	 Tug of War is the foundation of teaching a dog how to play fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 It can be used as a currency because this is fun for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=193.1s	193.1	 You can hear that. That's a playground you hear right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 We're going to see if we can get Archie maybe interested in a ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=198.2s	198.2	 I don't know. I've never met Archie. We want to find out what makes him tick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=200.7s	200.7	 We want to find out what his currency is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=202.9s	202.9	 What is this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=204.5s	204.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 Yes. What is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=208.5s	208.5	 A great way to get your dog interested in the toy is to play keep away with it too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 Let him think they can get it, but then keep it from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=218.7s	218.7	 Yeah. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=220.4s	220.4	 Good dog. Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 He picked it up, but I'm not going to insist that he picks it up and bring it to me right off the bat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=225.7s	225.7	 I just want to let him know I like that. Hello. Hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=228.7s	228.7	 It is nice to meet you. You are a beautiful puppy. You know that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 You're a good looking dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=234.9s	234.9	 Sit. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=236.3s	236.3	 One, two, three, four, five, six.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=240.2s	240.2	 I'm going to see if I can get him to come to me when I call him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=242.7s	242.7	 After all, that's a very important skill that all dogs need to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 That is the opposite of come Archie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 Archie! Hey!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=250.5s	250.5	 Come on. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 The key to getting a dog to come to you is to be exciting and to have a good currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=255.4s	255.4	 In this case, I'm using real meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 So let's try. Sit, stay, and come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 Sit. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=262.1s	262.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=263.9s	263.9	 Come on. Let's go. Yes. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 That's how it starts. It's really that simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=268.4s	268.4	 This is Kaia. Kaia is the longest resident here at Animal Rescue New Orleans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=273.4s	273.4	 And she's been here four and a half years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=275.4s	275.4	 We're going to see if we can work with her on proper walking on a leash without pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=279.9s	279.9	 So many people get discouraged because their dogs pull on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=282.4s	282.4	 Remember, dogs pull on a leash because they just walk faster than we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=285.8s	285.8	 So we should be empathetic and understanding to that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=288.2s	288.2	 But we want to motivate them to listen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=289.6s	289.6	 So let's give it a shot. Part of the secret to teaching a dog to walk well on a leash is to keep them guessing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=294.9s	294.9	 You have to have them check in with you to see where the walk is headed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=298.4s	298.4	 This way. Come on, girl. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=300.8s	300.8	 Come on. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=303.5s	303.5	 So we're walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=305.2s	305.2	 Sit. Look at that. Sit the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=307.7s	307.7	 Come on. This way. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=308.9s	308.9	 So we're going to continue to walk with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB5w4DdH3FI&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=598&pp=iAQB&t=310.8s	310.8	 And you can see how attentive she is.
