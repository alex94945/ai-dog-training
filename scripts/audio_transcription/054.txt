https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Okay, so I posted an episode recently where my dog, Inertia, almost did not come back to me when I called her in an uncontrolled off-leash setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=8.9s	8.9	 And this led many viewers to ask me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=11.2s	11.2	 Zach, what would you have done had she not come back to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 I thought it was a good question and one that I wanted to address outside of just a YouTube comment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 I want to give you my perspective on this as well as giving you some additional tips that might improve your dog's recall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=25.5s	25.5	 Come!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 Good girl!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=29.6s	29.6	 We were giving the dogs another round of exercise and I threw the ball pretty far and noticed that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 Inertia was pretty much dead center between me and her mom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=38.9s	38.9	 And she started to look at mom and Veronica as if to say, I think I'll go over there with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=42.9s	42.9	 But that would be a conflict because we've worked very hard at a developed game of fetch where there are structured rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=48.2s	48.2	 I want to know that she's going to be reliable and not distracted, even if by her own family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=54.2s	54.2	 Slightly confusing situation there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 I wouldn't want Inertia in this uncontrolled environment like this to go running after them, even though that's her mom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 Let's try that again just to make sure that Inertia understands coming to me is what I want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 Even when her mom's way down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=67.7s	67.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 So you can see Bree in the...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=72.8s	72.8	 Come!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=74.1s	74.1	 She gives her a look, so I do need to remind her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=78.7s	78.7	 So it's a little...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 I'd like to improve that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=81.1s	81.1	 Throw it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=83.1s	83.1	 Come!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 She's giving her a look every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 Go!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 All right, so does she look at her mom?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=92.1s	92.1	 She gave her a glance, but came right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=94.3s	94.3	 So I think that'll go a long way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 This isn't something that's taught overnight, obviously, but having a strong foundation using positive reinforcement training and such a solid foundation and basic obedience and training is really what has helped me build confidence that my dog is extremely likely to come back to me when off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 In a nutshell, my protocol for teaching dogs how to listen off leash are to seek out fenced environments and use a long lead in order to build this kind of reliability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=123.6s	123.6	 This history has informed my decision to have my dog off leash in this setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=128.4s	128.4	 It's worth mentioning that by focusing on having that deep connection and that mutual trust with my dog that I haven't felt the need to rely on superficial collars like electric collars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 To make sure that my dogs are ready for the real world, I continually introduce both artificial distractions and natural distractions that I know are going to be there as well as snapping into training mode when an unforeseen distraction happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 Inears has just spotted another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 So I'm seeing a great opportunity to practice getting her more focused while in the presence of other dogs over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 Looks like I've got her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 Hey, you want to play frisbee?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 Come around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=164.2s	164.2	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=164.7s	164.7	 Go!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=165.5s	165.5	 So I was able to get her attention off the dog onto me to play frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=168.3s	168.3	 That's always good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 Let's see if this continues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=170.1s	170.1	 I'm going to deliberately play at close range to these other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 She hasn't forgotten about the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=175.2s	175.2	 You know, she's still keeping track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=176.9s	176.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=178.7s	178.7	 Come around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=180.2s	180.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=181.1s	181.1	 Go!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=181.6s	181.6	 It's one of the reasons I like activities like fetch and frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=184.6s	184.6	 It gives them that outlet of running and chasing and jumping and biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 All that kind of fun stuff they like to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=189.5s	189.5	 And again, another great opportunity to practice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=191.8s	191.8	 Come!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=192.3s	192.3	 So Inertia in particular has gained a ton of experience of listening to me while in a distracted mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 Some of the distractions I set up, some of them I'm able to kind of control that happen in the real world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=203.6s	203.6	 and others just happen and I have to snap into training mode to make sure that she listens to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=208.5s	208.5	 And Inertia is used to all of those types of training methods,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=211.9s	211.9	 which are what I'm falling back on if she doesn't listen to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=214.8s	214.8	 Another possible strategy would be to ask Inertia to stay at a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 So maybe she's distracted by something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=221.7s	221.7	 And since we have practiced so much, stay at a distance while she evaluates a distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=227.5s	227.5	 Because we're not just jumping into this cold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=229.6s	229.6	 So it acts as a bit of a compromise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=231.2s	231.2	 Like come, she's not coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=233.2s	233.2	 So I can at least say stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=235.2s	235.2	 And I know that that communication is pretty strong and likely to be somewhat effective as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=239.3s	239.3	 So strengthening your dog's stay with distance, duration, and distractions in various environments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=244.8s	244.8	 in order to prove that skill is also really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=248.6s	248.6	 You can see how working on things like this five minutes at a time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=251.3s	251.3	 five seconds at a time can be very effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 And that cumulative experience is what makes it extremely likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=259.9s	259.9	 that my dog is going to come to me when I call her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 As much as I don't advise the use of an electric collar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=265.2s	265.2	 it's worth mentioning that if you're relying on that to make sure that your dog doesn't get away from you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 or for use in an emergency situation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 you probably shouldn't have them off leash in the first place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=276.4s	276.4	 I think that provides a false sense of security knowing that the collars can malfunction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=280.1s	280.1	 or a dog can simply ignore the collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=282.3s	282.3	 Not to mention that you have to go through the process of shocking a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=285.5s	285.5	 to get them used to the collar in the first place,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=287.5s	287.5	 which is something that I choose not to do with my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=289.9s	289.9	 Also during fetch training, the context that we were watching here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 my dog is becoming naturally fatigued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 And that makes her a lot easier to approach and to manage in off leash situations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=300.4s	300.4	 because that energy level is usually significantly depleted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=304.2s	304.2	 So in my estimation, the probability of her not listening to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=307.5s	307.5	 at the beginning of a fetch training session is extremely low
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 because her motivation is extremely high to play the game of frisbee or ball or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 After several throws, if she were to become distracted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=318.8s	318.8	 her energy is usually significantly depleted so that a light jog I could easily get to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=324.6s	324.6	 And she's not the kind of dog that's likely to bolt on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=327.4s	327.4	 And I think the reason for that is that we put in the work and built our communication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=331.2s	331.2	 so that she knows how to listen to me with simple requests like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=334.5s	334.5	 come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=335.2s	335.2	 So if she didn't come back to me, I first would shorten the distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=338.1s	338.1	 and try and get her to chase me, getting her attention back on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyNd_ZrQ-I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=340.9s	340.9	 If that wasn't successful, I'd go up to her and secure her on a leash.
