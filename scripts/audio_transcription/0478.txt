https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Since smaller dogs are easier to physically control, many people tend to overlook their leash walking manners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=5.1s	5.1	 Today though, we're going to focus on teaching a smaller dog how to walk nicely on leash.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 Now let's learn a little bit more about Bentley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=24.1s	24.1	 My name is Melissa and this is my dog Bentley and he's a Shih Tzu.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 Bentley is a year and a half. I've had Bentley for six months and he's a rescue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 Bentley really hasn't had any training. He's mostly a lap dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=37.6s	37.6	 The only thing he does know how to do is sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=40.4s	40.4	 Bentley's personality is happy-go-lucky. He just goes with the flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=45.1s	45.1	 When Bentley goes on a walk, he's preoccupied with everything else around him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=49.9s	49.9	 so he really doesn't pay attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 If he sees a bird, a squirrel, I am nowhere to be found.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 Zach, please help me get Bentley to pay attention to me when we walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 When you're first getting to know your dog, it's important to spend a lot of time with them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 but you don't have to spend a lot of time getting their dog food and supplies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=67.6s	67.6	 Choose your favorite brand of dog food, decide how often you want it delivered,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 and thank you to PepFlo for being this Dog Training Revolution's most important partner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 and for sponsoring this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=86.1s	86.1	 I make a ton of leash-walking videos, and I do them for good reason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 so that regardless of the type of dog you have, you'll have the most complete resource possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=93.9s	93.9	 to help you train your own dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 Leash-walking manners are important regardless of the size of your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=98.5s	98.5	 but make sure that you dedicate specific leash-training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 that don't center around your normal walks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 Since Bentley and I don't have a lot of communication with one another yet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=108.1s	108.1	 I want to work on getting his attention on me here in this indoor environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=111.9s	111.9	 Before I go outside, of course, there's going to be way more distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=115.2s	115.2	 I've got my turkey here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=116.7s	116.7	 I'm going to work on getting him to look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=119.1s	119.1	 That looks awesome. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=121.1s	121.1	 So I've got his full attention. Having a good currency is very important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=124.9s	124.9	 Now let me see if I can stand up and get his attention on me while I do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 Okay. Look at me. Oh, nice work. So, so far so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 He'll pay attention to me when I have a treat in my hand and hold it up to my eyes here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=137.4s	137.4	 but can I get his attention on me like this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=141.6s	141.6	 Yes, I'll take that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=142.9s	142.9	 Now let's see if I can get him moving around a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=145.9s	145.9	 So I'm going to start walking back and forth here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 Come on. Come here. Good job. I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 See, when you first start teaching your dog to walk on leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=154.8s	154.8	 you want to make it easy for them and you don't want to focus on taking a long walk with lots of distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=160.1s	160.1	 So it's important to ensure that you have their attention on you in a relatively distraction-free environment first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=167.1s	167.1	 So I can easily get his attention on me while walking around inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 That's exactly where we need to be to go on to the next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=174.7s	174.7	 So let's head on out to the park and see how things go there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=177.9s	177.9	 And now we're here in this crazy distracting environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 Let's give Bentley some time to get comfortable and sniff around before we ask him to pay attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=185.7s	185.7	 It's more challenging to get your dog to focus on you in new places since dogs are very smart, curious, observant animals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=193.1s	193.1	 There's nothing wrong with your dog or your training if they seem distracted at this point,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=196.8s	196.8	 in their training. Look at all these birds around here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=199.5s	199.5	 And look, he doesn't even want to eat that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=201.4s	201.4	 If you're doing leash training and your dog won't take a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=204.2s	204.2	 like I got a big old handful of turkey right here and you can see how Bentley doesn't even want it because the smells are overwhelming,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=211.9s	211.9	 the sights, the sounds, all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 So especially early on in your training, don't require your dog to listen to you under such heavy distractions like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=221.7s	221.7	 We need to take a step back so I can really remind Bentley as to how I'd like him to behave here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 We have a fair amount of distance right now between any major distractions, so it's a lot easier for me to keep his attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=232.5s	232.5	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=235.3s	235.3	 Look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=238.5s	238.5	 Pay attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 Oh, he gave me a glance, which was actually pretty good, but I don't exactly have as much focus as I'd like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 And this is what I suspected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=247.8s	247.8	 And since he's in this foreign environment, it's really important to use something that your dog really loves to keep their attention on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 I'm going to break out the turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=255.9s	255.9	 I'm going to hold it up just like we did before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=258.6s	258.6	 Great job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=259.5s	259.5	 And now look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=260.4s	260.4	 Hey, Bentley, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 And I mean, there you can see his attention is on me all day long right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=266.9s	266.9	 And that's fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 He's smelling the corner over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=269.8s	269.8	 He's a little distracted by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=271.3s	271.3	 I mean, dogs are going to do that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 This is a training opportunity here for me to see if I can get his attention on me while he's distracted and marking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=279.3s	279.3	 Hey, Bentley, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=281.4s	281.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=282.1s	282.1	 Fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 I'm virtually rewarding every single time he pays attention to me because this is his first leash training session in an environment like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=291.2s	291.2	 You want to avoid pulling your dog when they're distracted like this, especially with small dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=295.4s	295.4	 I mean, it's easy to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=296.9s	296.9	 It probably wouldn't hurt him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 I mean, he's on a harness, so a gentle tug isn't the worst thing in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=301.3s	301.3	 But you're not actually teaching when you do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=303.9s	303.9	 You want to teach your dog to think from the inside outward and reason through these situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 So you want to be able to get their attention on you voluntarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 Now, let's see if we can walk back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=314.4s	314.4	 That would be a major victory in an environment like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=318.4s	318.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=321.2s	321.2	 You want this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=322.9s	322.9	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=324.8s	324.8	 It's kind of a fine line at first between like luring your dog like this versus getting their attention on you voluntarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=332.0s	332.0	 So in the beginning, it's kind of a combination of the two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=335.2s	335.2	 But what we're working towards is being able to get our dogs to pay attention to us when we ask for their attention while on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=341.6s	341.6	 Hey, Bentley, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=343.7s	343.7	 Oh, I hear a Canada goose in the background somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 And that's got his attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=348.3s	348.3	 He voluntarily gave me his attention right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=350.7s	350.7	 So I'm going to be there to say, hey, I like that a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=353.5s	353.5	 I don't mind that he's checking out the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=355.6s	355.6	 What I don't want is him blunging and pulling towards a distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=359.9s	359.9	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=361.6s	361.6	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=362.1s	362.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=362.6s	362.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=363.8s	363.8	 He looked at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=364.4s	364.4	 He stopped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=365.1s	365.1	 Is it to say, I'm thinking about going to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=368.1s	368.1	 So I really want to seize that moment to encourage Bentley to come to me while he seems to be thinking about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=374.3s	374.3	 I've got tension on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 Now let me see if I can get his attention on me while this tension exists.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=379.2s	379.2	 Hey, Bentley, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=382.7s	382.7	 Hey, it doesn't always go this smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=384.3s	384.3	 But right now I'm thrilled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=385.6s	385.6	 So he's noticed the duck right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=387.2s	387.2	 Bentley, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=388.4s	388.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 I'll tell you what.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=390.4s	390.4	 Let's see if we can get a little bit closer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=392.6s	392.6	 Although that duck looks like he's on a mission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=395.7s	395.7	 So we're getting a little closer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=396.8s	396.8	 Bentley wants to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=398.5s	398.5	 Major tension on the leash right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=400.0s	400.0	 I don't like that from a training perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=402.2s	402.2	 So I'm going to attempt to get his attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=404.4s	404.4	 There's also a squirrel that's about to cross our path.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=406.4s	406.4	 So there's a squirrel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=407.4s	407.4	 There's a duck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=408.4s	408.4	 I don't even know if I want Bentley to see the squirrel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=411.3s	411.3	 Oh, all right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=412.3s	412.3	 Now he sees the squirrel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=413.3s	413.3	 Bentley, over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=414.3s	414.3	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=415.3s	415.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=416.3s	416.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=417.3s	417.3	 It was just a glance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=418.3s	418.3	 But right now this might be proving too much for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=421.0s	421.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=422.0s	422.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=423.9s	423.9	 That was wonderful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=425.1s	425.1	 That's a really good illustration of how he's in and out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=427.9s	427.9	 And it's a real fine line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=428.9s	428.9	 If I were to go much closer than that, I think it might be a bit overwhelming to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=432.4s	432.4	 Let's walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=433.4s	433.4	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=434.4s	434.4	 Bentley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=435.4s	435.4	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=436.4s	436.4	 I'll tell you what.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=437.4s	437.4	 Since he's doing so well, let me see if I can do the same exact drill without treating quite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=441.0s	441.0	 as much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=442.0s	442.0	 In other words, maybe I'll reward every other time or every third time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=445.1s	445.1	 And let's see how effective that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=446.7s	446.7	 Hey, Bentley.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=447.7s	447.7	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=448.7s	448.7	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=449.7s	449.7	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=450.7s	450.7	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=451.7s	451.7	 Still no reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=452.7s	452.7	 I've had three requests that he's honored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=453.9s	453.9	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=455.8s	455.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=456.8s	456.8	 Still no reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=457.8s	457.8	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=458.8s	458.8	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=459.8s	459.8	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=460.8s	460.8	 I'm going to reward there because he's starting to fade off a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=461.8s	461.8	 And I'm using really small bits of turkey here, about the size of a grain of rice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=465.1s	465.1	 I don't want to be too predictable in my rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=467.6s	467.6	 I'm mixing up the rate at which I reward him to keep him guessing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=471.1s	471.1	 And that's actually more effective sometimes than treating every single time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=475.1s	475.1	 Right now I'm not concerned with getting my walk done so I can get back home and get ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=478.3s	478.3	 for work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=479.3s	479.3	 I'm really focusing on Bentley right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=481.9s	481.9	 And that's key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=483.8s	483.8	 It's important to teach one dog at a time before you can expect them to walk nicely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=488.6s	488.6	 together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=489.6s	489.6	 So you have to get that real solid first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=491.0s	491.0	 Bentley, can I have your attention?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=492.8s	492.8	 That's wonderful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=493.8s	493.8	 You're doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=494.8s	494.8	 And in reality, teaching your dog to walk nicely on leash is really a months long process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=499.5s	499.5	 because you have to get them experience in tons of different places with tons of different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=503.9s	503.9	 distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=504.9s	504.9	 But with a dog like Bentley, he's going to be around for so long that it's worth putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuEPBcePu80&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=479&pp=iAQB&t=508.4s	508.4	 in the time right now.
