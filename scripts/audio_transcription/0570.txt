https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=266.8s	266.8	 her up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=268.8s	268.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=269.8s	269.8	 She looks pretty content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=270.8s	270.8	 She does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=271.8s	271.8	 I think it's a good idea to let her just kind of run around with it and make her forget
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=276.3s	276.3	 about the fact that it's on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=280.6s	280.6	 into the water.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=285.7s	285.7	 Yeah, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=286.7s	286.7	 Cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=287.7s	287.7	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=288.7s	288.7	 Josh is going to get in the pool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=289.7s	289.7	 We're going to see if we can encourage June to come in the pool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=291.4s	291.4	 I would love to join him, but my audio equipment might get destroyed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=294.6s	294.6	 You may need to take a few days to get them interested in the water and really get them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=298.9s	298.9	 comfortable with it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=303.6s	303.6	 I would imagine anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=306.5s	306.5	 Priority number one is to get or keep your dog in a good mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=309.9s	309.9	 If possible, try getting your dog to play with you around the pool so that they know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=313.4s	313.4	 that this is a fun place to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=315.8s	315.8	 It's important that you have something to really motivate your dog to get in the pool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=319.7s	319.7	 If your dog is receptive to a squeaky toy or any type of toy, I would encourage you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=324.1s	324.1	 to use that first before encouraging them with food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=326.9s	326.9	 But some dogs are really not as motivated by that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 So there's nothing wrong with using food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=331.2s	331.2	 Ah, nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=332.2s	332.2	 Yeah, good, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=333.2s	333.2	 Kind of slap her around with the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=335.4s	335.4	 Play with her a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=336.4s	336.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=340.8s	340.8	 Our goal is to make our dog want to swim, not just get them in the water for the sake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=344.3s	344.3	 of swimming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=345.3s	345.3	 If you notice that your dog starts to get increasingly nervous, either take a break
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=348.7s	348.7	 or find a way to put them at ease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=350.2s	350.2	 Now, I suspected that June might be a little bit more comfortable if we could make her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=354.0s	354.0	 feel a bit safer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=355.0s	355.0	 And you can see there's a little anxiety on her part, but she is considering it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=358.5s	358.5	 You can tell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=359.5s	359.5	 Like her tail's wagging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=360.5s	360.5	 Now, what do you think she's saying right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=366.6s	366.6	 This first step is only a few inches, so if she's comfortable with it, I'd like to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=370.4s	370.4	 if we can put her on this first step right here and then maybe it might make it easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=374.0s	374.0	 So it's not so daunting to just jump straight down into something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=376.7s	376.7	 We want to immediately get that positive association if possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=380.8s	380.8	 My preference may have been to take June out of the pool here after she fell, but I could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=384.5s	384.5	 tell that Josh saw that she was receptive to listening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=387.7s	387.7	 So it made sense to let this play out a little bit longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=390.2s	390.2	 Sometimes you just have to let a person connect with their dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=392.9s	392.9	 Oh, what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=393.9s	393.9	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=394.9s	394.9	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=395.9s	395.9	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=396.9s	396.9	 And then give her some support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=397.9s	397.9	 Go ahead and put her out to let her know that she can get out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=402.3s	402.3	 The point of that is just so she doesn't freak out immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=405.2s	405.2	 A lot of dogs will be like, oh my gosh, how do I get out of here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=407.2s	407.2	 And look, she looks just fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=408.2s	408.2	 She was a little bit nervous before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=409.3s	409.3	 We tried to get her to come in with a toy, but now we're going to use chicken and see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=412.7s	412.7	 if that motivates her to want to come in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=414.7s	414.7	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=415.7s	415.7	 Yeah, but keep that, keep it coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=418.3s	418.3	 You know what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=419.3s	419.3	 I mean, this is a huge victory right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=420.7s	420.7	 She's voluntarily staying in the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=423.1s	423.1	 Now we are creating that good association by giving her chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=426.5s	426.5	 I have a feeling that she's going to not care about the chicken at all once she gets used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=430.8s	430.8	 to the water.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=434.7s	434.7	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=436.7s	436.7	 And give her some support.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=440.6s	440.6	 Hold her so she knows you've got her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=442.7s	442.7	 That was a wonderful moment right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=444.7s	444.7	 Make her feel safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=445.7s	445.7	 That's what we're trying to do with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=447.2s	447.2	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=448.2s	448.2	 That's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=449.2s	449.2	 Hold her while she's underwater a bit, if you'd like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=451.3s	451.3	 That way she becomes a bit more desensitized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=453.7s	453.7	 If you feel the moment is right, let go of her a little bit and then immediately pick

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY1Ef6C7WQ4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=571&pp=iAQB&t=471.6s	471.6	 But I think we have some momentum here, so let's keep going.
