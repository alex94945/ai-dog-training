https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=101.2s	101.2	 Let's take our first question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=102.9s	102.9	 Janet posted this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=104.2s	104.2	 I can't get my dog Murphy to come when I call him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=106.9s	106.9	 He's nine months old and he takes off when you try to get him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=110.9s	110.9	 He runs around like it's a game and I'm afraid he'll get hit by a car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Janet, you're very right to be concerned about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 This is a potentially dangerous thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 Now it sounds to me that you need to work more on stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=124.9s	124.9	 Come when called is very important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=125.9s	125.9	 I'll have a video in the description that will help you teach your dog stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=130.8s	130.8	 But remember that too much freedom too early on in life is the biggest mistake that people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=136.3s	136.3	 make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 who is in an uncontrolled setting and you want to know how to get him back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=142.5s	142.5	 I don't have any magic answers on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=144.3s	144.3	 You have to set him up for these situations before they occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 This means practicing a good 20 minutes to an hour a day, working on all of your obedience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 including come when called in a controlled setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=154.5s	154.5	 Now how do we control the setting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=155.9s	155.9	 Well, we can practice in a fenced area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 We can practice with a long lead or leash on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=161.7s	161.7	 We can practice indoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 But the main thing is you want to work on this for many, many months before you let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=167.9s	167.9	 your dog off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=169.3s	169.3	 This next question comes from Jamie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 When teaching my foster dog to fetch, he'll run and snip a toy without picking it up or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=175.3s	175.3	 he doesn't even chase it at all and he jumps on me instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=178.6s	178.6	 Okay, totally get what you're saying here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 This is so common for young dogs in particular.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=184.1s	184.1	 I think a lot of us have this idea that in a couple of training sessions, we ought to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=187.7s	187.7	 be able to teach the most perfect game of fetch and that our dog should chase it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=193.1s	193.1	 bring it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=194.8s	194.8	 A lot of people don't realize this, but fetch is not a natural game to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 They have to learn how to play it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=200.4s	200.4	 Now some dogs will take to it a little more quickly than others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=203.1s	203.1	 But here's the good news.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=204.1s	204.1	 There's a couple of things you said here that I want to point out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 You said your dog jumps on you like crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 That's because your dog loves you and wants to interact with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=212.3s	212.3	 I think a lot of us think that the game of fetch is about the ball or the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 It's not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=219.2s	219.2	 The game is about interacting with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 So if we can bring life to that ball into that toy as we throw it, that's what we want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=225.3s	225.3	 to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=226.3s	226.3	 We don't just want to say, hey, look here, go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 You know, we want to be like, hey, hey, here it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 Here's the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 And if they don't run, run with them, show them how to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Get them to chase you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 Pick it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 Play keep away with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=238.1s	238.1	 That's the best thing in the world you can do to really ignite fetch and really get you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=242.5s	242.5	 on the right track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=243.5s	243.5	 You also said that your dog goes up to the toy and sniffs it and then just, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=247.6s	247.6	 loses interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 Totally understandable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=250.8s	250.8	 These dogs have very little interest in chasing something that's not moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=255.7s	255.7	 So in this case, you've thrown the toy, it moves, but then it's stopped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=259.2s	259.2	 The moment it stops is the moment your dog loses interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=262.9s	262.9	 It is far better to practice on getting fetch really solid three or four feet away, 30 times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 than it is to launch it because all those distractions between returning that ball back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=274.2s	274.2	 to you and you can just totally derail a game of fetch in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=279.5s	279.5	 So be understanding of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=280.9s	280.9	 Set your dog up for success and keep it easy for them in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=284.6s	284.6	 Now I have a whole playlist dedicated to teaching your dog fetch where I illustrate all of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=289.8s	289.8	 things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=290.8s	290.8	 That'll be in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=291.8s	291.8	 Do you guys like the Q&A format?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=293.9s	293.9	 Tell me in the comments below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 So this is another come when called question from Krista, but I want to make a separate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=299.5s	299.5	 point about this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=301.1s	301.1	 In a nutshell, because it's a bit long, Krista says, we adopted our five month old puppy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=333.5s	333.5	 your kids accidentally letting your dog out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 That cannot happen because we have to take responsibility and make sure that we control

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=348.3s	348.3	 opening the door, you need to be preemptive and make sure you have a dog in the part of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=393.1s	393.1	 So before the age of five months, largely speaking, plenty of exceptions to this, dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=398.9s	398.9	 tend to stay near us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=400.1s	400.1	 They tend to not roam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=403.8s	403.8	 They really like being near us and they'll follow us everywhere and they'll chase us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=407.6s	407.6	 So if we're a bit naive, we tend to think, oh, my dog likes staying near me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=412.6s	412.6	 I guess I just really lucked out and got a good dog that doesn't run off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=416.1s	416.1	 They haven't really hit their peak of curiosity yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=419.5s	419.5	 You see, once they hit around five months of age, they start to wander.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=423.5s	423.5	 Just enough for you to think it's an isolated incident here and there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=428.0s	428.0	 And before you know it, they're gone and they keep running everywhere and you can never

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=434.9s	434.9	 Start controlling your dog's environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=436.5s	436.5	 Five month old dog has no excuse to be in an uncontrolled environment for any reason

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=453.9s	453.9	 Now, of course, you'll need to be, you'll need to use common sense about the period
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=458.0s	458.0	 of time that you keep your dog in that setting, but also getting your dog tired within reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=462.9s	462.9	 We have to be a bit cautious with a five month old because they're still growing and developing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=477.8s	477.8	 My dog is so determined to fetch that she sometimes trips over her feet and twists one

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=515.7s	515.7	 We are in dog training of so many people relying on the pinch collars, prong collars and shot

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=530.8s	530.8	 Do you know what I mean?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=535.7s	535.7	 Your question has more to do with if dog sports that have structure like this are acceptable

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=569.0s	569.0	 How can we help our 12 week old sleep longer at night?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=573.3s	573.3	 She's sleeping in the crate in our room, going to bed around 10 PM, wanting to go outside

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=580.7s	580.7	 And then she's ready to play at 4 AM.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=583.1s	583.1	 Any guidance you can offer is much appreciated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=585.9s	585.9	 So bottom line, you have a 12 week old who doesn't sleep through the night yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=589.1s	589.1	 This varies from puppy to puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=590.6s	590.6	 Some puppies will just be fine all the way through the night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=593.2s	593.2	 Some are somewhere in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=594.7s	594.7	 Your dog sounds like a relatively high maintenance case of wanting to get up often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=599.7s	599.7	 So you do need to work on getting that schedule right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=604.3s	604.3	 But respectfully, none of us are entitled to a good night's sleep when we have, when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=612.4s	612.4	 12 week old puppies just like infants tend to wake up during the night, they cry, they

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=583&pp=iAQB&t=624.6s	624.6	 This is all part of getting to know your individual dog.
