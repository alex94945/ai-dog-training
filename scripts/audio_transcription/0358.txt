https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=1.8s	1.8	 So let's cover why you should not have your dog's food automatically shipped to you from PepFlo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 Having to drop everything and go do an unexpected chore? That's fun!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=10.3s	10.3	 My cruise leaves in one hour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=12.4s	12.4	 I better feed Indy first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=14.1s	14.1	 Oh wait, I'm out of dog food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=16.7s	16.7	 I didn't want to take that cruise anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=18.6s	18.6	 You love sitting in traffic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=20.8s	20.8	 Traffic is the best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=22.7s	22.7	 Carrying heavy bags of dog food, that gives you a great workout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 Of course you don't want to try it out because saving $10 on your first three automatic shipments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 after entering code ZACH30 is not as good as paying full price after driving across town.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=35.1s	35.1	 Saving money?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 He is super cute, isn't he?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=50.5s	50.5	 Make sure you're subscribed to my channel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=56.2s	56.2	 It's a great way to keep up with the dog training revolution between videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=59.4s	59.4	 I do live Q&A's and just generally interact with you and help you with your dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=63.2s	63.2	 I'll have a link in the description.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Joining me today is Charlie's mom Brandy and today I'm going to show you a shortcut to get your training started off right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=72.4s	72.4	 How to teach your puppy to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=73.9s	73.9	 We'll go over some puppy biting tips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 How to introduce your puppy to new dogs and more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=78.1s	78.1	 So we've got a lot to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 We have so many great videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=81.7s	81.7	 We've got a lot to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=83.4s	83.4	 We have so many new subscribers lately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=85.4s	85.4	 I want to make sure that all of you know how to do clicker training because clicker training is a really great way for you as the person to start refining your training ability and get really good at timing, which is a critical factor when you're training any dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 And it really just helps to sharpen up your overall communication with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=101.8s	101.8	 This is a clicker right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=103.1s	103.1	 You can get these at a lot of different places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=104.9s	104.9	 If you want a clicker like this, join my Patreon community to learn how to get one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=108.2s	108.2	 It's a good idea to have lots of clickers too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=110.1s	110.1	 So you have them easily available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=111.6s	111.6	 They're pretty inexpensive as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=113.1s	113.1	 All it does, it makes a clicking sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=115.6s	115.6	 We're going to pair that clicking sound with an actual treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=118.6s	118.6	 It goes like this click and I'm going to give them a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 Just a tiny piece of real meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=122.6s	122.6	 That's what I'm using today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=123.7s	123.7	 This is called conditioning your dog to the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=126.8s	126.8	 I'm not asking Charlie to do anything at this particular moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 I'm just clicking, waiting a second and giving them a very tiny piece of turkey about the size of a grain of rice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=136.1s	136.1	 And in a moment, assuming he's been taught to sit for a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 my guess is we're going to see him pop into a sit the moment he hears that click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=143.1s	143.1	 You want to do this between 10 and 50 times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=146.1s	146.1	 Just click and treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=148.2s	148.2	 Don't overcomplicate this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=149.4s	149.4	 Your goal is just to get your dog to associate that clicking sound with getting an amazing treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=156.1s	156.1	 That's the automatic sit I was looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 To me, that's usually evidence that a dog is making the connection that they're going to get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 And there it is again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 To be clear, the clicker is not a signaling device to tell your dog to do something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 It actually happens as a desired behavior takes place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 And then the moment he does something we like, we're going to click and treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=174.2s	174.2	 It's worth noting that some dogs might get nervous of that loud sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=177.4s	177.4	 So you'll want to kind of introduce it from a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 But Charlie's doing really well right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=181.7s	181.7	 So now that he's clearly made the connection, how do you actually start to use the clicker in real training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=186.7s	186.7	 You basically use the clicker anytime your dog does what you like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 In that case, he came up from a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 Watch this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=193.3s	193.3	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 I also have a habit of pairing the word yes with it for times when I don't have my clicker and for later on in the training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=200.5s	200.5	 As your dog voluntarily offers things or as you encourage your dog to do things, you just simply click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=205.8s	205.8	 The click means good dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=207.2s	207.2	 I like what you just did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=208.5s	208.5	 I'm going to give you a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=210.1s	210.1	 Pay attention to the timing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=211.5s	211.5	 Let's see if we can get Charlie to go into a lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 The moment he went all the way down, I clicked and made sure I gave him a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=221.4s	221.4	 And I kind of like that he's offering his foot right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=224.2s	224.2	 See how he lifted his foot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=225.3s	225.3	 I'm going to go ahead and reward that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=226.3s	226.3	 That's a great way to capture behavior as they're offering it even without you asking for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 That's a nice little trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=232.4s	232.4	 Shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 There I just said shake for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=235.3s	235.3	 I'm not too caught up with the actual language at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=238.2s	238.2	 I'm really just trying to get him to go through the actions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 But as it becomes more reliable, shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=243.3s	243.3	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=243.9s	243.9	 The idea here is that your dog starts to brainstorm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=246.9s	246.9	 What can I do to make that clicker go off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 Let me cover a couple of the really common objections to clicker training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=252.3s	252.3	 Number one is, why can't I just say yes or good boy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 And actually you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=255.9s	255.9	 It's just fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=256.7s	256.7	 But if you're a beginner, you'll probably find that having a button in your hand to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=261.4s	261.4	 I like that behavior is going to be a lot more beneficial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 In other words, you're going to be a lot quicker when you have a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 The second question is, can I make a sound with my mouth?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=269.3s	269.3	 Like you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=270.4s	270.4	 However, this is an artificial sound and it's consistent every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=274.2s	274.2	 It just makes things a little bit easier in general.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=276.2s	276.2	 Is it required?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=277.1s	277.1	 No, but it'll probably help you out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=278.5s	278.5	 Brandy's been doing some training with Charlie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 Let's see what Charlie's learned so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=281.7s	281.7	 Charlie, sit, sit, sit, shake, shake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 Nah, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=287.9s	287.9	 He's shaking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=288.6s	288.6	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=289.3s	289.3	 Touchdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 Come on, touchdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=294.6s	294.6	 You know why I clicked there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=295.7s	295.7	 You could see in his eyes he was thinking about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 Mm-hmm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=298.1s	298.1	 Come on, touchdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=299.9s	299.9	 Yeah, nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=301.5s	301.5	 Awesome, we got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=302.6s	302.6	 That's a clever trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=303.5s	303.5	 I will give that one a 10 out of 10 on originality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 Oh, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=306.7s	306.7	 One note I will give you, and everyone has this habit of repeating things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=311.2s	311.2	 Sit, sit, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=312.5s	312.5	 Try to break that habit so it doesn't become a three syllable word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=315.3s	315.3	 Typically what I'll do is something like sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=320.1s	320.1	 Wait it out a little bit to see if they do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=321.4s	321.4	 If they don't do it, then I'll give a gentle, non-emotional no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=325.3s	325.3	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=326.4s	326.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=328.2s	328.2	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 Perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=329.4s	329.4	 It's a real hard habit to get into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 It is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=331.4s	331.4	 But it will really clean up a lot of the communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=333.8s	333.8	 That's a good tip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=334.7s	334.7	 It's important not to jumble too much of your early training with a bunch of words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=338.9s	338.9	 but it's a fine line too because dogs can actually understand sentences and phrases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 Most people think dogs only understand tones or one word at a time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=346.7s	346.7	 but there's actually quite a bit of science on this that shows that dogs are capable of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=350.1s	350.1	 putting sentences together, provided you take the time to teach them early training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=354.4s	354.4	 You really want to keep it pretty basic and pretty simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=357.1s	357.1	 Touchdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=358.7s	358.7	 Touchdown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=359.5s	359.5	 I love it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=360.2s	360.2	 Brandy, what general questions do you have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=362.2s	362.2	 I mean, usually people with a dog this young have a lot of questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 He just started, like, if you walk, he wants to bite the back of your pants or something to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=370.8s	370.8	 So I don't know if you have any tips for trying to break him of that habit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=373.7s	373.7	 Yeah, puppy biting and biting at ankles and clothes, really common.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=377.8s	377.8	 With dogs this young, this is how they interact with the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=380.5s	380.5	 If you've got clothes moving, they're going to try to bite them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=383.3s	383.3	 So our goal isn't to eliminate it immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=385.6s	385.6	 It's to reduce it slowly over the next few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=388.3s	388.3	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=388.7s	388.7	 So the way to do that is to consistently redirect, Charlie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=391.5s	391.5	 So if you see it in his eyes that he's about to bite,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=393.8s	393.8	 you should have treats scattered throughout the house and Tupperware containers or something like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=397.2s	397.2	 that where you can quickly get to him, lure him with a treat, put him into a sit reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=401.4s	401.4	 Show him what you prefer he do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=402.6s	402.6	 When he's biting, what would you prefer he do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 You'd prefer that he sit and stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=406.1s	406.1	 And so you gradually work up to a five, 10 second stay and so forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=409.4s	409.4	 He doesn't stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=410.5s	410.5	 We have been practicing stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=411.8s	411.8	 He does not stay at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=413.1s	413.1	 I say we train it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=414.2s	414.2	 With stay, we break it down into three major categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=416.6s	416.6	 We have stay for a period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=418.6s	418.6	 We have stay while we walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=420.4s	420.4	 And then finally, stay with distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=422.0s	422.0	 Why don't we work on something like stay for a period of time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=425.3s	425.3	 And then there are so many distractions out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=427.1s	427.1	 Maybe we can get him to stay with a minor distraction at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=429.9s	429.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=431.0s	431.0	 I'm telling him stay because he's staying right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=433.4s	433.4	 In other words, I'm not saying stay while he's running around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=435.6s	435.6	 I'm capturing him while he's in a stay position right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=439.4s	439.4	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=441.0s	441.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=441.6s	441.6	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=442.1s	442.1	 It's a one second stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=443.1s	443.1	 And you're using a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=444.4s	444.4	 That's right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 We should accompany a lot of our verbal requests with hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=448.8s	448.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=451.3s	451.3	 A little bit longer that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=452.3s	452.3	 You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=452.8s	452.8	 He's doing so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=453.5s	453.5	 He doesn't do it like this at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=456.1s	456.1	 That's why you practice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=457.2s	457.2	 We're using clicker training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=458.2s	458.2	 We're using a high value currency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=459.6s	459.6	 These are probably things that you're not doing at home, I'm guessing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=461.8s	461.8	 Correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=462.2s	462.2	 So that might make the difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=463.5s	463.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=463.8s	463.8	 Oh, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=464.5s	464.5	 He's doing really well with the dog walking by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=467.3s	467.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=468.7s	468.7	 Whoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=469.6s	469.6	 Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=470.3s	470.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=471.1s	471.1	 This is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=471.9s	471.9	 That was perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=472.6s	472.6	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=473.1s	473.1	 And so right now, notice the timing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=474.8s	474.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=475.8s	475.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=476.2s	476.2	 I'm rapid firing the rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=477.9s	477.9	 He's looking at the dog and he's staying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=479.8s	479.8	 That's a big deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=480.7s	480.7	 These are the spontaneous moments you have to be prepared for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=483.3s	483.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=483.7s	483.7	 And so right there, that required me to burst into training mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=486.3s	486.3	 That's called a secondary training session when you just have to burst into training mode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=490.1s	490.1	 when it's unplanned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=491.0s	491.0	 That was a good example of one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=492.4s	492.4	 When should I try to start introducing him to other dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=496.1s	496.1	 Now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=496.8s	496.8	 Now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=497.3s	497.3	 Now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=497.5s	497.5	 And generally, the ideal way that I recommend doing that is introducing him to dogs that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=502.6s	502.6	 are extremely likely to react well to him because puppies don't have manners yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=507.0s	507.0	 They may go up and bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=508.8s	508.8	 And if you introduce him to the wrong dog, it could not go well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=512.6s	512.6	 So one way to protect against that, look at things like doggy daycares.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=515.8s	515.8	 The staff know the dogs there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=517.1s	517.1	 They know which dogs are likely to react well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=519.0s	519.0	 That's a great way to introduce it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=521.1s	521.1	 Friends dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=521.9s	521.9	 People usually know how their dog is going to do with a rambunctious puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=525.5s	525.5	 Other issue that we're having is he has a booster seat in the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=528.9s	528.9	 He hates it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=530.2s	530.2	 He would just throw a fit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=531.8s	531.8	 He would get so mad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=533.5s	533.5	 Good question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=534.3s	534.3	 So usually with things like securing him to the booster seat or just getting him comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=538.2s	538.2	 with being in a car, you want to go real slow and you don't want to wait until it's time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=541.7s	541.7	 to take a ride.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=542.5s	542.5	 It's important to set up training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=544.2s	544.2	 So for example, putting him in the booster seat when you have nothing else to do, click,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=548.0s	548.0	 treat, or good dog, give him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=549.8s	549.8	 That's a great idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=550.2s	550.2	 I never even thought about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=551.6s	551.6	 Breaking things down into smaller steps isn't really intuitive to us when we're training dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=555.8s	555.8	 But if you can get that, it's like if you're having trouble with anything,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=558.6s	558.6	 if you just ask yourself, how can I make this as low stress and easy as possible for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=562.6s	562.6	 just to get traction?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=563.8s	563.8	 And then you gradually make it more and more challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=566.6s	566.6	 That's a good idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=567.4s	567.4	 I think I need to work with him and give him some rewards for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=570.0s	570.0	 What other questions do you have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=571.2s	571.2	 When do you start to withhold some of the treats and know that the behavior is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=575.1s	575.1	 to stick without the treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=576.3s	576.3	 Well, I like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=577.0s	577.0	 You're on top of things here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=578.0s	578.0	 Yeah, you might have noticed I'm rewarding just about every single time that he's doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=581.9s	581.9	 something that I like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=582.9s	582.9	 In the beginning, as behaviors are kind of shaky and unreliable, it's really important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=587.2s	587.2	 to reward close to 100% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=590.0s	590.0	 But as behaviors become more reliable, you reward a little bit less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=593.6s	593.6	 However, it's not quite that simple because you also want to up your rate of reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=597.8s	597.8	 periodically just to let him know, look, sometimes you get the jackpot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=600.8s	600.8	 Think about slot machines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=601.8s	601.8	 One of the reasons slot machines are so addictive is because you never know when you're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=605.7s	605.7	 to win.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=606.1s	606.1	 And so during early training, really the first year of training, you want to let them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=609.6s	609.6	 get those jackpots from time to time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=611.4s	611.4	 Would you say for the next week, if I practice with this, I reward 100% of the time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=615.0s	615.0	 If this was my dog and I was working with him from day to day, I would quickly probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=619.1s	619.1	 bring it down to 75%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=620.8s	620.8	 On Sit, for example, he's so reliable, but I want to keep him reliable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgMBz1Zorw&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=359&pp=iAQB&t=624.4s	624.4	 So I don't want to get too lean on the rewards.
