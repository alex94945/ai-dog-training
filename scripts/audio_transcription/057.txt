https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Is it normal for my 9-week-old puppy to pee every 10 minutes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=3.4s	3.4	 Nine-week-old puppies are leaky water balloons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=5.7s	5.7	 He lasts for up to three hours while he's asleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=7.7s	7.7	 What can I do to extend his time between potty breaks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=10.2s	10.2	 Obviously, if you think there's a medical thing there that can be common with puppies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=13.1s	13.1	 you can always go to your vet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=14.3s	14.3	 If you've literally measured the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 and I recommend those of you who want to be extra,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 go above and beyond, have that timer going between potty breaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 Generally, once an hour though with a brand new 9-week-old,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=24.9s	24.9	 especially if they're not familiar with your home or haven't been crate trained yet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 you have to take them out every 10 minutes in this case,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 or less, every nine minutes, since it's every 10 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 And see, that's counterintuitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 Some people are like, oh, that's too much work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 But what you're communicating there is like, this is where we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 Even if you have to do this for a week straight, every nine minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 except for when they're sleeping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 I'm being extreme. I don't think you really have to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 But that'll be enough to give you traction on teaching the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 where you want them to do their business.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASD89lHjFRQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 So take them out often is the simplest answer I can give you.
