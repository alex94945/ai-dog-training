https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=3.4s	3.4	 In fact, exercise can eliminate 90% of unwanted behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=8.2s	8.2	 But if you find that exercise doesn't seem to reduce your dog's hyperactivity or anxiety,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=30.6s	30.6	 You want your dog to be mentally and physically prepared for adequate exercise, so it's really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 important to feed them a high quality food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=37.1s	37.1	 And I'm sure you could do with fewer errands in your life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 So conquer both of these tasks by getting your food from Pet Flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 Choose your dog's favorite food, decide how often you want to deliver to your front door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=45.6s	45.6	 and enter code ZAC30 when you check out and you'll get $10 off your first three orders.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=51.6s	51.6	 First, how you exercise your dog is critical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=54.8s	54.8	 Now it's true that when many of us think about exercising our dog, we think about walking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=58.7s	58.7	 And for many dogs, that's good enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 But for those extremely high energy dogs, you know, the ones that are likely to be experiencing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=64.4s	64.4	 a lot of behavior problems, walks likely won't cut it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=67.3s	67.3	 For those high energy dogs, mentally challenging them during physical exercise is by far the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 path of least resistance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=74.3s	74.3	 You could do things like dog sports or marathon training sessions with your dog, which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 great if they're loving it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 You weren't ready for that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=80.9s	80.9	 You might notice I've got this long lead on him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 That's to keep him from getting too far away from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 Even though I'm in a fenced area, I still want to be able to encourage him to come straight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 back to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=89.5s	89.5	 This is called multiples where you work with multiple frisbees at one time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 Now he's never done this before, so we're just going to see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=96.1s	96.1	 And the idea is to just be able to go one, two, three, four, five, six.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 He's not there yet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=104.8s	104.8	 Catch it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=116.2s	116.2	 Catch it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 Catch it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=127.5s	127.5	 game of fetch is the most practical way to achieve this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=130.6s	130.6	 See that engages both the mind and the body of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 As you can see, Jacob is sitting and staying right now in the hope that he's going to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 a frisbee.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 So look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=149.3s	149.3	 He let go when I said let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=150.8s	150.8	 Love it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 and physically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 I mean, dogs were created to work with people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 So it would make sense that they find physical and mental satisfaction when working with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=164.4s	164.4	 us, which is why playing with other dogs or spending time in a large yard alone doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=170.9s	170.9	 that activity with people does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=172.7s	172.7	 Next, when should you exercise your dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=175.2s	175.2	 Well, a good four to five times a week is pretty ideal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=178.6s	178.6	 But if you wait until after work to exercise your dog for the first time that day, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=182.2s	182.2	 you're likely waiting until too late in the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=184.9s	184.9	 Exercise first thing in the morning is the most beneficial because you're getting all

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 dig holes in the backyard or bark endlessly.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=201.3s	201.3	 In fact, many dogs will thrive if you break up their exercise sessions throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=205.3s	205.3	 Next, wrongly assuming that your dog is done exercising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 You might notice, for example, that when you're doing an activity like fetch with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 that they seemingly get tired after just a few minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=215.6s	215.6	 Chances are though, they're just getting warmed up and they just need to take a break for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=219.5s	219.5	 a few minutes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=243.8s	243.8	 It's normal for your breaks to become more frequent towards the end of that hour.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZENjM1dDo4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=470&pp=iAQB&t=258.6s	258.6	 I'm going to have a video in the description that will show you how to teach your dog a
