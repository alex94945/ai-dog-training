https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=3.1s	3.1	 This is a free walk, so I want both dogs to feel fairly liberated to explore and smell and do their own thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 Even if they are a little bit chaotic on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=13.5s	13.5	 Hey Veronica!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 Here, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=18.5s	18.5	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 On a free walk like this though, I'm still going to make sure that I reinforce them coming to me when I call them or any other number of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 Hey, I like that you just sat right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 I'm trying to assess, is she anxious? Does she want to play?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 I think it might be a combination of everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 Either way, I love that she's looking to me for direction right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 Even though I really try to avoid asking for too much on walks like these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 I still definitely want to be here to let Veronica know that I love it every time she voluntarily gives me her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 Seriously, if you want your dog to pay attention to you, try this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RasCCkvmyeA&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 I think you might be shocked at how much it helps to get your dog in the habit of listening to you overall.
