https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This is such an unusual video for us to make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=2.7s	2.7	 I asked you guys to come up with some original questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 You did not disappoint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 Here you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=8.4s	8.4	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=8.9s	8.9	 That was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=9.5s	9.5	 We have the coolest sponsors on all of YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=13.5s	13.5	 So we have BarkBox and Super Chewer Box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=15.9s	15.9	 Super Chewer Box is for dogs who can really challenge a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 You get really durable toys like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=22.4s	22.4	 If you've got a Pipple or a Rottweiler or someone who likes to really chomp on toys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 they'll just be chewing on this like chewing gum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 How about a Pipple Mix?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 And these come for smaller dogs too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=30.9s	30.9	 They do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 That smells so delightful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 You get really top quality treats, which I like because I train a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 So many chews!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=38.4s	38.4	 Veronica is more of a Super Chewer Dog and Inersha is more of a BarkBox dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=41.5s	41.5	 Like an apple pie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=42.5s	42.5	 It's pumpkin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 Like a fast food Thanksgiving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=45.4s	45.4	 You hear that texture?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 Squeak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 All sorts of textures to interact with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=49.8s	49.8	 See the different frequencies of the squeaks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 This is why I love BarkBox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=53.3s	53.3	 Turkey nuggets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=54.5s	54.5	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 Those actual nuggets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 The dipping sauce opens for the turkey nuggets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 If you know someone who's obsessed with their dog and you get them a Bark subscription,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 I don't think they're going to know what to do with themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 You can get a free box when you sign up for a subscription.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Go to BarkBox.com or SuperChewer.com slash dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=70.4s	70.4	 I'll have links below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=71.6s	71.6	 Cindy Sykes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 My husky has such a strong prey drive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=74.8s	74.8	 She's sometimes aggressive towards other small dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 I've been working with her and it's better, but it's not perfect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 Never expect perfection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=81.8s	81.8	 I mean, all dogs have teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 If they have a history where they've gotten into altercations with dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=87.3s	87.3	 you need to file that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=88.1s	88.1	 So I'll take you at your word that your dog has high prey drive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=92.1s	92.1	 I don't know if we're working with the same definitions here or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 They did use the word aggressive, which is another word that can get used and misused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 Dogs are not aggressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 There's no such thing as an aggressive dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 Dogs behave aggressively in some contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 That is not a small difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=109.7s	109.7	 Okay, I'm not going to go on too much of a rant with this right now,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 but understanding how to work with a dog to cope in that particular context or how to manage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=117.5s	117.5	 so that context doesn't arise is very important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 Any help and suggestions would be great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 This is especially a problem at dog parks, which she really needs for exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=127.5s	127.5	 Don't go to a dog park if your dog has issues with other dogs of any size.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 It's great that you understand that your dog needs exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=134.8s	134.8	 and that you're going out of your way to help them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 Playing with dogs, number one, only goes so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 Dogs were bred to work with people, so it's my hypothesis that when they are regularly engaging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 with a person, that that's one of the more organic, natural ways to really satisfy a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=150.6s	150.6	 mentally performing a task with a person like fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 Dog parks can be really good for dogs that like being in dog parks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 But that is probably half of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 Anecdotally, I don't have any science on this, but I know that it's not a small percentage of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 dogs that would prefer not to be in the dog park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 They're not the happiest there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 Or that might be okay in a dog park, but might not rebound very well from a bad experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=177.8s	177.8	 And it's hard to be sure that your dog won't have a bad experience at a dog park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=182.9s	182.9	 You can't control for other dogs like this one, who might probably shouldn't be there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 And so that can be a bad experience for other dogs, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=191.1s	191.1	 Sure. And it's not most people's fault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 Most people don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 And it's so normal for people to think I have a dog, they need to play with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 I mean, ignorance is no excuse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=201.7s	201.7	 I appreciate your diplomacy, but the reason dog parks don't work are because people bring dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=207.5s	207.5	 into a dog park that should not be in that dog park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=210.7s	210.7	 What I look for in a dog park is two to three dogs in there, all with a healthy play style.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=215.8s	215.8	 I'm not anti dog park completely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 If your dog doesn't get along with a certain kind of dog, like small dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=221.5s	221.5	 maybe that's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=222.3s	222.3	 And maybe they just don't need to play with small dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=224.4s	224.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=224.9s	224.9	 It's really important to make sure that while providing that regular exercise that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 counter conditioning them and managing them, which we go into in other content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 But anytime your dog has a bite history or a history of not getting along with other dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 you need to really, really prioritize the conditions that your dog finds themselves in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=245.4s	245.4	 Reverend Squirrel has the next question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 Their dog is really good at home, but then when they're in public and they see other dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=250.6s	250.6	 their dog is super reactive and they feel like they've tried everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=253.8s	253.8	 I mean, that makes perfect sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 That's how it goes with most reactive dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=257.5s	257.5	 If your dog is reacting to other dogs, it takes time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=260.2s	260.2	 I mean, that's one of the main purposes of my YouTube channel because arguably the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=264.6s	264.6	 challenging thing that people struggle with with adult dogs is lunging and barking on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=270.2s	270.2	 When their dog sees another dog, I've had the honor of working with many dogs who have that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 characteristic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=276.5s	276.5	 You've got to be understanding with dogs like this and you need to manage your expectations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=281.1s	281.1	 Too many of us have the expectation that this should be resolved quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=284.8s	284.8	 And when you're talking about complex issues like your dog being a dog and saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 Hey, there's a dog over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=290.6s	290.6	 I'm either scared of that dog, so I'm going to bark and lunge or I'm very excited by that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=351.8s	351.8	 work on building, hey, come here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=358.2s	358.2	 By all means, if your dog has a rock in their mouth, you better go in there and take it out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=419.0s	419.0	 Talk about that in the comments because I'm curious to see what the ratio of people is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=427.6s	427.6	 I guess let's take inertia, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=430.2s	430.2	 Do I ever regret getting inertia?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=432.9s	432.9	 I love inertia more than anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=434.9s	434.9	 My wife, I love her as much as my wife.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=437.1s	437.1	 He doesn't regret getting me either because every dog is different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=441.4s	441.4	 I think you almost never get the dog you think you're going to get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=445.4s	445.4	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=445.8s	445.8	 You only have the experience that you have throughout your life, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=449.6s	449.6	 And so I've worked with a good number of dogs, but I also am the first one to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=453.0s	453.0	 hey, they're all different.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=459.3s	459.3	 how different she was, was a process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=461.6s	461.6	 It was a double-edged sword because she was one of like, as far as personal dogs that I've had,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=466.4s	466.4	 she is probably, you know, one of the more challenging dogs I had earlier on in life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=471.4s	471.4	 You can't just expect them to turn off all of their instincts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=474.9s	474.9	 That's why I'm so big on having an outlet for dogs so that they can get a lot of that satisfied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=480.9s	480.9	 Nonetheless, inertia and I figuring out each other took a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=484.9s	484.9	 And I'm so glad we shot an entire series on working through that because I had plenty of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=495.3s	495.3	 valuable content for other people too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=534.3s	534.3	 We all have a limited amount of patience and it's okay to run out of it but you just have to know

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=692.4s	692.4	 She was a little bit harder than average to train.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=754.9s	754.9	 My hypothesis is that curiosity and intelligence are closely related.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=910.6s	910.6	 you're going to see, man, you could do so much better if you just did this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=913.7s	913.7	 But a lot of people, if you try to give them especially unsolicited dog training advice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=919.0s	919.0	 they're not likely to pick up what you're putting down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=921.1s	921.1	 and it can be very frustrating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=922.4s	922.4	 And so the question is, how do I deal with it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=924.1s	924.1	 I really like to see what science has to say on the matter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=926.9s	926.9	 because the fact is, no matter how much experience any of us have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=930.6s	930.6	 it's no substitute for the body of science that exists on dog behavior right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=934.7s	934.7	 And while it certainly needs to be improved,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=936.8s	936.8	 and it certainly needs to grow and get better and more detailed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=939.8s	939.8	 it's better than anything we have right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=942.2s	942.2	 When you're trying to use modern science and ethics to train a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=945.8s	945.8	 there's a little bit of a learning curve,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=947.2s	947.2	 and that is our biggest hurdle as a dog training YouTube channel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=951.0s	951.0	 have we talked about Dunning-Kruger on this channel?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=953.5s	953.5	 Not in enough detail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=954.6s	954.6	 So the Dunning-Kruger effect, the horizontal axis is experience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=959.1s	959.1	 and your vertical axis is confidence on whatever it is that's being discussed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=964.9s	964.9	 This dotted line indicates what there is to know on the topic, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=968.6s	968.6	 That is the information, and one's ability to get that information and internalize it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=973.7s	973.7	 takes time down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=975.3s	975.3	 And ask yourself where you might be struggling with this in your own life, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=979.6s	979.6	 I think it's valuable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=980.5s	980.5	 I think most of us are on Mount Stupid for most things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=983.1s	983.1	 So there's this thing you can see here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=984.7s	984.7	 Mount Stupid is where your confidence is above where it should be given your experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=991.4s	991.4	 And you don't know it because you don't know what you don't know until you know it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=993.8s	993.8	 So many of us are on Mount Stupid in so many various aspects of our life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=998.3s	998.3	 You're up there, you think you know about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1000.7s	1000.7	 but you're completely unaware that you are way off base.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1003.8s	1003.8	 And you realize it, you're like, holy cow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1006.4s	1006.4	 If you take a good faith effort and analyze something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1008.7s	1008.7	 and you realize, you know what?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1010.6s	1010.6	 There's so much that you don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1012.6s	1012.6	 I need to come to terms with, I don't know very much about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1016.5s	1016.5	 That's when we take the dip into what's known as the valley of despair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1020.9s	1020.9	 You have this sudden awakening and realize, whoa,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1024.1s	1024.1	 there's an overwhelming amount of stuff to learn about dog training that I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1028.2s	1028.2	 Or anything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1029.1s	1029.1	 Or anything, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1030.2s	1030.2	 I want this to be a broad point because I don't want to come off like, oh, here I am.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1033.5s	1033.5	 I am an expert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1034.4s	1034.4	 It's more that, like, I think it's interesting when I look at myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1038.7s	1038.7	 and find places where I've been on Mount Stupid before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1040.9s	1040.9	 So you start on Mount Stupid sometimes, you take the plunge into the valley of despair,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1045.8s	1045.8	 and then over time, as you gain experience, you become more knowledgeable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1050.3s	1050.3	 And confident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1051.3s	1051.3	 And confident on what you're talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1053.7s	1053.7	 And then it's real, legitimate confidence because you actually have learned something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1058.3s	1058.3	 Which is why you don't go above the dotted line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1060.8s	1060.8	 Because you actually know what there is to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1062.7s	1062.7	 Well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1063.1s	1063.1	 So you're not on Mount Stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1064.5s	1064.5	 More importantly, you know what there is that isn't known, too, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1067.3s	1067.3	 Which is going to be a lot of things in just about any topic you can imagine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1070.6s	1070.6	 The point is that most of the population, as it relates to training dogs, is on Mount Stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1076.7s	1076.7	 I mean that affectionately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1077.8s	1077.8	 And I get that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1078.6s	1078.6	 There's other things to learn about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1080.2s	1080.2	 There's other things to know about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1082.0s	1082.0	 But I think as long as we're aware that we're on Mount Stupid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1085.8s	1085.8	 we can at least get into the valley of despair and start to make progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1090.0s	1090.0	 Understanding that there's a lot that we don't know of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf51cuFS87I&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=1091.8s	1091.8	 Yes.
