https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 When we first got him, we had an issue where he went to protect his bone while he was in his crate and inertia got nearby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=7.1s	7.1	 What I don't want to do is just go in and take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=9.2s	9.2	 There's a moose in our backyard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 Ever since mankind has existed, we've wondered, what is my mix breed dog made of?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=18.8s	18.8	 Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=20.6s	20.6	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=21.2s	21.2	 Yes, go!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 This is Reality Dog Training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 Subscribe and click the bell so you never miss an episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=28.8s	28.8	 Here's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 We brought this wild street dog into our home to try to teach him some manners so that somebody would want to adopt him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 And well, when you bring a new dog into your life, it takes some time for them to open up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=41.8s	41.8	 So Chop has been slowly coming out of his shell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=44.8s	44.8	 And while he's been settling in, of course I've not been perfect about preventing every single possible bad thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=50.8s	50.8	 Ah, jeez, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 And listen, I'm a dog trainer, so deep down I know that the best possible thing that I can do is keep Chop from establishing bad habits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=61.8s	61.8	 I can't choose every single battle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 And this is something that even a lot of professional dog trainers disagree on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=67.8s	67.8	 And of course, this is bound to trip some people up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=69.8s	69.8	 They feel like they have to be 100% consistent all of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=74.8s	74.8	 But in reality, that can be a lot more complicated than it seems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 I believe it's really important to be tolerant and patient when dogs are adjusting to their new life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 And so here we are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 Excuse you. Excuse you. What are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 I'm trying not to touch him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=90.8s	90.8	 At a principle here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=92.8s	92.8	 Good man! That's right. And he made the correct decision there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 That's the first time I've caught him jumping on the furniture, but I'll be looking for him to think about it or attempt it moving forward here and try to show him how to appropriately act.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=106.8s	106.8	 Okay, our Vienna sausage leather pillows are not a toy, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=114.8s	114.8	 No, sir. That's that's not a dog toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=118.8s	118.8	 Leave it. Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 All right. So his house training needs work in general, just general conduct in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=129.8s	129.8	 You know, he keeps going at the carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=132.8s	132.8	 I've had to get on him in an arena a couple of times this morning and see his cool there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=138.8s	138.8	 But I'm determined to make sure he spends way more time outside of the crate today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=144.8s	144.8	 That's the only way he's going to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 It's a good time to do it right now with all that rain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=149.8s	149.8	 And Chop seems to understand the assignment, which is apparently to spend the entire day finding things to get into.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 I really thought we had dog proof this house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=158.8s	158.8	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=159.8s	159.8	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=161.8s	161.8	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=165.8s	165.8	 This is what I do when dogs grab things they're not supposed to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 In the real world, you have to balance bonding with your dog and training and enforcing the rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=174.8s	174.8	 And just getting to know one another very well is pretty much the most important thing when you're training it on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 Good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=183.8s	183.8	 Another thing we've been working on is showing Chop how to share his toys more politely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 And he's been doing much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=191.8s	191.8	 Why you gotta steal hers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 OK, I said he's better. He's not perfect yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=196.8s	196.8	 But fortunately, my dog, Inertia, is just great at sharing her toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=200.8s	200.8	 Even though sometimes Chop will be way more intrigued by any toy that Inertia has possession of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=205.8s	205.8	 it seems like he's learning that sharing toys is much better than not sharing toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=211.8s	211.8	 Look at these two. Look how they are starting to trust one another, starting to build a relationship with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=216.8s	216.8	 And hopefully that will extend to other aspects of Chop's life moving on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=221.8s	221.8	 And this looks to me like a great boost in Chop's confidence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=224.8s	224.8	 I mean, you'll remember when he first came to us, he was much more defensive around possessions like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 And so far, with Inertia, we make sure to supervise him 100% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=235.8s	235.8	 And that's a good idea when you're getting to know any dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=238.8s	238.8	 By making sure we're methodically reinforcing Chop when he behaves well with Inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=242.8s	242.8	 and discontinuing play when he gets inappropriate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 we've been able to teach him that life is much better when you share with your friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=250.8s	250.8	 Of course, it's hard to blame him for wanting to play with these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=253.8s	253.8	 I mean, that cactus is from BarkBox.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 And the little fish Inertia has comes from SuperChewer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=258.8s	258.8	 And they make some of my favorite toys on Earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=260.8s	260.8	 Whether you choose BarkBox, which has fluffier toys, or SuperChewer for dogs who need tougher stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 it's likely that your dog is going to love the toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=268.8s	268.8	 And actually, Bark guarantees it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=270.8s	270.8	 The details are what matter about these toys, both in their imagination and their build quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 You can immediately tell SuperChewer boxes are heavier because they make tougher toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=280.8s	280.8	 Like, this is a very firm toy under here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=282.8s	282.8	 So even if your dog rips this off, you have a real, like, serious toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 See that? It's not like a plush toy. It bounces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=291.8s	291.8	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=295.8s	295.8	 In addition to the bed, they're even going to give you a free bark toy as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=299.8s	299.8	 This is a good deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=300.8s	300.8	 It really does come with a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=302.8s	302.8	 It's a pea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=304.8s	304.8	 You know Princess and the Pea Under the Mattress, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=306.8s	306.8	 All of you can get a free memory foam bed for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=310.8s	310.8	 And awesome toys and treats every month when you sign up for a BarkBox or SuperChewer box
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=314.8s	314.8	 at both of my special links in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=321.8s	321.8	 These guys continue to play out years away to pass the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=327.8s	327.8	 Enjoy each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=329.8s	329.8	 Their indoor play is getting very polite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=333.8s	333.8	 This is all part of getting him acclimated to living in a house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=336.8s	336.8	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=338.8s	338.8	 He's only recently started getting on his back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=340.8s	340.8	 And today it looks like he's taking it to a new level, just really getting on his back and staying there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=346.8s	346.8	 Or he's just stuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=348.8s	348.8	 Or he's just stuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=355.8s	355.8	 Of course, in her so taking advantage of the opportunity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=362.8s	362.8	 See the mirror, the mirroring play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=364.8s	364.8	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=368.8s	368.8	 It's funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=369.8s	369.8	 When dogs imitate one another during play, this has been correlated with them being on the same page, so to speak,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 and feeling great about their play session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=379.8s	379.8	 They're building trust with one another.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=387.8s	387.8	 There she goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=389.8s	389.8	 She's like, your turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=391.8s	391.8	 She still kicks her legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=393.8s	393.8	 Oh my God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=395.8s	395.8	 Yeah, he's in the mood to be on his back today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=397.8s	397.8	 That's so funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=398.8s	398.8	 Sometimes Inertia likes to put her whole mouth over Chop's neck, which he seems to be fine with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=404.8s	404.8	 Okay, whatever you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=406.8s	406.8	 You're happy. I'm happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=408.8s	408.8	 We've been working on this all morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=410.8s	410.8	 They've been romping around the house for, I don't know, the last couple hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=413.8s	413.8	 But, you know, give them enough time and the dogs will lie down and settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=418.8s	418.8	 I'm really determined to keep him out of the crate while I'm in the room today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=422.8s	422.8	 He's doing so much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=424.8s	424.8	 I really want to make sure this dog is acclimated to a residential home setting before I place him in a new home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=430.8s	430.8	 I heard you talking about the settle that's happening right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=433.8s	433.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=434.8s	434.8	 This is a continuation of a settle a few minutes ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=438.8s	438.8	 I don't know if you even realized this happened because you were really focused on working because it's Sunday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=443.8s	443.8	 So we just uploaded the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=444.8s	444.8	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=445.8s	445.8	 You were working on a thumbnail and Chop came up and kind of mouthed your iPad and you said, don't eat my iPad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=450.8s	450.8	 I need you to settle right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=452.8s	452.8	 And then he just kind of started standing there like thinking about what you said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=456.8s	456.8	 It appeared to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=457.8s	457.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=458.8s	458.8	 He was thinking about what you said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=459.8s	459.8	 And he was thinking so hard that I started filming because I was like, what's he going to do now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=464.8s	464.8	 Is he going to like, is he going to choose to be good?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=466.8s	466.8	 Like I felt like he was like, all right, I think I get that this guy wants me to chill or at least doesn't want me to bite his iPad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=472.8s	472.8	 So I filmed it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=473.8s	473.8	 He stood there thinking for the longest time, just still and thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=479.8s	479.8	 And then he settled and it felt like our best, most genuine in the house settle yet because it wasn't like we told him to settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=488.8s	488.8	 It was like we told him to, or we gave him a toy to pacify him or inertia said, hey Chop, we're settling right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=496.8s	496.8	 Like he just did it on his own and it was beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=499.8s	499.8	 I'm so proud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=500.8s	500.8	 It was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=501.8s	501.8	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=502.8s	502.8	 These early like relaxes or settles or whatever you want to call it when you're trying to get a dog used to their new home or any home for that matter as we're doing are really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=511.8s	511.8	 And you really have to work for these settles in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=514.8s	514.8	 But right now, I mean, this is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=516.8s	516.8	 Ever heard the expression, let sleeping dogs lie?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=518.8s	518.8	 And on that note, you might notice how low key my praise was when Chop that settled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=524.8s	524.8	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=526.8s	526.8	 And that's because I do want to keep Chop in that relaxed, calm state of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=532.8s	532.8	 And typically when I praise a dog, I tend to get really excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=536.8s	536.8	 Oh, chill, dude.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=541.8s	541.8	 Context.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=542.8s	542.8	 I think he actually went to sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=545.8s	545.8	 I love this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=546.8s	546.8	 Oh, it's so great to see him just happy in a living room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=550.8s	550.8	 He came from a pretty rough setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=553.8s	553.8	 Probably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=554.8s	554.8	 I met with some village dogs yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=555.8s	555.8	 There was one of them that was shot in the leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=559.8s	559.8	 So the rescue organization had amputated the leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=561.8s	561.8	 Dogs doing very well and happy and fortunately doing great as a tripod dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=565.8s	565.8	 But some people in this world just don't value dogs in the same way that other people do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=571.8s	571.8	 You'll remember when we first got him, we had an issue where he went to protect his bone while he was in his crate and inertia got nearby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=579.8s	579.8	 One of the things that I want to be able to do with Chop is to be able to take away something that he's really into, like a bone, without him reacting negatively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=587.8s	587.8	 I don't know that he would necessarily try and snap at me or anything, but I'd rather play it safe and set up a guaranteed success to get that bone away from him and kind of condition him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=598.8s	598.8	 Hopefully by the end of the lesson to be able to exchange the bone with me, I'm just trying to build that trust with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=603.8s	603.8	 What I don't want to do is just go in and take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=605.8s	605.8	 The reason dogs tend to guard things like that is because they value them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=609.8s	609.8	 They don't want you to take them away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=610.8s	610.8	 They're fearful they may never see the bone again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=613.8s	613.8	 Probably check out my books if you want a written guide to resource guarding and all sorts of other stuff, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=618.8s	618.8	 I want to use something really high value to get his attention off of that bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=622.8s	622.8	 What I'm going to do is I'm just going to drop a piece of chicken right near the bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=626.8s	626.8	 Since Chop seems to be feeling happy and calm, I'm going to work on teaching him that good things can actually happen when humans pick up his bones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=634.8s	634.8	 So by giving him bits of chicken that he loves while he lets me hold his bone, we're counter conditioning him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=640.8s	640.8	 That is changing his emotional response from one of defensiveness to one of acceptance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=646.8s	646.8	 This is a great way to really de-escalate your dog and put them at ease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=650.8s	650.8	 Good man. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=652.8s	652.8	 And I can pick up the bone. I can secure it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=655.8s	655.8	 That's really good. What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=657.8s	657.8	 Yes. Good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=660.8s	660.8	 Right now, he prefers the chicken to the bone. You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=663.8s	663.8	 That's exactly where I want him. See this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=666.8s	666.8	 Yes. Good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=668.8s	668.8	 Good boy. So right now he's showing no guarding behavior whatsoever around this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=674.8s	674.8	 That's really nice. That's very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=676.8s	676.8	 This exercise is important, but Chop tolerating a human near his bone is not the same as Chop tolerating another dog near his bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=684.8s	684.8	 Dog-to-dog resource guarding is a complex issue, but the first and most important step we need to take is to prevent it from being able to happen at all, ideally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=693.8s	693.8	 What I have been doing since that happened is really managing them, not leaving a bone out when they're playing, making sure I put these things up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=700.8s	700.8	 So I'm very much relying on management right now while I continue to build communication with them so it'll be easier to teach them more complex tasks like leave alone the thing that you want to protect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=712.8s	712.8	 The main priority with resource guarding for me right now is to make sure that I can get in and take something from him if I need to. That's really valuable to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=720.8s	720.8	 Good man. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=722.8s	722.8	 You never know when a young child or something is going to come up to a dog and try and take something from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=728.8s	728.8	 It's really important that they have experience with a person. So very good. Good job, buddy. All done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=734.8s	734.8	 We just got Chop's breed results and I've been more curious about his breed mix than any dog I have ever DNA tested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=742.8s	742.8	 I'm so excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=744.8s	744.8	 Ever since mankind has existed, we've wondered, what is my mixed breed dog made of?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=750.8s	750.8	 Are you cheating?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=751.8s	751.8	 What? Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=753.8s	753.8	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=754.8s	754.8	 Yes, go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=755.8s	755.8	 Okay, well I want to show you right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=760.8s	760.8	 High wolfiness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=762.8s	762.8	 High wolfiness. That makes so much sense because he's an Alaskan dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=766.8s	766.8	 1.5 percent. How do you want me to tell you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=769.8s	769.8	 In order of most abundant, no, least abundant to most abundant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=773.8s	773.8	 Least to most? Okay, okay, okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=775.8s	775.8	 So we started with wolfiness. Okay, then what percent is the next thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=780.8s	780.8	 It's 4 percent Akita.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=783.8s	783.8	 I had a hunch. Did I say that on camera? Because I did, you remember, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=788.8s	788.8	 10.2 percent Alaskan type Husky, which I think is cool that they have pinpointed that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=795.8s	795.8	 Because the next one is 12.4 percent Siberian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=800.8s	800.8	 I definitely have guessed that one, but that's a small percentage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=803.8s	803.8	 I'm thinking Malamute still, but go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=805.8s	805.8	 Malamute was also my top guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=807.8s	807.8	 There's only two left. 20.9 percent German Shepherd dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=821.8s	821.8	 It could. But okay, what percent?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=823.8s	823.8	 20.9. Only 20.9.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=826.8s	826.8	 Almost 21 percent. So it's not like he's a half Shepherd.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=828.8s	828.8	 So he's 80 percent not German Shepherd dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=831.8s	831.8	 If you combine the two Husky types, he's 23 percent Husky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=835.8s	835.8	 Okay, that. Siberian Alaskan.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=864.8s	864.8	 Come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=870.8s	870.8	 Oh, man. Okay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=875.8s	875.8	 And also, I've never heard of this one. What is that? Star Trek?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=879.8s	879.8	 Oh, I've never either. I know.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=885.8s	885.8	 But what's this thing? I'm going to click it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=905.8s	905.8	 And they can do that because of the maternal DNA.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=909.8s	909.8	 One of his parents was a pretty solid Lab mix.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dYTx35tm4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=171&pp=iAQB&t=968.8s	968.8	 There's a beast in our backyard. Chop, come up.
