https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Training a totally untrained dog is one thing, but trying to train them when your routine and environment are changing every single day does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=7.1s	7.1	 present a new set of challenges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=9.1s	9.1	 You know exactly like we're doing traveling across two nations on our way to Alaska.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=14.1s	14.1	 Subscribe to see the most dynamic dog training series we've ever made. Today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 I'm gonna show you how I train dogs to be obedient in the face of some of the deadliest animals in North America.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=24.5s	24.5	 In Ursa there's a moose over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 Which has become a very real concern with our new super mobile lifestyle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=30.3s	30.3	 And we continue to be reminded of how unpredictable things can really be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 Okay, we need to talk about something that happened while you were letting Veronica out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 Veronica went from totally fine to this crazy foamy mouth in just like a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 That is alarming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=44.8s	44.8	 The closest vet of any kind was 40 minutes away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 That is one of the risks of traveling like this too. We're often very far away from medical care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=52.7s	52.7	 I have a bunch of vet friends in my pocket. I can text and ask about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 Fuzzy is a telehealth service so that you can use the power of your iPhone videos, pictures, and actually get someone on the line via text.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 A medical professional like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 I spend about 300% less time panicking, googling doomsday scenarios about our dogs because I could just text Fuzzy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 So Samantha at Fuzzy was awesome. I shared the video with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=75.9s	75.9	 She told me she thought Veronica's stomach might have been upset or something I had no idea about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=80.7s	80.7	 She said the dogs sometimes get super drooly when they get a hit of a certain kind of pheromone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=85.9s	85.9	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 So then she gave me a bunch of advice. Thank you Samantha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=89.2s	89.2	 You scared us so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=91.2s	91.2	 So they've agreed to give everyone a seven-day trial completely free of Fuzzy to try out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=95.7s	95.7	 See if you like it. See if it's as good as we're saying it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=98.2s	98.2	 We'll have a link below, youarefuzzy.com slash Zach to get that free trial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=101.7s	101.7	 We had just gotten settled in the Rocky Mountains.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 And wouldn't you know it, we were taking a walk down this forest road and we saw a huge moose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=110.4s	110.4	 These are the moments that as a dog trainer are particularly important to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 I mean look, I know that we're giving advice to so many people all around the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=117.7s	117.7	 I have to make sure this advice in practice is working with my own dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 Nature isn't always guaranteed to forgive you if your dog screws up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=125.3s	125.3	 I'm gonna give him his distance but I got my bear spray ready.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 Well you have to test them to make sure they work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=131.5s	131.5	 This is bear spray.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 I'm telling you, when you're out here in this part of the country, we don't go anywhere without this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=136.9s	136.9	 They're the most dangerous animal out here, even though there's bears and other predators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=141.7s	141.7	 He's watching us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=142.6s	142.6	 Yeah, they'll stop you to death. They will kill you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 They'll kill your dog if your dog charges them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 That's why we spend so much time focusing on the multitude of ways to train, stay, and come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 And in every conceivable context that we possibly can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 In Ursa there's a moose over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=157.3s	157.3	 I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 Yeah, she sees him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 That's a moose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=160.8s	160.8	 At our home in Alaska, we've seen moose in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=163.3s	163.3	 But like through the window or in the yard maybe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 All in a place where there was a layer of safety should things have gone south.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=170.9s	170.9	 And Ursa barks at him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=172.1s	172.1	 Yeah, she likes to bark at a lot of moose-like animals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=174.3s	174.3	 For more long-time viewers who have seen how I've trained Ursa around ungulates,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 you'll know that it's been a process to get her to be obedient anytime she detects any type of large mammal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 When she was a puppy and I would take her to the French Quarter in New Orleans,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=187.2s	187.2	 we would encounter mules and she would lose her mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=190.8s	190.8	 Because Ursa is more naturally reactive to those things than some other dogs are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=195.5s	195.5	 Fortunately, she's doing really well and continues to impress us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 So here's what I'm thinking at this moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 I'm like, all right, I put in the work with In Ursa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=202.8s	202.8	 I want to test my training at a safe distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 So the moose looks relatively stable as long as I don't get probably one inch closer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=210.9s	210.9	 You've gotten to know moose a little better now than you used to know them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 I wonder if I could train a moose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=215.8s	215.8	 In Ursa, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=218.5s	218.5	 So that's the first instance of me being able to call In Ursa off of a moose without a wall between us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=224.4s	224.4	 I've done training like this in our Alaska house where she would see one out the window
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=227.8s	227.8	 and I was able to call her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 Moose in our backyard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=230.7s	230.7	 But here, you know, she definitely was perked up and focused on the moose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 Now it's able to say In Ursa, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 And she did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=237.4s	237.4	 Yeah, I'm talking about you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=238.9s	238.9	 Good job, In Ursa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=240.2s	240.2	 That was really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=241.2s	241.2	 I just picked Veronica up because we are not there yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=244.4s	244.4	 She's still so young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=245.5s	245.5	 I can't expect her to have this kind of impulse control right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=248.6s	248.6	 And when we're encountering a wild animal and we're with our dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=251.5s	251.5	 our attitude is pretty much to de-escalate or get away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 We don't want our dogs barking at animals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 Yeah, dogs have a way of escalating the situation when they see a wild animal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 That's usually not what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=263.8s	263.8	 I hate to say this to you guys, but there's no way to train your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=266.6s	266.6	 how to magically not be intrigued by wild animals all at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=271.8s	271.8	 I'm going to show you how we go about training Veronica to be obedient around wild animals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 Yeah, that's the cool thing about this series is we can just literally show you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 like in real life as we do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=283.8s	283.8	 What do you guys think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=284.6s	284.6	 Are you guys enjoying the real time training where we're literally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=287.7s	287.7	 showing you multiple examples in real life as they occur?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=290.8s	290.8	 One area of improvement for Veronica that she desperately needs is stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=295.4s	295.4	 I mean, she's really good at stay when I say sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=300.5s	300.5	 And I even move around a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=304.2s	304.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=305.3s	305.3	 And I release her from the state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=306.5s	306.5	 She's doing really good with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=308.0s	308.0	 Really, that's only one type of state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=309.8s	309.8	 Traditionally, we dog trainers think of stay in three broad categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=313.8s	313.8	 Stay for a period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 Stay with distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=316.2s	316.2	 That's when we're farther away from our dog and stay while distracted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=320.8s	320.8	 which is when they stay when something is moving or exciting them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 and they summon the self-discipline to hold that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=327.4s	327.4	 Of course, Veronica has a long way to go with her self-discipline.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=331.3s	331.3	 Right there, she's distracted by something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=334.6s	334.6	 Very alert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 This isn't just a yappy bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=336.8s	336.8	 This is a dog who sees something, the wind blowing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=340.0s	340.0	 I'm not sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=340.6s	340.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=341.5s	341.5	 I'm going to go ahead and acknowledge the fact that she came back to me there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=344.6s	344.6	 I'm letting her bark intentionally here to satisfy her curiosity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=348.2s	348.2	 given where we are right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=349.6s	349.6	 Also, it could be a bear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=351.1s	351.1	 It's so tempting to discipline barking, but keep in mind, dogs need to bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=356.6s	356.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=357.4s	357.4	 It's a natural expression for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=359.8s	359.8	 Granted, we don't want them doing it all the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=361.7s	361.7	 but to expect the dog to be quiet all the time is just not ethical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 The real question for me is, can I get her under control after a brief barking outburst?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=370.3s	370.3	 Then hopefully we can minimize unwanted barking over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 That's because if you're trying to resolve a behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=375.4s	375.4	 you want to understand why they're barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=377.4s	377.4	 I think a lot of people will look at that and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=378.8s	378.8	 Zack, you're just letting her bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=380.1s	380.1	 You're not addressing it at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 I'm doubling down on this idea that it's important for her to be able to express emotion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=386.5s	386.5	 she's having within reason, allow her to adapt for a second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 and then try to communicate with her once her state of excitement is a little bit lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=394.6s	394.6	 In the spirit of positive reinforcement training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=396.4s	396.4	 my emphasis is on letting her know what I do like instead of what I don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=400.5s	400.5	 It is shocking how much progress you can make with that strategy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=404.4s	404.4	 We really continue negotiating this barking issue while trying to train other things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=409.7s	409.7	 like stay in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=411.4s	411.4	 I think the problem that most of us have with stay is when our dog wants to go after something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=415.8s	415.8	 You can say, stay all day long, but if I say, stay, and I throw that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=421.1s	421.1	 you see how she just went after it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=422.9s	422.9	 She needs to know to hold stay when she's distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=425.6s	425.6	 That could have just as easily been a sprinting moose out of the forest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=429.6s	429.6	 or a bear while we're taking a walk, or a pronghorn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=433.0s	433.0	 Wow, look, they hopped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=434.3s	434.3	 They did the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=435.3s	435.3	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=436.5s	436.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=441.5s	441.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=445.7s	445.7	 See how she wants to come towards me when I put her in that stay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=449.1s	449.1	 Just asking her to sit in this context is asking her to stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=451.6s	451.6	 but also use the word stay because it certainly can't hurt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=454.4s	454.4	 So sit means stay and stay means stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=457.0s	457.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=457.4s	457.4	 Why even teach stay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=458.7s	458.7	 Often when I'm teaching more nuanced behaviors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=461.3s	461.3	 it's a really good thing to be able to pause your dog right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=464.9s	464.9	 Like say you're teaching bow and you want to be able to be like, stay right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=468.4s	468.4	 Stay means freeze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=469.8s	469.8	 Sit means hold that position until you're released.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=472.3s	472.3	 So does down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=473.1s	473.1	 Are your pencils on fire?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=474.8s	474.8	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=476.5s	476.5	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=478.4s	478.4	 It's called stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=479.7s	479.7	 I'm trying to be able to back away a sec, come here and give her a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=485.6s	485.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=490.0s	490.0	 The goal is to have her hold that sit position, which she's not quite doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=494.0s	494.0	 The thing about Veronica though, is she tends to close that distance by breaking stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=498.1s	498.1	 coming up a few inches and then sitting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=500.6s	500.6	 So I really think I need to make this easier for her by promptly acknowledging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=504.6s	504.6	 successful stays more quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=507.3s	507.3	 Now stay with me and you're going to be able to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=509.5s	509.5	 You're going to see this evolve quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=511.8s	511.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=512.3s	512.3	 I know it looks like I'm using a lot of treats here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=514.2s	514.2	 Keep in mind, these are tiny treats, but they're very high quality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=517.4s	517.4	 See how I'm building the distance and promptly rewarding?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=520.3s	520.3	 I'm not combining distance with a period of time right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=523.6s	523.6	 She is just going nuts over the ground sense,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=525.8s	525.8	 really making our training extra challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=528.2s	528.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=531.0s	531.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=534.6s	534.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=536.2s	536.2	 And I love how we're not having to intervene and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=538.6s	538.6	 no, no, when she's not doing the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=541.2s	541.2	 If your dog isn't doing the thing you want, break it down smaller,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=544.4s	544.4	 catch them succeeding and when you get that tiny bit of traction, that's all you need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=548.6s	548.6	 And this is why positive reinforcement is so powerful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=551.7s	551.7	 You don't wait for them to fail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=552.7s	552.7	 It's predictable she's going to fail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=554.3s	554.3	 So I don't want to correct her when she fails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=556.6s	556.6	 I want to celebrate her when she's succeeding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=560.2s	560.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=561.8s	561.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=562.3s	562.3	 Instead of having to do this bass dancing with her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=564.7s	564.7	 I really need to try to teach her how to slow dance now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=569.6s	569.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=572.0s	572.0	 See how I'm slowing down the rate at which I'm rewarding now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=579.6s	579.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=585.7s	585.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=587.1s	587.1	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=589.8s	589.8	 So a little bit better that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=591.9s	591.9	 You saw how we went from yes, yes, yes to yes, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=599.6s	599.6	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=602.6s	602.6	 I think a lot of people will see that is too many treats right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=605.7s	605.7	 That is not realistic for everyday people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=607.9s	607.9	 There's a path forward to not being reliant on treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=610.5s	610.5	 And as counterintuitive as it is, the trick is to use more treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=614.2s	614.2	 especially in the beginning of training something new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=616.2s	616.2	 Yeah, the fastest way to get to using less treats is to use more treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=620.7s	620.7	 It's no different than when you're a kid and your teacher gives you candy or whatever their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=624.8s	624.8	 reinforcement was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=626.0s	626.0	 You don't require candy to solve two plus two anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=629.0s	629.0	 You learn how to do the thing without the reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=631.4s	631.4	 But in the beginning, it's very helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=633.0s	633.0	 For new tasks, I like to use a really top notch, high quality treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=637.4s	637.4	 We've been using Pupford as a substitute for real meat all the time on this trip for obvious reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=642.7s	642.7	 It's not really a substitute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=643.8s	643.8	 It is real meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=644.6s	644.6	 That's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=645.0s	645.0	 But it's freeze dried.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=646.4s	646.4	 And so you can put it in your pocket without being nasty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=650.2s	650.2	 Getting caught without treats is the easiest mistake to make as a new trainer or even an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=655.5s	655.5	 experienced one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=656.5s	656.5	 Literally, my morning routine at this point is I wake up, I grab a handful of freeze dried
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=661.0s	661.0	 chicken and I shove them in the pocket of my jeans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=664.0s	664.0	 The most effective known way to teach another animal is through reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=669.9s	669.9	 So by giving them a treat that they really like, you're sealing in that behavior more and more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=675.0s	675.0	 And the great thing about Pupford is they have so many different types of super high quality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=679.7s	679.7	 treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=680.1s	680.1	 We'll have a link in the description where you can check out Pupford's awesome treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=683.8s	683.8	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=684.3s	684.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=688.2s	688.2	 Oh, we got a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=692.5s	692.5	 This is the thing about training in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=695.3s	695.3	 Things like that are going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=696.3s	696.3	 You're going to see off leash dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=697.6s	697.6	 We saw an off leash moose earlier today and we're asking for it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=701.4s	701.4	 We're out here in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=702.2s	702.2	 We're trying to experience the world and all of those random things that the world has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=706.4s	706.4	 But there is such little room for error.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=709.2s	709.2	 And with her being a small dog, there's even less room for error.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=712.2s	712.2	 Being alert at all times is really important when you're training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=715.9s	715.9	 She seems to understand stay in a limited capacity unless something exciting happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=720.6s	720.6	 And I don't know about you guys, but that's when I want my dog to stay the most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=724.4s	724.4	 She's demonstrated that she wants to chase a moving stick or rock or whatever it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=728.8s	728.8	 My objective is to keep her from doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=731.0s	731.0	 And then hopefully once she understands that, I can build on that for her to start generalizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=736.4s	736.4	 when a number of moving or exciting things happen around her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=739.6s	739.6	 In other words, we're trying to teach her more mature impulse control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=743.2s	743.2	 So I'm going to zoom in on the action here and go in slow motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=748.1s	748.1	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=748.4s	748.4	 So here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=749.3s	749.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=750.6s	750.6	 At this point, honestly, I don't care if it's a down stay, a sit stay or a stand stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=754.3s	754.3	 I just don't want her going after this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=757.3s	757.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=759.4s	759.4	 By making these movements more subtle and slowing them down and allowing her time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=764.4s	764.4	 to process what I'm asking, Veronica is more likely to succeed than if I were to throw the stick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=770.0s	770.0	 several feet away, really fast, several times in a row.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=772.8s	772.8	 If your dog is failing, that's because you're asking too much of them and they haven't been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=776.6s	776.6	 appropriately set up for the thing you're asking them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=779.0s	779.0	 Full stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=779.6s	779.6	 We have to take accountability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=781.6s	781.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=782.4s	782.4	 I am going to start to teach her the word stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=784.8s	784.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=786.7s	786.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=787.5s	787.5	 When she's in a sit or when she's in a down, it's implied that she needs to hold that position and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=792.1s	792.1	 stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=792.6s	792.6	 However, I'll still use the word stay in combination with these behaviors sometimes as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=797.6s	797.6	 Let's try a rock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=798.6s	798.6	 That's significant because it's a completely different object this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=801.8s	801.8	 It's not a stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=802.8s	802.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=803.6s	803.6	 And she knows that and she's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=805.9s	805.9	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=807.2s	807.2	 Typically, the risk of failure is going to be higher when a variable like this is changed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=811.5s	811.5	 which is why I want to get her used to staying in a variety of different contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=815.7s	815.7	 Sometimes a stick flies past her, sometimes a rock drops from the sky,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=819.6s	819.6	 and sometimes a dog runs down the road.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=822.0s	822.0	 Ultimately, in the future, I'm going to expect her to stay in all of these circumstances as she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=826.9s	826.9	 develops these skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=828.2s	828.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=828.9s	828.9	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=829.5s	829.5	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=830.2s	830.2	 You're probably noticing how I'm doing something a little different by training her to stay for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=834.2s	834.2	 that distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=835.0s	835.0	 I'm really close to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=836.3s	836.3	 Dogs are much more likely to listen to us the closer we are to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=839.9s	839.9	 So when introducing a really tough concept for a dog, like stay when you want to go,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=845.0s	845.0	 being close to them is likely to help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=846.6s	846.6	 Before, when I would suddenly surprise her and throw a stick, she instantly broke her stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=851.0s	851.0	 But let's see if I can duplicate that same action, but have her stay this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=854.8s	854.8	 Veronica here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=856.0s	856.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=857.8s	857.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=860.2s	860.2	 And so there, I'm trying to surprise her a bit more and not give her as much notice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=864.5s	864.5	 You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=865.0s	865.0	 I just want to point out how we haven't had to use any type of physical correction at any point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=869.8s	869.8	 during any of this training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=871.2s	871.2	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=872.9s	872.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=874.3s	874.3	 So now look what we're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=875.4s	875.4	 We're adding the distraction while I'm moving a little farther away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=879.3s	879.3	 So we're combining both elements, distance and distraction in one lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=883.4s	883.4	 That's some fancy schmancy dog training right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=886.5s	886.5	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=888.6s	888.6	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1096.6s	1096.6	 It hasn't seen the light of day in millions of years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1098.7s	1098.7	 I know. Now it does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1099.7s	1099.7	 She's like, why are we tasting these rocks?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1101.5s	1101.5	 What do you think? Does it taste ancient?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1103.1s	1103.1	 Heads up, if we have any geologists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1105.4s	1105.4	 or people who are really interested in rocks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1107.8s	1107.8	 I'm probably going to have a lot of questions moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1110.3s	1110.3	 You can email him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1112.0s	1112.0	 And I found these awesome plants, and they're so cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1115.0s	1115.0	 And I really want to take Veronica's picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1117.0s	1117.0	 And she will not stay, even with a tree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1118.7s	1118.7	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1119.4s	1119.4	 Oh, of course you're perfect now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1120.5s	1120.5	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1121.1s	1121.1	 Oh my gosh, it's beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1122.5s	1122.5	 This was a really productive outing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1124.1s	1124.1	 and it was time to go back and rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1125.8s	1125.8	 And you would like to think that that meant,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1127.7s	1127.7	 oh, OK, I'm done dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1129.5s	1129.5	 Not with our guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1131.8s	1131.8	 And Nersha has seen a teakettle for the first time, I think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1135.0s	1135.0	 It's OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1135.6s	1135.6	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1137.0s	1137.0	 Veronica, it's in the kitchen, silly dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1139.7s	1139.7	 I know, that's annoying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1141.8s	1141.8	 I thought it tells us that it's done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1143.8s	1143.8	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1145.0s	1145.0	 Good job, Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1146.2s	1146.2	 That was so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1148.4s	1148.4	 Veronica, sweetheart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1150.9s	1150.9	 Good, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1151.8s	1151.8	 I like that you looked at me that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1156.6s	1156.6	 Quiet, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1158.4s	1158.4	 That's right, quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1160.1s	1160.1	 She's definitely starting to know what quiet and relax means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1165.2s	1165.2	 Or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1170.0s	1170.0	 And as we've talked about many times with Veronica,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1172.3s	1172.3	 barking is natural for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1174.5s	1174.5	 In many, if not most cases, when dogs bark,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1176.6s	1176.6	 they're expressing a very real emotion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1178.9s	1178.9	 And learning to understand that emotion rather than just label it as,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1182.2s	1182.2	 oh, I don't want to hear that because it doesn't make sense to me, is helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1185.6s	1185.6	 Ultimately, long term, we want our dogs to be able to vocalize and express emotions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1189.4s	1189.4	 We just want them to do it in a way that is less offensive to us people, I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1193.8s	1193.8	 In the same way that kids scream and cry a lot of the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1196.6s	1196.6	 it's because they don't know how to talk or express their emotions yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1201.9s	1201.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1203.7s	1203.7	 Girl, looking at me and behaving nicely is what gets you stuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1208.8s	1208.8	 Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1211.5s	1211.5	 Here, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1212.8s	1212.8	 But really, her barking is starting to become more reserved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1215.6s	1215.6	 It is starting to become quieter in many more instances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1218.5s	1218.5	 Relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1220.2s	1220.2	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1221.0s	1221.0	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1222.2s	1222.2	 Relax doesn't just mean lie down for three seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1224.8s	1224.8	 It means chill out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1225.9s	1225.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1228.6s	1228.6	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1230.6s	1230.6	 And repeat as necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1232.6s	1232.6	 Sometimes when I do this, she barks as soon as she gets her treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1235.9s	1235.9	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1236.3s	1236.3	 But I feel like she's starting to get the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1237.7s	1237.7	 Well, then you don't just stop there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1238.8s	1238.8	 I think you got to now follow up every 30 seconds or 10 seconds or two seconds or five minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1243.4s	1243.4	 depending on where you are in the training, depending on that particular context,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1248.6s	1248.6	 how riled up is the dog in that moment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1250.5s	1250.5	 Are they easier to work with or are they really over threshold?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1253.8s	1253.8	 You got to weigh all of those variables in every individual situation with every individual dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1259.6s	1259.6	 And I've been trying to do that, but you're definitely making faster progress, although...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1264.7s	1264.7	 Veronica, hey, can you relax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1267.4s	1267.4	 Notice her processing my request, then looking out of the window,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1271.3s	1271.3	 maybe thinking about barking, and then looking back at me and ultimately relaxing as requested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1278.2s	1278.2	 Yay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1278.8s	1278.8	 And show them how you look when you say relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1280.8s	1280.8	 I've been filming her in case she does it because I don't want to miss it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1282.7s	1282.7	 I try not to let her see a tree, you know, because I don't want it to have to be contingent upon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1287.1s	1287.1	 getting a tree for her to do the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1288.6s	1288.6	 So it's relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1290.0s	1290.0	 With a hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1290.9s	1290.9	 Yeah, relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1292.0s	1292.0	 That's how I do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1292.8s	1292.8	 I mean, you know, you could do relax if you wanted, but you could do relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1296.6s	1296.6	 It doesn't really matter what you do, but...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1299.4s	1299.4	 Relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1299.8s	1299.8	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1300.5s	1300.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1300.8s	1300.8	 And see, this is a more proper relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1302.5s	1302.5	 You can see her position here, how she's curled up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1305.0s	1305.0	 She's not in that way, sphinx down or looking for another tree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1308.8s	1308.8	 Seems like she's starting to understand the concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1311.1s	1311.1	 These are what I'm most proud of with these videos is we are really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1314.2s	1314.2	 capturing the transitional behaviors leading up to the completed behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1317.9s	1317.9	 Oh, I love a good settle scene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1319.7s	1319.7	 It's so satisfying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1320.7s	1320.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1321.0s	1321.0	 Because that is a hard thing to capture on video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1323.0s	1323.0	 Yeah, you can't just like show how to train an organic settle and like a setup training lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1327.8s	1327.8	 You really have to capture it in the moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1329.7s	1329.7	 Yeah, as it happens for real.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMvtcP1rWQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=133&pp=iAQB&t=1331.5s	1331.5	 That's normal.
