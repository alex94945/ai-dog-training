https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Over the last couple of weeks or so, literally hundreds of you have asked me to make this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 Now I could not agree more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=8.3s	8.3	 I think this is one of the most important skills that our dogs need to know, that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 staying at the doorway when it's open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=14.5s	14.5	 It's a potentially life-saving skill and this should be prioritized very early on in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 Now would also be a good time to click subscribe to be notified every time I upload a new video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=25.9s	25.9	 Consider sharing this video too because the more people that know how to teach this to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 their dogs, the safer their dogs will be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=32.1s	32.1	 I also want you to notice how we're able to teach a pretty advanced stay here without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=36.5s	36.5	 having to use any force at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 We don't even have to use a leash and a collar to teach this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=41.6s	41.6	 True dog training is about communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 Before just jumping right in, you'll want to make sure that you've taught your dog how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 to stay for a period of time first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=49.6s	49.6	 Whenever we're teaching our dogs stay for a period of time, we want to set them up for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=53.5s	53.5	 success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=54.5s	54.5	 We go for something really easy in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=56.5s	56.5	 So it's stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 One, two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=59.2s	59.2	 Two seconds stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=60.2s	60.2	 All that clicking sound means is that Lexi did something good and I'm going to follow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 it up with a reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 For an introduction to clicker training, see the description of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=68.7s	68.7	 Stay one, two, three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=71.3s	71.3	 Beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 Just for a period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=73.7s	73.7	 We don't want to push them and push them until they break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=75.8s	75.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=76.8s	76.8	 Do you know what I'm saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 Stay one, two, three, four, five.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 Your dog should also know stay while you walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=84.9s	84.9	 I feel good with her on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 I think she's ready for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=87.8s	87.8	 So I'm going to do stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 See how I moved away just a few inches there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 I'm going to actually try and do stay while standing up because remember this training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 bubble is in effect right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=97.4s	97.4	 She's much more responsive when we're close to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=100.6s	100.6	 But we want her to ultimately be responsive when we're far from her and we do that by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=104.7s	104.7	 easing her into that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=106.2s	106.2	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=107.2s	107.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=108.2s	108.2	 I like to be very obvious with my hand signal as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 Just to be crystal clear, dogs are going to be more responsive to hand signals like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=116.2s	116.2	 at this age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 Since a four month old dog has not yet built a very large vocabulary, body language is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 extra important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=122.9s	122.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=123.9s	123.9	 Getting farther and farther.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=126.9s	126.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=127.9s	127.9	 Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 And always, you know, go at a slow pace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=130.8s	130.8	 Don't try and rush them into this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=132.8s	132.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 One, two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 And again, I want to see that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=138.5s	138.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=139.5s	139.5	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=140.5s	140.5	 I pushed her to failure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=141.5s	141.5	 It's okay if your dog breaks stay in these early stages of teaching them, but have the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=145.5s	145.5	 foresight to know that they're likely going to break again if you do it at the same distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 I don't want her to fail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=152.3s	152.3	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=153.3s	153.3	 So I'm going to make it easier for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=155.7s	155.7	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=157.7s	157.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=158.7s	158.7	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=159.7s	159.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=160.7s	160.7	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=161.7s	161.7	 Now, once she's doing that, we're going to introduce stay with distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=169.1s	169.1	 Check this out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=170.1s	170.1	 In this case, we're going to put Turkey in front of Lexi and see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=175.2s	175.2	 That last one had movement to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=176.9s	176.9	 That's why she jumped a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 When something has movement to it, our dogs are a lot more likely to chase it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=181.1s	181.1	 I felt like Lexi was pretty warmed up and receptive to learning something new, so on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=185.1s	185.1	 to the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=186.1s	186.1	 I do have a safety net here with the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=187.7s	187.7	 I would never want to do this too early with a dog without having a backup if she did run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=191.3s	191.3	 out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=192.3s	192.3	 She's likely to want to go out the door when I open it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=193.3s	193.3	 Is that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=194.3s	194.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 Most dogs who get hit by cars, this is how it happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=196.8s	196.8	 Be one step ahead of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=198.2s	198.2	 Be prepared to interact with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=199.8s	199.8	 Don't wait until you have to open the door on a moment's notice to hope that they stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 If she tries to run out, I'm going to say the word no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 Every time I say the word no, there's a consequence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 The consequence in this case is simply closing the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=211.7s	211.7	 Whenever we say no to our dogs, it should never come from a place of anger or frustration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 We're simply letting her know, no, that's not what I'm looking for here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 Let's try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=221.1s	221.1	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=223.1s	223.1	 And again, notice how I'm hunched down here, really communicating with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=227.1s	227.1	 I've got locked eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=228.1s	228.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 I'll even stand on the leash just in case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=234.1s	234.1	 I'm going to close the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=236.1s	236.1	 I'm going to reward her for not going.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 Go in slow motion when introducing new concepts like this to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=242.7s	242.7	 The best time to correct a broken stay is right before it occurs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS5__HZvwM&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=611&pp=iAQB&t=254.6s	254.6	 Give your dog 100% of your attention and be ready with a prompt yes to let them know that
