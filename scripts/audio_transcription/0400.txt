https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=26.4s	26.4	 But do dogs get confused when more than one person is teaching them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=29.9s	29.9	 That's what we're going to explore today.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 interesting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 It's a tongue toy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=59.1s	59.1	 Look at this fat parrot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=62.1s	62.1	 It's really biteable, there's a squeaky toy in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 That is a good dog toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 I told you this would wake you up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 Callie hasn't even discovered that there's treats in here yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 She's going to go nuts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 Okay, I guess so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=83.3s	83.3	 There's two different kinds of treats in this bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=85.6s	85.6	 One is fish and one is chips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=87.8s	87.8	 Definitely smells like fish.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=100.5s	100.5	 who have different ideas about training and what's most important?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=107.3s	107.3	 most committed to training take charge, accept responsibility and manage the raising and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 That's not to say though that each person in the house can't have their own unique

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 understanding the rules, what's acceptable and what isn't and how you expect them to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=128.7s	128.7	 The purpose of having a designated trainer isn't that they're the only one who gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=131.5s	131.5	 to spend time with a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 Everybody should be spending lots of time with a dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=140.8s	140.8	 with the dog during the communication building phase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=143.5s	143.5	 You know, the first few months of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=145.3s	145.3	 It's totally possible to have two people in the household be the primary trainer, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=148.9s	148.9	 we'll talk about that in a minute.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=154.1s	154.1	 in the house and making sure that everyone is on the same page as far as training methods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 and consistency are concerned.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=163.7s	163.7	 household, well, at least with matters relating to the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 Dogs learn best when they have solid leadership and things are well structured, just like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 kids do.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=176.8s	176.8	 figuring out in very short order who's going to enforce certain rules and who isn't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=181.8s	181.8	 But of course, there can be more than one primary trainer in a household.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 However, if this is your situation, you'll need to be very consistent about holding your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 dog to identical standards that you and the other trainer have agreed upon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=193.6s	193.6	 But the thing is, if one trainer is more serious about training than the other trainer, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=197.3s	197.3	 could really inhibit your progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=199.3s	199.3	 For example, if you're the primary trainer, you might teach your dog to sit by holding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 up a treat like this and saying sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=205.7s	205.7	 But another member of the household might tell the dog to sit by pointing like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 For a dog needed training, this is likely to make the concept take a little bit longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 to internalize since those are very different hand signals and the cadence of communication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 is so varied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=218.7s	218.7	 And this is much less efficient at a time where building that basic communication is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=223.2s	223.2	 critical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=224.2s	224.2	 However, once a dog really starts to understand something basic like sit, then it's pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=228.6s	228.6	 easy for other family members to use different hand signals or interact with a dog in a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 that's most natural for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 When you have an exceptionally strong bond with your dog, it's so much easier to teach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=238.6s	238.6	 new things to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=239.8s	239.8	 In order to achieve a strong bond, you have to spend so much one on one time with your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=244.9s	244.9	 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=245.9s	245.9	 And that makes it more practical for one or two people to focus on training and building
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 that bond in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=251.3s	251.3	 If you do elect to have more than one primary trainer, be sure to detail what the rules
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=255.6s	255.6	 are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 Some trainers in the house might be okay with the dog getting on the furniture and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=259.6s	259.6	 the other may not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=260.6s	260.6	 So workout issues like this ahead of time, agree to back one another up and speak as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=264.8s	264.8	 one voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 It's not that a dog will only listen to one person forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=268.8s	268.8	 It's just best for a dog to have consistent feedback from a really proficient teacher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=273.3s	273.3	 who is focused on training them in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=275.9s	275.9	 In my experience, one person in the household is likely to be more interested in training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=279.7s	279.7	 the dog and that's totally fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67-FnGxWfg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=401&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 But other members of the family really need to avoid undermining the main trainer or trainers.
