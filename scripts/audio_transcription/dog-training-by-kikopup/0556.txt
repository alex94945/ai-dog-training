https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Now the dogs are walking, yeah the dogs are walking, yeah the dogs are walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 Today we're talking with Jessica Weecraft who's an expert on pit bulls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=20.1s	20.1	 She's a professional dog trainer and she's also a trainer for Pit Bull Rescue San Diego.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 Thanks for having me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=26.4s	26.4	 You're welcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=27.4s	27.4	 So firstly I wanted to ask you how did you get involved with pit bulls?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 Five years ago when I wanted to adopt a dog of my own I was looking for a Labrador Retriever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=36.7s	36.7	 or some sort of mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=38.1s	38.1	 And so I accidentally fell into the pit bull thing by going to look at a dog that I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=43.3s	43.3	 interested in adopting who was a Lab Mastiff mix according to the rescue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=48.1s	48.1	 So I go up there and I walk in the door and I look at this dog and I was like oh she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 a little smaller than a Mastiff Lab mix but I was like well I really liked her, she had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 a great personality and so I took her home and then I found out that she was a pit bull.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 So you started researching about pit bulls?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 Yeah so I started doing research on the breed, really discovered a lot of the prejudice and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=70.6s	70.6	 stuff that these dogs face and I think the experience of having my own dog, all the things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=76.1s	76.1	 I had read and heard about pit bulls as far as being aggressive, all the typical myths
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=81.3s	81.3	 and stuff that you hear didn't add up with my own dog and so I started realizing I think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=86.3s	86.3	 this is wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=87.3s	87.3	 And so then I started getting involved with people that were supporting pit bulls, things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=91.7s	91.7	 like that and that's how I got involved with Pit Bull Rescue San Diego.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 So I started volunteering for them, I helped with adoption events, I started fostering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=98.8s	98.8	 pit bulls in my home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=99.8s	99.8	 From there I kind of just fell into it completely by accident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 I really have always just felt this drive to stand up for pit bulls and kind of just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=108.7s	108.7	 spell the myths that surround the breed and so I've done the volunteer work with Pit Bull Rescue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=113.7s	113.7	 and now I've started doing pit bull seminars to help educate people about the breed and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 to really get the facts and the truth out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 So yeah I think pit bulls are just one of the coolest, definitely one of the coolest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 breeds out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=126.6s	126.6	 Isn't that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 Yeah!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=128.6s	128.6	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 So what are some good training tips for specifically pit bulls?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 It's not all about exercise with these dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=139.6s	139.6	 They're so smart and they're very, very, very quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 So clicker training really complements that because you kind of get the best of both worlds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 Lots of mental stimulation and it's really easy to teach them new things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 Another thing that's important with all dogs but particularly pit bulls and terriers is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=157.4s	157.4	 teaching them how to relax themselves so they can calm down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=161.9s	161.9	 Terriers as a breed they go from 0 to 60 in 2 seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 So it's important to be able to teach them how to relax their bodies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 Something that I've done with Harley is I've taught her an exercise called Relax on a Mount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 where she learned to relax her body on her own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 One of the cues that I use when I tell her that I want her to relax is I take a deep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=179.7s	179.7	 breath and then she takes that cue from me and is like maybe I should relax right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 So go ahead and show you how it's done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=194.9s	194.9	 That was awesome timing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=207.9s	207.9	 So this is the easy button.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 We're going to ask Harley to do a couple of behaviors and then we're going to ask her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 what she thought of that, if that was easy or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=214.5s	214.5	 And of course it's easy for her because she's a pit bull and they're so darn smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 So let's go ahead and see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=220.6s	220.6	 Spin right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=222.6s	222.6	 Spin left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=223.6s	223.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=225.2s	225.2	 Spin right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=227.2s	227.2	 Bang.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 Oh, sweet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=229.2s	229.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=230.2s	230.2	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=231.2s	231.2	 It worked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=232.2s	232.2	 Roll over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=233.2s	233.2	 Hey Harley, how was that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=234.2s	234.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=235.2s	235.2	 Take a bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=236.2s	236.2	 So now we're going to ask her to do a couple of behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=247.8s	247.8	 So this is one of me and Harley's favorite tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=261.5s	261.5	 I taught her this one kind of as a joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 A lot of people don't feel safe around pit bulls so I taught Harley how to spread them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 so I can pat her down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=270.4s	270.4	 Make sure she doesn't have any locking jaws or anything on her so go ahead and demo it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=274.7s	274.7	 right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=275.7s	275.7	 Spread them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=277.2s	277.2	 She's not clear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=287.2s	287.2	 Another common misperception about pit bulls is that they're responsible for the majority
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=290.8s	290.8	 of the attacks on people as well as the majority of the fatalities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=295.3s	295.3	 A big reason why people have that impression about pit bulls is because they hear about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=300.2s	300.2	 it so much in the media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=302.5s	302.5	 The media, however, is not a reputable source about information and particularly about dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=307.3s	307.3	 attacks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=308.3s	308.3	 One organization that I really, really like is called the National Canine Research Council.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=313.4s	313.4	 The National Canine Research Council was founded by Karen DeLis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=317.1s	317.1	 Karen has investigated every single fatality in the United States for which information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=322.8s	322.8	 was available.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=324.6s	324.6	 She has found that pit bulls are actually not responsible for the majority of attacks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=328.8s	328.8	 on people and that there's several different factors that fall into a dog attack and not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=334.4s	334.4	 so much of the breed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=335.4s	335.4	 That's a point that I think is very important to make in order to help people understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=340.6s	340.6	 why do dogs attack in the first place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 It doesn't have anything to do with the breed of dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=346.4s	346.4	 The studies that Karen has done has shown that in 90% of dog attacks that resulted in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=351.2s	351.2	 a fatality, there was three factors involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=355.1s	355.1	 One of them, what was the purpose or the function of the dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=358.3s	358.3	 Was it used as a guard dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=360.1s	360.1	 Was it used for breeding?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=361.1s	361.1	 Or was it used for some sort of negative function?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=364.4s	364.4	 The other one was, was the dog spayed or neutered?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=366.8s	366.8	 That was another big factor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVH9ztmx1U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=557&pp=iAQB&t=367.8s	367.8	 And the third one, which is one of the most important components, is was the dog a resident
