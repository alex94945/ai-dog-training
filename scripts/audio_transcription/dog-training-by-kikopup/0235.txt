https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 But in this video, I'm going to show you me training my 18 week old puppy Halo here, the same behavior using the same steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=14.2s	14.2	 Are you ready, pup-pups? So we first worked on rear end awareness and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 turning to the left and right and I'm starting to add a verbal cue to the left and the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=23.9s	23.9	 So this direction is turn, good job. And the other direction, which he's not as good at, is called flip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 Good. So we need to work on that more so that he builds muscles equally on both sides. Good job, Pupsy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 Awesome. We also worked on the behavior of back through, where I move my hand from one side of the leg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 to the other side and he follows the hand past my leg and picks it up on the other side while backing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=51.3s	51.3	 up. So he's learned the behavior of back through. Good job. Oh, you're so clever. Yes, you got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=59.6s	59.6	 Okay, then we added the two behaviors together. Are you ready? Turn, good. Back through. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=68.7s	68.7	 Flip. Good. Back through. Good. Turn. Turn. Good. Here we go. Turn. Back through. Good. Flip. Back through. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 Good. Good boy. And go between and dip. Good. Here we go. Ready, pretty boy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45lk4_tud9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=236&pp=iAQB&t=97.8s	97.8	 Ready? Good boy. Turn. Back through. Flip. Back through. Go between and dip. Can you dip? Good. Ready? Dip. Good. Dip. Good.
