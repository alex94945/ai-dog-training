https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, this video is on proofing the recall. Now once you've gone through the basics of proofing a recall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=7.6s	7.6	 most people will work on teaching their dog to come even though there's the distraction of food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=13.9s	13.9	 toys, other dogs and people and for some of those dogs those might be the most extreme distractions for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 However, a lot of times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=24.1s	24.1	 people will think that if they worked on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 multiple things or the games that they've been taught by trainers then their dog should have a reliable recall because they worked so hard on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 But it's really important to understand your dog and what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=38.2s	38.2	 certain things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=39.5s	39.5	 really arouse them, make them very excited and also what things scare your dog a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=45.5s	45.5	 So those two things factor into why a dog might not come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=50.4s	50.4	 Other reasons a dog might not come back could do with the level of stress they're under or illness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 So those you need to take into account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 But it's really important to know what excites your dog and what scares your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 because those are going to be the times when your dog probably won't come back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=70.7s	70.7	 So if you have this really reliable dog and they're terrified of fireworks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 if your dog is off leash and there's fireworks or maybe it's a car backfiring and your dog runs away from you when they're scared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=83.7s	83.7	 then that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=85.6s	85.6	 your dog is not going to have a reliable recall and they will run away most likely if there is a loud noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=93.3s	93.3	 Instead of trying to proof the recall with loud noises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 the solution is to take away or reduce the dog's fear,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=103.6s	103.6	 reduce the dog's fears of what they're scared of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 So that is the first step to then working on the recall and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 conversely if something makes your dog over excited instead of just trying to proof the recall with a really exciting thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=119.8s	119.8	 you can actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 inadvertently ruin your recall if the dog really wants whatever that is unless you're using the pre-MAC principle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 whereby coming back to you the dog then gets access to whatever it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=132.9s	132.9	 But one great way besides playing games like the pre-MAC principle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=137.3s	137.3	 but one great way is reducing the dog's arousal around the things that make them really excited. So if they are excited by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=146.1s	146.1	 prey in the environment, animals moving around, if they're excited by cars,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 skateboards, the first step would be can they relax on a mat when something very minimal happens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 So you break the steps of training up into small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=162.9s	162.9	 successful approximations that are easy for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=165.5s	165.5	 For example, the dog could settle on a mat while you just have a skateboard near them and then move it two inches and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=172.1s	172.1	 progress to where your dog can just relax while you skateboard around and then progress to where someone else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=178.3s	178.3	 skateboards around while they relax and then if you can get a dog to relax around a skateboard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=182.2s	182.2	 they're gonna come to you easily when you call them because you've worked on that arousal for whatever it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=188.1s	188.1	 So a lot of people think oh, I really need to work on my recall. But in fact, it's more about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 reinforcing your dog for being calm and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 relaxed when different things happen in the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=201.1s	201.1	 So one way to do that is simply taking your dog out and about in public if your dog's excited about a park and you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=208.1s	208.1	 work on settle on a mat. That's gonna greatly improve your dog's recall if you can get a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=213.3s	213.3	 that's calm at the park where if you were going there before and your dog was so excited when they get to the park
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 they're not gonna come back to you because there's all this stuff they want to do. For certain situations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 being at a distance from whatever it is makes a recall easier for a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 So one thing you can do is utilize a leash and a harness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 attached to your dog or a fence that the dog can see through and then have the distraction at a distance behind the fence or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=241.4s	241.4	 have the distraction at a distance from your dog on leash and what you're going to do is simply ask your dog to look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=248.5s	248.5	 you or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=250.1s	250.1	 turn to you or even come to you on the leash and harness when the distraction is at a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 So one way of doing that is seeing if the dog might offer and if the dog doesn't you can create more distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=262.6s	262.6	 from the distraction or you can use a treat on your dog's nose to lure them away to create more distance and see if your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 dog is able to look at you when you ask for their attention or come to you when you back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 Another thing you can do if you have an extreme case where something's way in the distance and your dog is still excited is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=281.6s	281.6	 you can go behind a barrier. So perhaps a parked car,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=284.4s	284.4	 your dog is fixated on someone holding a ball in the distance because they think they're gonna throw it and the dog is very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 sensitized and excited by thinking they're gonna herd or chase the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=295.5s	295.5	 So the person's standing neutrally with the ball, the dog can't look away even though the person's as far away as possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=301.5s	301.5	 so you could get your dog behind the car, ask your dog to look at you or come to you from behind the car and then they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=308.1s	308.1	 can go out and look at the person at a distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=311.1s	311.1	 from a distance. So you're giving them access to looking at the person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=315.6s	315.6	 for coming back to you and then that would be one way of starting to proof the recall with a distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=322.6s	322.6	 Another thing you can do is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=324.8s	324.8	 have the person standing with the ball
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=327.4s	327.4	 in the field and your dog is close by. This might actually be easier for your dog than adding distance depending on your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 Some dogs are actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=337.7s	337.7	 easier to work with when they're really close to whatever it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=341.1s	341.1	 Say for example meeting a dog they can be called away and then return to meeting a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=345.6s	345.6	 but if they see a dog far in the distance, it's extremely exciting for them based on the learning and genetics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=355.3s	355.3	 Like for example some border collies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=357.7s	357.7	 small things moving in the distance can make them herdy, but when it's right up in their face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=362.6s	362.6	 they're not excited or the opposite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 So the same scenario a person holding a ball you could have the dog as long as the dog is unaggressive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 or you don't think the dog is going to hurt the person, you know, they're just going to most likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=378.5s	378.5	 sniff the ball or find it uninteresting because it's not being thrown. The person standing with the ball
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=383.6s	383.6	 you let your dog go over and see that the person is not moving and not going to throw the ball when the dog is near
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=389.4s	389.4	 them and then just wait and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=391.8s	391.8	 at some point you might be able to recall your dog away from that person. You can also use toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=398.7s	398.7	 in order to get this behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=401.1s	401.1	 So you might have a similar ball to the person and when your dog comes back to you, you throw that ball
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=406.5s	406.5	 and then you release your dog back to seeing that person who's just standing there holding a ball. Now it might take some time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=413.9s	413.9	 for this training to work, but if you're working on something specific and the dog is stuck and they just can't seem to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=421.7s	421.7	 I would say after three or five repetitions at the same level of criteria, if the dog can't look back at you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=428.5s	428.5	 it's too hard and you have to figure out a way to change the picture or you're going to get stuck with that picture of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhEv11b-gI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=122&pp=iAQB&t=435.0s	435.0	 the dog feeling conflicted about the recall. You really want to build it in small approximations where the dog is like
