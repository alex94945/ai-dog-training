https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody! This video is on the topic of teaching your dog to be comfortable with grooming, handling and nail trimming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=7.9s	7.9	 Now most likely you're watching this video because you've already noticed that your dog has a dislike or perhaps even a fear of being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=16.1s	16.1	 groomed, handled or having his nails trimmed. Don't beat yourself up too much as this is a very common problem with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=23.7s	23.7	 In this video I'm going to give you some tips for changing your dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=27.5s	27.5	 emotional response to being handled and groomed. The first tip is called changing the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 Now if your dog is already having a negative emotional response to being groomed or handled,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 it's really hard to kind of undo the experiences of the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=43.9s	43.9	 It's much easier to build a new picture, a new grooming or handling or nail trimming routine from scratch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 than trying to undo negative emotions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 So what I like to do is begin in such a small way that the dog doesn't even know that the training and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 conditioning is about the same behavior of being groomed, handled or having his nails trimmed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 One way you can do this is also switch the way that you groom your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=71.5s	71.5	 So for example, if you were trimming your dog's nails while he's standing up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=76.7s	76.7	 maybe the way that you're going to be gradually training him to enjoy nail trimming is that he lays on his back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 and has his nails dremeled instead of being clipped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 Here's some footage of training a young puppy to enjoy the sound of the dremel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Check out the description for a link to the video on how to train this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=97.8s	97.8	 Another thing that you can do is change the environment that the grooming or handling is going to happen in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=104.4s	104.4	 So maybe you always groom your dog in the living room,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 but now you're going to begin the training outside in a way that the dog doesn't even know that you're going to start training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=115.3s	115.3	 behaviors that are related to grooming or handling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=118.3s	118.3	 It's also a good idea to change the antecedents to grooming or handling, or in other words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=124.1s	124.1	 change the picture of what predicts that you're going to groom or handle your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=129.1s	129.1	 So most likely you keep your nail clippers or the brush in a drawer, you go to that drawer, you take it out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 and the dog is already possibly leaving the room and saying, no, no, no, not that, not that, please not that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=143.6s	143.6	 So if you try to start there and you get out your treats and you're going to try and change the picture,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 the dog is already remembering the past experiences and might not even be interested in treats at that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 So you can move the location of the tools that you're going to be using,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=160.1s	160.1	 maybe you keep them in the cupboard where you keep the dog treats and you keep them in a crinkly packet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=166.5s	166.5	 that sounds like the chip packet that you might feed your dog snacks from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=170.3s	170.3	 So by changing the picture like that, the dog isn't going to have that negative response of running away from you first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=178.2s	178.2	 and then you can bring the tools outside in the crinkly packet and begin training outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 Tip number two, set your training up for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 Train and groom your dog when he's the most comfortable and receptive to the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=192.5s	192.5	 Now it depends on your dog when this might be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 Some dogs will do best when they've just had a walk and they're relaxing where other dogs won't want to be messed with after their walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=203.3s	203.3	 So you need to find out more about your dog as to when is the best time to groom and when are times to avoid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=210.2s	210.2	 I find very frequently when a dog is very warm, they have less pain and sensitivity when being groomed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 For example, here you can see a video of my little terrier Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 He can be very sensitive to having his feet touched if he's cold but if he's nice and warm from the sun,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=228.8s	228.8	 he finds it really easy to be handled and groomed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=232.5s	232.5	 So with him I always avoid grooming and training him when it's super cold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=238.7s	238.7	 and I'll either have him lay in the sun and then groom his nails 20 minutes later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=244.4s	244.4	 or I use a heated dog bed or blankets and make sure he's warm before I do any grooming or nail trimming with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=252.3s	252.3	 So that might be a great tip for your dog or perhaps that will have no effect on your dog's behavior but it's worth a try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 Tip number three, break the steps up into small approximations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=265.1s	265.1	 The smaller you go, the easier it's going to be for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=268.8s	268.8	 So if the dog is doing really well, they will go through the steps fast and if your dog isn't doing so well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=275.4s	275.4	 you'll be able to pick out what exactly is the dog having an issue with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=280.6s	280.6	 So instead of just reaching and trying to clip your dog's nail and seeing that the dog withdraws and finds it aversive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 if you break the steps up small enough and you're just reaching and touching the paw and your dog has an issue with just that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=294.8s	294.8	 you can work on that separately before then adding all the things together that your dog might just be too much for your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=302.5s	302.5	 to find it a positive experience or even want to work for food in order for you to do all that lump together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=309.4s	309.4	 Tip number four, train more frequently in short fun sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=313.9s	313.9	 Now most of us are only human and we see our dog starting to have an issue so we start to work on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 but then we forget about it and then time passes and then we realize that we need to work on it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=326.1s	326.1	 So I suggest creating a chart or creating a daily habit where you work on the behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=333.4s	333.4	 to teach your dog to be comfortable with grooming and nail trimming every day rather than try to do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=339.3s	339.3	 every few days or once a week because it might just not add up enough to where your dog is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=345.7s	345.7	 change and start having a positive emotional response to it. So I really suggest that you put in the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=351.5s	351.5	 right now if your dog is having an issue and work on the issue every day until you start to see your dog change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=359.3s	359.3	 Otherwise the issue can just go on and on and your dog can always have an aversion to being groomed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=365.2s	365.2	 or having his nails done. So one thing you can do is use some of his breakfast and dinner to work on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=371.3s	371.3	 handling and grooming exercises daily until you get to the point where you're seeing your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=378.3s	378.3	 change his emotions and start to feel comfortable with it. Otherwise if there's time between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=385.6s	385.6	 training something that can happen is the dog can regress to disliking the grooming and not enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=392.4s	392.4	 conditioning has been done in between training to move on to the next step. So you're always kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=398.4s	398.4	 rehearsing the first step every time you get to a training session where if you do more frequent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=403.7s	403.7	 training sessions it's easier to raise criteria in my opinion. When I had just got into training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=410.2s	410.2	 around 16 years ago I was assisting another trainer Kate Pellese and she taught me a mind-blowing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=416.7s	416.7	 concept that you don't have to do all the dog's nails in the same training session and I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=425.2s	425.2	 being a human I naturally when I cut my own nails I want to do all of them it just feels wrong to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=431.0s	431.0	 do one nail but when I was working with my own puppy and my clients dogs just doing a tiny bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=438.0s	438.0	 of one nail at a time can really turn it into a short fun and positive experience rather than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=445.4s	445.4	 going I'm just going to do one more just one more and then the dog is starting to find that it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 so fun anymore so short frequent fun experiences and you don't have to do all your dog's nails at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=458.0s	458.0	 the same time and you don't have to get all your dog's mats in their coat at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhfOk05nM_4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=205&pp=iAQB&t=463.8s	463.8	 Short and fun is really an extremely important concept when it comes to grooming and teaching
