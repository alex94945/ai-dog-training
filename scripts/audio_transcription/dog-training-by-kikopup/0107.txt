https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, this is Tyrion the Border Terrier and we're going to demo an exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 that's great for teaching your dog to walk next to you and also what to do when they get out ahead of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=11.3s	11.3	 So normally most dogs if they've walked out ahead of you for some reason or maybe you've backed away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=17.8s	17.8	 they don't know how to get back into the position. So for my own service dog training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=23.7s	23.7	 I like to teach dogs how to find the position next to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 when they've gone out ahead. So when they're out ahead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=31.5s	31.5	 it's a cue, a default situational cue to mean oh I need to get back into the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 that you want your dog in. So for me, I'm going to have it on my left side next to me and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 first we're going to warm up with just an exercise of getting the dog to move with me and stop with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 So I'm marking and feeding him for standing at my side when I've stopped and also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 mark him for moving with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=60.7s	60.7	 I already have a video tutorial on how to train the part of the exercise where the dog stops when you stop and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=66.9s	66.9	 moves when you move. So if you need more detail on that you can check out the video in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 starring Halo as a little pup. To begin with you can use a treat lure and lure the dog far enough behind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 mark and reinforce when the dog is back at your side like that. Now if your dog is not thinking to turn around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 free, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 mark and reinforce for them going way back here, feed there, and then another treat for turning around it first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=95.1s	95.1	 And then once you've done that a couple of times and marked and reinforced for the dog standing stationary at your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=101.6s	101.6	 free, you can then see if you can do it without a treat and just invite your dog with an open hand like that. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=110.9s	110.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=111.9s	111.9	 Once your dog is reliably following the visual cue you can add a verbal cue such as close or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=118.6s	118.6	 word or cue you want to have mean for the dog to be in the default position. Free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=124.6s	124.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=125.4s	125.4	 So I'm going to say close and then lure the dog with my hand signal into the position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=130.9s	130.9	 mark and feed. Then you can get the dog to offer this behavior if you like, but in this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=136.7s	136.7	 I'm just going to go over proofing getting back into that position. Free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=141.1s	141.1	 So one way of getting back in the position is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=144.3s	144.3	 turning around and straightening yourself up like a finish. The other way to get back in that position is backing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=151.1s	151.1	 So to teach that you lure the dog a little bit forward or you cue them to touch your hand like that or just say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=157.7s	157.7	 get it to get the treat and then you're gonna lure the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 backwards to get back into that position. Now some dogs will lay down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 if you lure them backwards, so you have to have the treat low enough at first and it's not gonna look that pretty good, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 you'll get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 So putting the treat down below their chin and moving it back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=181.3s	181.3	 marking the millisecond the dog moves back and I've lost my clicker. To initially get the back up behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=187.1s	187.1	 you can drop a treat down between your legs like this and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=190.2s	190.2	 mark just a stutter step backwards and feed between the dog's feet a little bit further back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=196.5s	196.5	 So they're moving back looking for a treat. So he can't go around my legs because there's a wall in the background.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=202.4s	202.4	 So I'm gonna put the treat there, stand up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=205.1s	205.1	 drop some treats on him and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=207.6s	207.6	 mark the moment he gets up to move back to see where I went and look for more treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=213.5s	213.5	 So the dog really has to be motivated to find treats. If the dog sits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=218.1s	218.1	 you can just lure the dog back up and then move the treat below them to get them to stand up like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=224.5s	224.5	 Another thing you can do is just sit in a chair like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=228.9s	228.9	 with a space between, put the treat there and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 then lure the dog back and see if the dog might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=238.3s	238.3	 walk backwards, but because he's thinking to do obedience behaviors, I'm just gonna make the channel a little smaller and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=246.5s	246.5	 then mark a stutter step back like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=249.4s	249.4	 So just setting up the props and the environment can help the dog figure out the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 So because the channel is a little bit too uncomfortable to turn around and easier to back up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 he's gonna choose to back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=270.5s	270.5	 Good boy, yeah! Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 Back up! Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 Get it! Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=288.8s	288.8	 Back up!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=290.7s	290.7	 Good! If you're uncomfortable putting food down on the ground,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=294.1s	294.1	 you can simply feed a treat here and then quickly move your hand away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=298.1s	298.1	 so that the dog has to back up to get it. If you've worked on sit a lot or down a lot,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=304.1s	304.1	 seeing your hand with the treat is like the cue to do the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=308.0s	308.0	 So that is why some dogs struggle when you try to lure them backwards with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=312.3s	312.3	 So first getting this little bit of offering is really going to help them get the movement of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=317.7s	317.7	 backing up when you move your hand away. So now I don't have a treat there and I'm just gonna move my hand back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 in a gesture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 and mark and reinforce for backing up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=329.9s	329.9	 lure him a little bit forward if he thinks to sit so that I'm reinforcing him in the standing position. Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=337.1s	337.1	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=339.3s	339.3	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=342.7s	342.7	 Back up! Good! Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=347.7s	347.7	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=349.2s	349.2	 Good job! Ready? Back up!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=351.9s	351.9	 Awesome! Nice work!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=354.3s	354.3	 So he is backing up away from me and the behavior that we're gonna want is for him to back up to get next to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=361.4s	361.4	 again. So what I can do is turn my chair around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=365.9s	365.9	 Back up!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=368.3s	368.3	 Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=370.7s	370.7	 Back up!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=372.6s	372.6	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=375.1s	375.1	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=376.7s	376.7	 Back up!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=378.2s	378.2	 Good boy! Touch! Back up!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=382.1s	382.1	 Back up! Good! That was good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=387.7s	387.7	 Get it! Back up!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=391.2s	391.2	 Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=393.4s	393.4	 The next step is seeing if your dog will offer the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=396.6s	396.6	 So I'm gonna feed him slightly ahead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 bring my hand back and see if he goes back into the default position at my side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=404.7s	404.7	 So if your dog doesn't think to back up, you can simply do a hand gesture to get them to back up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=411.3s	411.3	 your verbal cue close if that's what the cue is for having your dog at your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=416.3s	416.3	 or if that doesn't work you can lure the dog back into the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=421.1s	421.1	 So you can either use a hand target to get your dog out of the position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=425.5s	425.5	 move your hand back like you're standing normally or sitting normally or however
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=430.1s	430.1	 you want to be when your dog's next to your side and then you're gonna mark and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=434.6s	434.6	 reinforce your dog for being back at your side like that and then mark and reinforce your dog for staying there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=440.7s	440.7	 So the dog doesn't know when they're gonna get the treat for being at your side like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=445.2s	445.2	 He's like, what if I go even further back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=449.1s	449.1	 Okay, so I'm gonna lure him a little bit in front of me like this and see if he can think to get back

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=462.1s	462.1	 and I didn't want him to then have to do that maneuver to get back there like a finish,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=467.7s	467.7	 what I could do is create a corner to teach him that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=471.6s	471.6	 So either go into the corner of a room or lure the dog so that they're right in front of you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=477.3s	477.3	 and then they have to turn in order to get back at your side like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=481.3s	481.3	 So I can say get it and then I can stand up normally and see if he thinks to get into the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=488.7s	488.7	 He was a little skew so you can see how being in the corner of a room would really help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=493.4s	493.4	 So I'm gonna go in in that corner by the couch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=496.5s	496.5	 because this object isn't as helpful for training the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=501.9s	501.9	 So if I stand here, good job, and then I see if he offers turning into the heel position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=509.3s	509.3	 and that makes it much, it makes it much easier for him to understand because that visual barrier on his left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=517.7s	517.7	 is there and he can straighten up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=521.2s	521.2	 This is Epic Mai Chauwawa on a socialization trip to Home Depot when she was a puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=526.7s	526.7	 and you can see the exercise of teaching her to stop when you stop next to my side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=532.2s	532.2	 as well as get back into the heel position really has taught her where to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=537.1s	537.1	 when we move through the environment in different environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=540.5s	540.5	 Today's murder details.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=542.5s	542.5	 And sorry, thank you for shopping at the El Cajon Home Depot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=548.7s	548.7	 It's a great idea to master these exercises at home and in non-distracting environments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=554.1s	554.1	 to build that reinforcement value of wanting to be in that default position at your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=559.9s	559.9	 rather than trying to train these exercises out and about because what can happen is the reinforcement value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=566.3s	566.3	 can be lower to the dog because they're out and about and there are distractions happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=570.9s	570.9	 so really building the strength of your behaviors at home is going to make your dog want to do them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=576.6s	576.6	 when out and about if you've practiced enough and build that positive association with being next to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=582.7s	582.7	 And then the final step if you have a service dog team is going to the places you need to go with your service dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwZ7I_EvMDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=108&pp=iAQB&t=590.4s	590.4	 Thank you so much for watching. If you'd like to support my work, don't forget to like,
