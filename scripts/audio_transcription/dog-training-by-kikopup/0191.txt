https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone, this video is on the topic of teaching position changes with the back feet static.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 You can thank my Kikopop members for this video as they voted for it in one of their polls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 Now there are many different ways to train behaviors such as position changes, but I'm going to show you how I do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 Now the first step is obviously working on a down, a sit and a stand with duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 So you're reinforcing the dog for staying in those positions without moving their feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 That's going to be very helpful when then training the dog to get from one position into the other without shuffling their feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=36.3s	36.3	 So another thing that you want to keep in mind is the dog's body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=40.6s	40.6	 See how he's kind of flipped his hips over and he's in a nice calm settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=45.4s	45.4	 You want to make sure that your dog's body is symmetrical on both sides when doing this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 And that's one of the reasons why I like to hold treats in both of my hands to lure the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 So I'm not even going to worry about marking like with a clicker or saying yes or good yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 I'm just going to practice my luring skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=66.7s	66.7	 So I have treats in both of my hands and I'm going to lure him into the sit position and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=71.8s	71.8	 then I'm going to move the treat a little bit like that so that his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=75.9s	75.9	 his two back legs are lined up nice and straight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 Then I'm going to move both of my hands down into the down position and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 Basically what I'm doing is that whichever hand he's looking at I'm going to feed him from the other hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 so that he's going to line up straighter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=92.5s	92.5	 So the eventual thing is that I'm going to want him to just face straightforward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 and then the treats are going to come from either side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=99.9s	99.9	 So another exercise you can practice before doing this game is that eye contact exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=106.5s	106.5	 that most dog trainers know about where you ask for eye contact with the distraction of holding treats in both of your hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 Good, but don't worry if your dog is focusing on one of your hands during this luring exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=120.4s	120.4	 because what is going to happen is you're just going to feed with the opposite hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=124.3s	124.3	 so that it will line your dog straight up again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=126.7s	126.7	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=127.7s	127.7	 So I'm going to ask him to sit and I'm going to move both of my hands up like this and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 then feed from the opposite hand that he's focused on. If he's focused straight ahead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=136.5s	136.5	 I'm going to feed him straight ahead like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 So going from the down into the stand you move the treats up at a diagonal like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=148.7s	148.7	 and then to get the dog back into the position you move the treats into the dog like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=154.3s	154.3	 Another way you can do it is use a high rate of reinforcement for having the dog lay down like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=159.7s	159.7	 and then if they have a cue like get it you can simply hold a treat get it in the place where their head is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 when they're standing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 So most people would think their head would be here, but their head is actually going to be here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=173.2s	173.2	 So I'm going to put a treat in my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=177.1s	177.1	 and then he's ready to do it and then say get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 Good and I can jiggle my hand or show him the treat that it's for him to get him to stand up nicely like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=190.4s	190.4	 Another thing if your dog is comfortable with you touching their feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 it can be helpful to get them to start out in the right position to be standing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=200.1s	200.1	 If your dog's legs are far forwards like this it's going to be really hard for them to shuffle back into the sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=210.1s	210.1	 So if you want a nice clean bounce into the sit like that if your dog's overextended his arms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=216.4s	216.4	 he's going to have to struggle to get up into the sit and also struggle to get up into the standing position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 I'm going to be mean and make you have to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=227.8s	227.8	 So if he stands up you can see his legs are all spread apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=231.2s	231.2	 So starting out in a nice sit or a nice down position you might help your dog out by moving their legs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=238.8s	238.8	 and you can reinforce your dog with a treat or don't move your dog's legs yet if he's uncomfortable with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=245.3s	245.3	 So there he's nice and lined up straight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=248.7s	248.7	 If he flipped his hips I could just feed him a treat like this to line him up again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=253.8s	253.8	 and I'm going to work on him going from the down into the stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=256.9s	256.9	 Get it? Awesome. Now I'm going to work on him going from the stand into the sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 So I'm going to hold two treats and move them back like that back and up at a diagonal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 and then to have him come forwards back into the stand I'm going to move them forwards in a diagonal downwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=274.4s	274.4	 So here's one of those pop awesome sit pop good sit pop awesome sit pop awesome down up sit pop good sit pop good sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=304.4s	304.4	 during this training you want to be extremely unpredictable about when you reinforce if you ask your dog to down then feed then stand then feed then sit then feed then come forwards into the stand position and feed and every position change you give a treat what can happen is that when you stop giving the treats the dog can get confused and feel like they got something wrong or they can start to offer the next behavior so if your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=334.4s	334.4	 misses the treat in the stand they might offer sitting or downing to see if that will get the treat faster so what you need to do is not only ask for the position changes without giving any treats in between like this but also down mark and reinforce your dog for staying in the positions for long durations with a higher level of reinforcement during these position changes so now he's in the down and he's staying in the down even though i haven't set it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=365.3s	365.3	 halo up awesome and now i'm going to feed him for standing and he's thinking to sit because we did a whole bunch of position changes and that's fine so when you start to see a problem like the dog staying in the position and not moving you need to focus on the position changes part of this behavior but if you see that if you're if you ask your dog to stand halo up and then your dog starts to change positions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=392.0s	392.0	 from the standing position because he thinks he's supposed to then what you need to go back and work on is the duration of just staying in one position so if you notice that specifically every time you ask your dog to stand they suddenly lay down within a second then every time you get to the standing position i would work on it a lot with duration like this and then go back to the different position changes down poor guy i'm not saying his verbal cues are bad but i'm just saying that he's going to be in the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=422.0s	422.0	 so he's not sure if he's supposed to bow or whatever pop awesome down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=431.4s	431.4	 up down sit pop good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=439.7s	439.7	 down good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=444.8s	444.8	 up good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=446.0s	446.0	 good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=449.0s	449.0	 a lot of trainers utilize props to train precise position changes the prop that i have here is simply a six dollar little tray to put your shoes on that i got from ikea and then i stuck some non-slip surface on the tray and then i've also put something underneath so that it sticks to the carpet and doesn't slip around but to get that precise position change from a sit to a stand where the front feet are moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=476.0s	476.0	 symmetrically i'm going to have her sit so that her front feet are just on the tray like this and then i'm going to ask her to get it so that she pops forwards to get the treat like this and then i'm going to ask her to sit again so that her front feet both go onto the tray and she's already practiced this so at first it won't be so smooth looking you're going to have to really build that concept and mark and reinforce for the both of the front feet going back onto the tray like that are you ready wish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=506.0s	506.0	 pop get it good sit good pop awesome sit good pop good job sit pop awesome sit pop good i suggest working on the position changes with accuracy in calm slow movements using food and then when the dog has understanding of getting into the different positions you can build speed and enthusiasm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=536.2s	536.2	 using toys sit sit get it good 12
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=550.0s	550.0	 i wanted to give you some tips for training position changes at a distance i think it's really important to teach the dog the concept of staying further away from you first before adding something precise like keep your feet in exactly the same position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=565.2s	565.2	 and move your body around while staying out now a lot of times people will leave their dog they ask their dog to sit and then they move away from the dog and then ask the dog to do position changes i suggest teaching your dog to go out away from you first so teach your dog to go out to a mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=583.1s	583.1	 or teach your dog to back up away from you and then my favorite exercises to work on first is teaching the dog to back away and spin in a circle left and right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=593.8s	593.8	 and once you can get to the point where your dog can spin and not move forwards towards you then you can start thinking about asking your dog for something precise like moving from a down to a stand without taking a step forwards towards you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=607.4s	607.4	 are you ready wishy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=611.4s	611.4	 here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=617.4s	617.4	 good girl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=619.4s	619.4	 drop back up twirl back spin back twirl back spin get it back up twirl see how she stayed in the same position now i'm pretty sure that she's going to be able to change positions without inching forwards are you ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=644.3s	644.3	 where's sit good ready and she's anticipating the reward going behind her so as soon as i was ready to throw it she was backing away from me rather than running forward towards me another tip is holding the food or the toy in a way that looks like you're going to throw it behind the dog as well as using exaggerated movements at first to set your dog up for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=667.4s	667.4	 to most dogs doing the same behaviors they know in front of you at a distance from you it's almost to them like they're learning a new behavior so i suggest using a high rate of reinforcement and marking less precise behavior and then going back and building in precision when the dog is in front of you again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=691.0s	691.0	 most trainers like to use food first to initially train a behavior and then add toys to get speed and enthusiasm i suggest working on the soft surface if you're going to have your dog change positions fast so that they don't hurt themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKG89GVOJiM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=192&pp=iAQB&t=708.7s	708.7	 i hope you found this video helpful for your training if you'd like to support my work don't forget to like comment and subscribe to my channel see you later guys
