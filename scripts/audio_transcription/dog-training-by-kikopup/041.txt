https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4uw3CJFSXs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 One of the reasons I don't use any no reward markers when training, especially when training drop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4uw3CJFSXs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=5.1s	5.1	 is I want the cues to be secondary reinforcers. So if I'm training a behavior using toys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4uw3CJFSXs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=11.5s	11.5	 I'm going to tell the dog to get it and I'm also going to tell the dog to drop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4uw3CJFSXs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 So I want those things to be secondary reinforcers to the dog so they enjoy letting go of the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4uw3CJFSXs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=21.6s	21.6	 in order to do more training and it's going to reinforce the whole chain of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4uw3CJFSXs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=25.8s	25.8	 So when I ask Halo to do heel work and I ask him to do tight and I say get it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4uw3CJFSXs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=30.9s	30.9	 then when I say drop then he's ready to go again. Get it! And he's really enjoying that drop cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4uw3CJFSXs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=42&pp=iAQB&t=37.4s	37.4	 and you can see that drop is just an opportunity to then get to get the toy again.
