https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody! This video is for those of you who are struggling to teach your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=4.7s	4.7	 the concept of staying in position when training something like sit-stay, down-stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=10.4s	10.4	 or stand-stay. Now what you might be experiencing is that you ask your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 to go into the position like a down and then if you just stand there saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 nothing the dog stands up and looks confused and sits and spins in a circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=25.9s	25.9	 or just comes towards you or just walks away looking confused or frustrated. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 what can be happening is that the dog is not understanding the concept of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=37.1s	37.1	 behavior being a maintained behavior where they have to wait for the release
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 cue. Now there are lots of games that you can play such as proofing the release
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=45.2s	45.2	 cue and I'll link a video on how to do that in the description but a fun game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=49.9s	49.9	 that my friend Kate Palese actually taught me a very long time ago and which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=55.2s	55.2	 I found very useful in training classes is this very simple trick. Basically how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=61.1s	61.1	 the game works is you ask your dog to get into the position like a down. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 suggest the down first because it's easier for dogs to stay in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=69.2s	69.2	 position than if you're working on the stand-stay where it's easy to take a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=73.5s	73.5	 couple steps forwards when they see a distraction in front of them. So you ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=77.7s	77.7	 your dog to get into the position and if your dog knows the leave it cue you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=81.8s	81.8	 say leave it as you put down a plate of food or a treat on the ground if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=86.6s	86.6	 don't mind just having the treat on the ground but if you have a problem with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 putting treats on the ground you can have a dog dish or a little target like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 this and you put the treat down on the ground and you mark and feed your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 for staying and then you can give your dog a release to eat the treat. So my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=102.5s	102.5	 release is get it and then I point towards where the treats are. So if your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=108.4s	108.4	 dog is reluctant to get up you can make kissy noises, pat on your leg and move the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 dish to offer the dog the food or use their release cue like free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=119.1s	119.1	 get it so that they're learning to get up to get the treat. Some dogs if they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=124.3s	124.3	 really well trained they'll be reluctant to get up with a new release cue. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 ready? So to begin this training as you put the dish down your dog might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=135.7s	135.7	 immediately get up to get the treats off the dish if your dog doesn't know the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=139.4s	139.4	 leave it cue. So to teach your dog this new concept you ask your dog to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=144.1s	144.1	 into the position and as you go to put the treats down like this you mark and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=148.5s	148.5	 reinforce your dog for staying in the position like that. Good job! So I'm just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=153.9s	153.9	 gonna put the dish down like that. Good and if he were to get up to go for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=159.9s	159.9	 treats I can pick the treats up lure him back into the position and then just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=164.4s	164.4	 simply work on moving the dish down to the ground while he stays in position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 Once your dog has had success with this game in the down position you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=172.1s	172.1	 practice in the sit and the stand position. Are you ready Halo? Sit! Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=177.7s	177.7	 He's sitting a little bit sloppy so I have moved the treat forward like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=182.1s	182.1	 so that he's sitting nice and straight. So the way you deliver the treat can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=186.1s	186.1	 actually straighten up their position which is good for their body to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 sitting in symmetry rather than flopped over on one side like that. Okay good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=197.8s	197.8	 Get it! Good job! Ready? Sit! Good! So he got up as I want to put the treat on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=212.7s	212.7	 plate so I just lured him back into the position and I'm moving my hand away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=217.9s	217.9	 from him like that to put the treat on the tray and I'm clicking as I move to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 put the treat down like that. Good job! Good boy! And the great thing about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=230.3s	230.3	 game is that if you have a dog that offers behavior you'll see that their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 focus is going to be on this tray with the treats and they're going to be very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=238.1s	238.1	 unlikely to start dancing around thinking that they're doing something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=242.6s	242.6	 wrong in order to keep to get the treats because their motivation is to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=247.7s	247.7	 released to the plate of food so they're waiting for you to give the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=251.4s	251.4	 release to get the treats. Ready? Get it! Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 Up! Good! Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=274.5s	274.5	 Get it! Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=278.5s	278.5	 Leave it! Up! Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=288.5s	288.5	 Leave it!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQWrzVOZBo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=196&pp=iAQB&t=305.5s	305.5	 without the little dish. Ready? Sit!
