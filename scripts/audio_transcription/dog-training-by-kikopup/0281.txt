https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, today's tip is for dogs who can become fearful or reactive towards strangers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 when out on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Now we don't often think about it, but the way we use our tone of voice when talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=10.9s	10.9	 to a friend that we like or a family member is very different than how we talk to a stranger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=16.5s	16.5	 and dogs can pick up on this cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=18.8s	18.8	 For example, when I see my brother I go, hey Daniel, how are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=23.2s	23.2	 Rather than good morning or hey, how's it going?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=27.2s	27.2	 What can happen is that the dogs can learn very quickly that when you say, hey, how's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=32.3s	32.3	 it going?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=33.3s	33.3	 It's somebody they don't know and it's not a friend and not a family member.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=37.2s	37.2	 So what can happen is the dog is not only reacting to the trigger of seeing the person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 coming towards you or walking past you, but they're also going to start reacting to when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=47.9s	47.9	 you say, hey, how's it going?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=49.9s	49.9	 Or good morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=51.7s	51.7	 So what you can do is condition a positive emotional response towards your greeting to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=56.7s	56.7	 strangers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=57.7s	57.7	 So I'll show you how I do it with my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=59.7s	59.7	 I say, good morning and then I give all of them a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=65.7s	65.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=67.7s	67.7	 Now, if your dog reacts when you say, good morning in your own house or when you're walking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 and there's nobody, I suggest starting easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 So you just say, good morning in a very soft tone of voice that doesn't elicit a fearful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 or reactive response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=83.9s	83.9	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=85.9s	85.9	 Good morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=91.9s	91.9	 Wish me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=93.9s	93.9	 Another thing is that if you have a dog that reacts or becomes fearful around people, it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 can start to make you feel really reactive and fearful around other people because you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=102.9s	102.9	 know your dog might react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=104.9s	104.9	 So by playing this game, it actually can help you as a person to have a positive emotional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=108.9s	108.9	 response when you do see a stranger because you'll know what to say and you'll feel good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=112.9s	112.9	 about saying it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=113.9s	113.9	 If you have a dog that needs distance to feel comfortable, you need to practice what you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 going to say to people if you can't create the distance yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 So perhaps you waved at them and turned the other way but now they're following you and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=126.9s	126.9	 your dog is getting more and more stressed by this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 If you suddenly shout, hey, excuse me, can you turn and go the other way or hey, we need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=133.9s	133.9	 some room, that might also scare your dog and the dog is going to start thinking that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=139.9s	139.9	 when you raise your voice, it means that means something scary is happening in the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=144.9s	144.9	 So I like to practice, hi there, can you please call your dog, we need some distance between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=149.9s	149.9	 our dogs or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 Another tip is turning what you say to the stranger into a cue for what you want your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=157.9s	157.9	 dogs to be doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 So for example, when I walk with all my dogs off leash and I see a dog that I'm kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 worried about charging towards us, the first thing that I'm going to be saying is, hey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=167.9s	167.9	 excuse me, can you please call your dog before the dog gets too close where it won't be able
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 to listen to his own owner and I don't have enough time to gather all my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=176.9s	176.9	 So when I say, excuse me, can you please call your dog in a loud voice, I want all my dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=181.9s	181.9	 to come running to me and pay attention to me and that way I can put them on leash or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=187.9s	187.9	 I can protect them from whatever dog is coming at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=190.9s	190.9	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=191.9s	191.9	 So it's very simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=193.9s	193.9	 All you do is say that, hey, can you please call your dog and then say, come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=202.9s	202.9	 And then you just start to phase out the cue, come, so your dogs are responding to the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=208.9s	208.9	 hey there, can you please call your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=210.9s	210.9	 And you can practice this on walks when no one's around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=213.9s	213.9	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=215.9s	215.9	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlwJRQlppY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=282&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 Excuse me, can you please call your dog?
