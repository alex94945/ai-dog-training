https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This video is on the protocol for raising criteria in training setups for emotional and behavioral modification.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 It's important to check out the complete protocol for emotional and behavioral modification in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 because there are many steps before you even get to training setups with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 For example, your dog might not take treats when out of the house, or your dog might be overexcited by treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=26.5s	26.5	 or your dog doesn't know the specific behaviors that are going to benefit the dog in these training setups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 So check that out first, and then move on to learning about how to raise criteria in training setups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 These are the seven steps of the protocol for emotional and behavioral modification.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=46.5s	46.5	 Step one, investigate health and stress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=49.5s	49.5	 Step two, create a prevention plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 Step three, condition reinforcers and markers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=56.5s	56.5	 Step four, train and proof behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Step five, teach the concept of a setup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 Step six, separating triggers in training setups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=67.5s	67.5	 Step seven, training during real life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=70.5s	70.5	 Step six of the protocol for emotional and behavioral modification,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 which is separating triggers in training setups, is comprised of three steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Step one, analyze what the dog is reacting to and plan all the different ways you can split the triggers apart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=87.5s	87.5	 to work on one aspect at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 Work on the easiest ones before the harder ones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 Step two, add them together systematically, one at a time, with the easiest ones first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=99.5s	99.5	 Step three, vary training for generalization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=103.5s	103.5	 What will be covered in this video is knowing when to increase criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 and add triggers together systematically, as well as when it's time to reduce criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 when it's too hard for the learner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 Why do training setups?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=118.5s	118.5	 Training when out and about on walks can work for some dogs, but for others it can be too unpredictable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=124.5s	124.5	 causing the dog to have setbacks and the training to not be as effective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=129.5s	129.5	 With setups, there is less room for errors, it's easier to measure progress,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=134.5s	134.5	 easier to pinpoint triggers that need work, and less stressful for the dog and handler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=142.5s	142.5	 Choose a location with as few distractions as possible to begin with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 When your dog has mastered setups in non-distracting environments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 you can practice in busier environments but reduce criteria and expectations when you begin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 Here is the three-step protocol that I'll go over step by step with examples.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 The reason that I created this protocol is for those struggling to know when to raise or lower criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 in training sessions and struggle to read their dog's body language,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 and with this protocol, the dog tells you in a very obvious way when to raise and lower criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Step one, look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 In this step, you're going to mark the dog for looking at the decoy and feed the dog for looking back at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 If this is the first time the dog's ever played this game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 you're going to mark the millisecond that the dog looks at the decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 You want to mark within two seconds of the dog seeing whatever it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 because if you wait too long, what can happen is the dog might get overexcited or react to whatever it is that they're looking at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 After marking, you're going to feed the dog for looking back at you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 either feeding the dog to the mouth or putting the treat down on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 You can also move further away from the decoy to put the food down on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 By getting your dog to look away from the decoy, it not only gives your dog a short break to calm down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 but it's also a way to re-present the trigger without having to leave and come back or have the trigger leave and come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 Sometimes when a dog is just watching something happen, it's almost as though they're watching an action movie and eating popcorn,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 and it's hard to tell if the popcorn or dog treats are creating a conditioned emotional response in the dog or are simply just a snack to the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 Step 2. Look and look back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 After repeating step one multiple times where you mark the dog for looking at the decoy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 now you're going to test the learning and see if the dog has made the connection between the trigger and the reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 So wait no longer than four seconds and see if your dog will think to look back at you for the reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=281.0s	281.0	 This is different from step one because instead of marking as the dog looks, we are waiting for the dog to look back at us to mark and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=293.0s	293.0	 I suggest feeding the dog while they're still looking back at you so they can enjoy their reinforcement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=301.0s	301.0	 and when they're done with the treat, the trigger is re-presented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 Step 3. No need to look at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=310.0s	310.0	 Repeat step one and two with the same setup that's extremely predictable to the dog until the dog doesn't need to look at the trigger at all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 and ignores the trigger, offering the handler attention or other behaviors in order to gain reinforcement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 such as heel work or sitting or downing or giving eye contact or that the dog settles and ignores the trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=336.0s	336.0	 or that the dog can explore the environment with the handler, say for example sniffing trees and walking on a loose leash to explore bushes and the smells in the grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 If you skip this step and you're not an expert at reading your dog's body language and behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=354.0s	354.0	 it's hard to know if the dog is ready for the added criteria and you might inadvertently teach your dog to have to look at whatever it is in the environment constantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=365.0s	365.0	 instead of learn to ignore it like wind in the trees where the dog doesn't need to get excited about it or worry about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=374.0s	374.0	 By getting to the point where the dog can ignore the trigger completely and doesn't have to keep looking over every few seconds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 that tells you that your dog is ready to move on to the next step of adding criteria systematically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 If the dog achieves step three, add criteria systematically and return to step one. If not, reduce criteria and return to step one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 What to do if things go wrong? Now we should plan to have no errors in our training session, but errors happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 So if the criteria is raised too quickly, use a cue that has been previously trained with positive reinforcement to interrupt the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=413.0s	413.0	 and then you can either end the session or reduce criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=417.0s	417.0	 Avoid the intentional use of punishment with this method as it can cause the dog to start to hide his warning signs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=424.0s	424.0	 which makes it hard to read the dog in order to raise and lower criteria and can inadvertently create a negative emotional response in association with the trigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=435.0s	435.0	 If at any point in the steps the dog cannot look back after the marker, cannot look down for a treat, suddenly becomes fixated or reacts to the trigger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 use the previously trained cue, let's go and move in the opposite direction until your dog is comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=452.0s	452.0	 Then lower criteria and begin at step one. If the dog stops taking food or looks overly stressed, end the session and create a new plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=463.0s	463.0	 In this training set up, you can see the dog isn't looking back after the marker and continues to look at the decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=469.0s	469.0	 This means the criteria is too hard for the dog. There are many ways to reduce criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=475.0s	475.0	 One could be to do the exercise somewhere else, but the other could be to reduce variation in the man's movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=481.0s	481.0	 If the training continued, what could happen is that the dog could feel comfortable at times, but then be on edge again if the man did something unexpected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=492.0s	492.0	 In this next set up, the decoy was told to repeat the same movements and even though he's doing a quite fast squat movement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=500.0s	500.0	 you can see by the dog's body language that the dog is way more relaxed and can easily look away from him when he's walking around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=508.0s	508.0	 and when he squats, the dog can quickly look away from him for the reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=514.0s	514.0	 Adding criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=517.0s	517.0	 Begin with slow, predictable movement or stationary positions. Increase movement and unpredictability as the learner succeeds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=526.0s	526.0	 Begin with the easiest decoys possible, such as people or dogs the dog already trusts and has a relationship with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=534.0s	534.0	 When raising or adding criteria in training setups for emotional and behavioral modification,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=540.0s	540.0	 it's exactly the same as adding criteria for a behavior when training, such as a down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=548.0s	548.0	 So for example, if you were training your dog to stay in the down position, there are many aspects that go into that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=555.0s	555.0	 such as how long the dog can stay in the position, how far away you can be from the dog in that position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=561.0s	561.0	 and can they stay in that position with lots of different variables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=566.0s	566.0	 So instead of trying to work on all of those things at the same time, you're going to make it easier for the dog by working on one criterion at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=576.0s	576.0	 So you're teaching your dog to stay in a down stay for duration when there's no distractions and you're close to your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=584.0s	584.0	 so it's easy for your dog. And then when you start working on distractions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=588.0s	588.0	 you're not also going to see if your dog can stay in the down stay as long as he can ever stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=595.0s	595.0	 So when adding criterions, you make sure to drastically reduce everything else. So if something gets harder, everything else gets easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=604.0s	604.0	 So if you're planning on walking away from your dog and working on your distance from the dog, you're not also going to have distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=613.0s	613.0	 Then when you worked on the different aspects, you add them all together systematically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=618.0s	618.0	 So you're not going to add distance, distraction and duration all at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=623.0s	623.0	 You might work on one and the other and then work on an average ratio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=628.0s	628.0	 So you're not constantly making things harder and harder for the dog by asking for two minutes, then three minutes, then four minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=636.0s	636.0	 So if you're planning on a down stay, you might work on the distractions while the dog is in the down stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=643.0s	643.0	 get more intense while the amount of time the dog stays in the down stay varies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=650.0s	650.0	 And then the distractions get less intense and then the dog is also not getting as long duration in the down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=658.0s	658.0	 So it doesn't just keep getting harder and harder for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=662.0s	662.0	 So think about this down stay example when planning training setups with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=667.0s	667.0	 How can you work on one piece of the puzzle at a time? One aspect that the dog is reacting to at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=674.0s	674.0	 Say, for example, you have a dog that is fine or OK when dogs are at a distance being calm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=681.0s	681.0	 but when they're close up and doing something very active, then the dog can overreact in that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=688.0s	688.0	 So how you might begin is work on making it the easiest scenario possible where your dog is at a distance they're comfortable from the other dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=697.0s	697.0	 and the other dog is not moving or doing something very casual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=701.0s	701.0	 Sometimes dogs don't like it when other dogs are really still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=704.0s	704.0	 But if they were walking around facing the other way, sniffing the grass, maybe that would be less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=709.0s	709.0	 They would be more comfortable with that specific situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=714.0s	714.0	 So you begin there and then what you could do is work on the proximity, how close you are to that dog when they're being calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=722.0s	722.0	 And then when you work on the dog doing more active behaviors, then you would have the dog as far away as possible and then add the two together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=731.0s	731.0	 So you could have the dog doing backflips even or fetching a ball or you could work your way up to really excitable behaviors like barking and playing tug with the owner while your dog is far enough away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=743.0s	743.0	 And then gradually add the two together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=746.0s	746.0	 I often get asked, but isn't this going to slow down the training process by breaking the steps up small and working on one at a time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=753.0s	753.0	 It seems like it's going to take forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=755.0s	755.0	 And the answer is no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=757.0s	757.0	 Actually, if a dog is by the dog being able to tell you what they're ready for in one training session, you could skip right on to meeting the other dog or, you know, drastically increasing criteria because the dog saying, yes, that's easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=774.0s	774.0	 Yes, that's easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=775.0s	775.0	 And then you can continue on with the harder tasks and with the dog that's saying, no, that's not the wonderful thing about breaking the aspects up or the triggers up and separating them and looking at them separately is sometimes you find triggers that you didn't know the dog had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=792.0s	792.0	 So, for example, with one dog, it was the jingling collar that really made them react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=799.0s	799.0	 So simply by jingling a dog's collar with no dog around the dog reacted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=803.0s	803.0	 So the owner could just work on jingling a collar for two weeks in the house before there was even a dog in the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=810.0s	810.0	 And then when the dog was in the picture, we had an elastic band around the dog's tags.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=816.0s	816.0	 So I suggest actually with any dog that you begin with the tags silenced when working with another dog and then work on the jingle of the dog and the noises dogs make separately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=827.0s	827.0	 If those you think might be part of the reason that your dog reacts to other dogs before working on the dog's triggers, teach the concept of the setup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=838.0s	838.0	 Teach the concept of the setup without the dog's triggers present by using a decoy that your dog likes and trusts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=844.0s	844.0	 For example, a family member or friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=847.0s	847.0	 Make sure the dog recognizes them at first so he doesn't get startled by them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=852.0s	852.0	 Do setups where you rehearse the movements you'll do in the training sessions with the real triggers until the dog has gotten to the point where he can quickly progress through the three steps of the protocol for raising criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=864.0s	864.0	 You can use this as a quick warm up before a real setup with a decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=869.0s	869.0	 It's a great test to see if the dog is ready for the training as the dog might be uninterested in the food or distracted before the trigger is even present.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=878.0s	878.0	 The reason that it's a good idea to teach the dog the concept of the setup is that your dog won't be learning something new while also being exposed to the trigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=887.0s	887.0	 Also, the handler can practice all the different skills and behaviors they need to do during a real setup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=893.0s	893.0	 What I usually do is work with my client's dog if he trusts me and teach the dog the concept of the setup using the client as the decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=903.0s	903.0	 Most dogs will want to look at their own owner and find it hard to look back at first so the client can watch the learning process before there is a trigger present.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=914.0s	914.0	 You will find there are a lot of triggers that you can work on with your dog before you need to use a strange dog or person as a decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=921.0s	921.0	 Most dogs will struggle with looking away from just their own owner running back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=927.0s	927.0	 The key to this training is creating predictability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=931.0s	931.0	 So to begin with, I like to work with a very predictable movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=936.0s	936.0	 So a movement that repeats every few seconds or limiting the movement to a specific area that's only about 10 feet wide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=944.0s	944.0	 Going from step three to step one when something new is added.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=950.0s	950.0	 In this footage, you can see that Gummy Bear is on step three where she can easily ignore Splash laying down at a distance from her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=959.0s	959.0	 However, because we've not worked on Splash getting up after laying down for a long period of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=966.0s	966.0	 the moment that Splash stands up is when the handler is going to mark Gummy Bear for looking over at Splash and mark every time that Gummy Bear looks over at Splash now that she's walking back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=979.0s	979.0	 Because we've never worked on Splash walking back and forth at this distance from Gummy Bear before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=986.0s	986.0	 After marking Gummy Bear for looking over at Splash multiple times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=990.0s	990.0	 Joanna is then going to wait and see if Gummy Bear will think to look back at her and she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1002.0s	1002.0	 If you have a dog that's had extensive training with offering behavior and the dog starts to look and look back at you as a behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1009.0s	1009.0	 I suggest waiting and seeing if you can get your dog to look at you with duration so you don't get that head movement of back and forth looking at you and looking at whatever it is in the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1020.0s	1020.0	 If this is hard for your dog, I suggest going back to working on a settle or duration eye contact when there's no trigger around first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1032.0s	1032.0	 Your dog might invent his own way of telling you he's ready for the next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1036.0s	1036.0	 Here Gummy Bear lifts up her chin as if to say this is easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1040.0s	1040.0	 Other dogs might go into a sit position or a down or any sort of behavior you might have reinforced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1051.0s	1051.0	 A big trigger for a lot of dogs is when another dog's face is pointing in their direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1055.0s	1055.0	 So you can use your body to block the view of the decoy dog's face at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1061.0s	1061.0	 If you're really worried that the decoy dog might look over, you can use healing or luring with a treat on the dog's nose and use high value treats and a high rate of reinforcement to prevent the decoy dog from looking over at the working dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1076.0s	1076.0	 You can use one of your hands as a blocker as I'm doing here, especially when the dogs are in close proximity to block the view of the decoy dog's eyes from the working dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1086.0s	1086.0	 You can also hold onto the harness and the collar when your hand is in that position just in case the decoy dog decides to look over at the working dog and that's going to create a setback for the working dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1103.0s	1103.0	 When the working dog is ready to see the decoy dog's face, you can have them at a 90 degree angle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1108.0s	1108.0	 I like to walk backwards slowly and get my dog to look up at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1113.0s	1113.0	 When the working dog is having success and you want to raise criteria and add movement of the working dog, I suggest having the decoy dog extremely still or doing extremely predictable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1127.0s	1127.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1130.0s	1130.0	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1132.0s	1132.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1135.0s	1135.0	 Twirl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1136.0s	1136.0	 If the working dog alerts to the sound of the decoy dog handler's cues, such as the handler telling the dog the dog is a good boy or saying something like sit or let's go or marking and reinforcing, what you can do is first have the handler have no dog and work on all those different cues that are going to be used such as sit down, spin, let's go, marking and reinforcing an invisible dog first until the working dog can calm down and then start to walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1166.0s	1166.0	 Sit down and be comfortable with that scenario first before bringing the dog into the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1173.0s	1173.0	 Then when the decoy dog is first brought into the picture, you can use the visual cues and luring rather than verbal cues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1182.0s	1182.0	 A very useful behavior is teaching the decoy dog to look at the working dog on cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1189.0s	1189.0	 I suggest treating being looked at as a trigger for any dog and work on it in your training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1205.0s	1205.0	 In most situations, unexpected movement is easier for dogs to handle when it's further away from them than when it's close up, so work on the trigger of movement at a distance first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6h66QKyD3o&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=136&pp=iAQB&t=1218.0s	1218.0	 Here's an example of keeping notes of your training sessions.
