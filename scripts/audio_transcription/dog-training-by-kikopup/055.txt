https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone! In this video I'm going to be going over expert tips and ideas for separation training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=6.2s	6.2	 Now it's important to understand that all dogs are different and require a different behavior modification plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=13.1s	13.1	 depending on the dog's personality, their previous life experience, their genetics, and their time in the womb with their mother and early life experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 So I suggest that you watch this video and the other videos that I've linked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=27.9s	27.9	 but there are also experts that can help you one-on-one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=31.8s	31.8	 I have a friend here in San Diego, Tina Flores, and she does online lessons through Malina DeMartini's program of separation anxiety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 where you can work one-on-one with a trainer on your dog's issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 So I suggest checking out those links below if you're struggling and you need some expert help to get you through this problem with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 In this video I'm going to be giving tips and ideas that I find can really boost your dog's confidence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=61.4s	61.4	 and even desire to be on their own or be in a confined area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 So some dogs they might have anxiety about being left just by themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=76.6s	76.6	 So if there's another dog there they're fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=79.9s	79.9	 Other dogs there might be one specific human family member that if that human leaves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 then they're panicked even though the rest of the family is still there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=91.4s	91.4	 So that can be very frustrating but it can also be very beneficial for training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=96.1s	96.1	 because those family members can not only observe the dog's behavior but reinforce the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 So there's a human being there that can help out with the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 So that actually makes it a little bit easier than when the dog is fearful of just everyone leaving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 I've lived with many dogs with separation anxiety myself and I've worked with a lot of clients with these issues over the years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=121.4s	121.4	 Tug My Terrier is a very interesting one because if my dog...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 You're probably wondering why do I have so many border collies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=132.3s	132.3	 There are many reasons because I love them but he does so well with the border collie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 So it was just Splash. I had Splash, my older border collie who is now passed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=145.6s	145.6	 And if I left the house and Splash was there he did so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=150.2s	150.2	 No anxiety. I could leave him like eight to ten hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 Not that I would but like in an emergency situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 I could leave him as long as humanly possible in an emergency and I'd come back and it was as though I had been there because Splash was there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=168.7s	168.7	 So when I leave Tug with a border collie he's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=172.4s	172.4	 So I do actually work and this is one of the tips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=175.8s	175.8	 I do actually work on him being separated from time to time because it does happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 Say for example he's at the vet or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=185.1s	185.1	 So he has to be separate from the family and from everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=189.6s	189.6	 So it's really important to work on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 If you have a dog that you're using the fact that there's a human always home or a dog that's always home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=198.9s	198.9	 Say maybe you have retired parents they're living in your house and you just assume they're always going to be able to be there to watch your dog for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 So in an emergency situation like having to go to the ER it's going to save your dog a lot of stress if you work on the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=216.3s	216.3	 One of the reasons that I'm making this video is the other day when I went out for a walk I opened the door and only five of my dogs came out with me because it was a very cold morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=226.6s	226.6	 And my little Chihuahua who I got who I adopted as a little puppy because the person who owned her could not deal with her anxiety about being left alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=237.5s	237.5	 She didn't want to come on the walk she preferred to stay home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 And so I left I was gone like an hour and a half I come back and she's just sleeping on the couch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=247.2s	247.2	 And then I thought you know it's not it just could be a fluke that it was really cold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=251.9s	251.9	 And then a few days later the same thing happened again where I wanted to go for a walk when it was really cold and she preferred to stay home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=260.2s	260.2	 And it was just one of those wonderful moments where all that training that I did right at the beginning you know paid off for life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=267.9s	267.9	 Because it was really just the first 30 days that I hyper focused on on training her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=274.7s	274.7	 And then I've just been reaping the results ever since so the next 16 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=279.5s	279.5	 So if you have a little puppy that you're working with I highly suggest that you that you sit down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=286.8s	286.8	 You get in touch with the trainer you write a behavior modification plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=290.7s	290.7	 And you really focus on working on the issue because if you just try and see if just leaving the dog alone and they might get better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=298.9s	298.9	 They might rehearse screaming and barking and howling and destroying things and panicking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=304.7s	304.7	 So they start to associate you leaving with this really really traumatic experience that can keep coming back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=313.1s	313.1	 So if a dog rehearses a behavior it's more likely to come back in the future in their behavioral repertoire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=320.9s	320.9	 Then if they never rehearsed it at all that is one of the reasons that I like to use something called errorless learning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=329.1s	329.1	 Which in fact the dogs do make errors but they're making very small errors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=334.6s	334.6	 Because you're breaking up the criteria into small achievable steps where they're not getting overly stressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=339.9s	339.9	 So you start to see the dog get a little stressed then you can modify the plan rather than the dog having a terrible reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=349.9s	349.9	 Because they got left when you went to the grocery store and then when you're back the couch is destroyed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=355.6s	355.6	 The curtains are ripped up or the dog is broken their canine teeth off because they tried to get out of a crate or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=363.4s	363.4	 Anyway so one of the tips that really worked with my little dog and I'm leading up to that because of the story about how she preferred to stay home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=373.4s	373.4	 Is using something reinforcing to the dog to make them prefer to be away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=380.9s	380.9	 So what I did and actually I already had it for my little Chihuahua Kiko is a heated bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=387.7s	387.7	 So it's actually warmer than my lap and when she found out about that she would prefer to go into the heated bed in my bedroom than be with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=397.5s	397.5	 So really it sounds mean but you can sit in the most uncomfortable room in your house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=403.8s	403.8	 Make it really uncomfortable for your dog. Go in your office make sure there's like no dog beds if they love cushy dog beds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=412.4s	412.4	 And then let your dog choose to go into to walk around and find out it's not comfortable and then they're going to go and seek out that heated bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=421.0s	421.0	 So along with these tips you want to make sure that you're training your dog and reinforcing your dog in training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=428.3s	428.3	 To choose their bed and to go lay down on their bed and to settle as well as choose their pen and lay in their pen and what to do when home alone or when you walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=438.4s	438.4	 So I'll link a video in the description below on how to train that. I have an actual video on how to train those specific things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=445.3s	445.3	 But once you've reinforced it the dog thinks oh there's nothing to lay on in here I'll go in the other room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 And then the dog is being reinforced for leaving you and going and finding a better something better where they're alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=459.3s	459.3	 The other thing is companionship. Sometimes a head start is having the dog with another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=465.0s	465.0	 So with Epic I actually used Kiko my other Chihuahua and I would leave her in a pen with Kiko who has amazing you know who's amazing about being left home alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=476.3s	476.3	 When she did start to get dementia it changed but when I had gotten Epic she was doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=485.8s	485.8	 So leaving your dogs with other dogs that are safe for the dog. Physically safe they're not going to hurt them or not oversight them or teach them some other undesirable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=496.0s	496.0	 But also great at being left alone. So not everybody has a dog like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=501.4s	501.4	 Another idea is if you have a large family you're a large quantity of the family leaves and one person stays home with the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=509.4s	509.4	 So you're working on just a smaller you know step a small step towards the entire family leaving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=516.5s	516.5	 As you can imagine I have lots of dogs so it's very different when many of the dogs are gone and there's just one dog or two dogs at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=524.8s	524.8	 So I vary I take my dogs out for different outings and split them up in groups and differ the groups so that they're being left home with different dogs rather than the same dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=538.3s	538.3	 And it's very sad that I lost two dogs last year but because I've done all this training about the dogs being okay with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=548.6s	548.6	 None of my dogs really suffered or mourned or felt that loss that the one dog just disappeared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=554.6s	554.6	 Because I really did work on them being separated. So Tug my little guy who was really attached to splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=562.6s	562.6	 My border collie who passed he did really well and adjusted really really nicely after after she left us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=570.4s	570.4	 Okay so getting on to some more tips. If you don't have a dog that's seeking warmth you might have a dog like a husky or a shepherd.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=579.1s	579.1	 Or a dog with a thick coat and you live somewhere that's warm or maybe you crank your heater because it's winter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=585.1s	585.1	 So you're leaving the dog in a place where they seek cool so they might go under a couch to seek the cool tile under there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=593.4s	593.4	 There might be a table they go under there might be a tile area around your fireplace somewhere that they seek.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=600.2s	600.2	 Maybe it's the bathroom that they go to that they really love.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=604.7s	604.7	 So the same with the heated bed idea you can begin by sitting near that area so they lay down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=612.5s	612.5	 They get real comfortable and what you do is you get up you move away a few steps and then you come back and sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=619.8s	619.8	 So you're sitting near them you walk away come back walk away come back walk away come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=624.9s	624.9	 And at first they might be like oh my gosh she's walking away but then you come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=629.4s	629.4	 And then you can get to the point where you can walk away and come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=632.3s	632.3	 And what they really want is that nice cool area or the heated bed that they're at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=637.6s	637.6	 And they know that you're going to come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=640.4s	640.4	 So then you just increase the amount of time that you leave and come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=645.8s	645.8	 But you're habituating them to the fact that when you leave you come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=650.2s	650.2	 It's you're not reinforcing them specifically with food or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=656.0s	656.0	 But you are reinforcing them by returning while they're still relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=659.8s	659.8	 So they're relaxed you've returned so you're reinforcing them with your company.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=664.5s	664.5	 But they're also being reinforced with the cool feeling underneath them or the heated bed that's very comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=673.9s	673.9	 So you can do that idea and then when you do leave them in a pen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=679.0s	679.0	 You leave them with something cool to lay on or the heated bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=683.5s	683.5	 Now if you're worried about a heated bed home alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=686.6s	686.6	 They do have you can set it up so the heat is underneath the like a grate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=699.3s	699.3	 And the cord is protected and then there's a bed on top so they're not going to chew on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=703.9s	703.9	 But if you're really worried about the dog chewing on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=706.3s	706.3	 You could start it out with like a heated some heated pet pad that you heat up in the microwave.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=741.6s	741.6	 So my ex my ex-wife she has two sight hounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=747.1s	747.1	 She had one sight hound that had never been left alone for four for four years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=751.8s	751.8	 And and finally when we like made success where the dog could be left for four for four hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=758.1s	758.1	 We got another another sight hound that had the same issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=761.7s	761.7	 So we had so we had the same issue again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=766.4s	766.4	 And it was really exhausting really exhausting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=778.6s	778.6	 And for those two dogs it was just my ex-wife that was they were attached to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=784.5s	784.5	 So I could sit and feed them treats while she left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=788.1s	788.1	 And I could work on it was almost like I didn't exist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=790.9s	790.9	 It makes you feel great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=793.0s	793.0	 But it was very helpful for the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=795.6s	795.6	 But those dogs as well as epic using the car as the first place to leave them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=802.2s	802.2	 is really really beneficial because most puppies and adult dogs if you haven't left them in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=809.0s	809.0	 car most people don't leave their dogs in the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=811.5s	811.5	 Some people might to rush into a store if they live in a country that's freezing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=816.0s	816.0	 like Sweden or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=817.4s	817.4	 But most people won't leave their dogs in the car because they're worried they'll get stolen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=821.3s	821.3	 or something bad will happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=823.2s	823.2	 So the car they have a prehistory of you always being in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=828.2s	828.2	 And most people ignore their dogs because they're driving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=831.3s	831.3	 So you don't have any of those superstitious behaviors that you're doing when your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=835.0s	835.0	 anxious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=836.4s	836.4	 Also if you've really worked on crate training the dog is the dog is settled in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=844.3s	844.3	 So you have that that you worked on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=846.3s	846.3	 So this using the car it also requires that you teach your dog to settle in a crate and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=850.7s	850.7	 the crate is in the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=853.0s	853.0	 If you have a helper of course that's way easier to drive and have a helper train your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=859.1s	859.1	 I'm not suggesting you should train your dog as you're driving but say you're on your street
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=865.0s	865.0	 or your driveway or where your car is parked you get in your car you ignore your dog you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=869.4s	869.4	 could even turn the engine on you reinforce your dog in the in the seat that they're in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=875.5s	875.5	 in their crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=876.8s	876.8	 If you have a puppy maybe they're in a little tiny baggie or crate in the front while you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=883.3s	883.3	 parked if you are think that's unsafe you can put it in the back when you're actually driving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=887.8s	887.8	 and work on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=888.6s	888.6	 But the first step is just sitting next to the puppy or maybe you're sitting in the back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=891.8s	891.8	 seat feeding through the crate and reinforcing the puppy for settling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=896.6s	896.6	 You could read a book you could do whatever you want listen to music a podcast turn on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=901.2s	901.2	 the radio and then once your puppy or adult dog is relaxed laying in the crate you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=906.4s	906.4	 going to get out of the car and then get immediately back in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=909.3s	909.3	 So you get out of the door come back in get out of the door come back in and the great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=912.6s	912.6	 thing about a car is they can see you through all the windows so you could walk around the car come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=918.2s	918.2	 back in go around the other way come back in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=921.5s	921.5	 And so for for Epic my little Chihuahua I would put her in the car in the crate we would drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=927.8s	927.8	 to a dog park a dog park a park to walk my other dogs and I'd have her in a backpack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=933.5s	933.5	 because I couldn't leave her alone I could leave her you know with friends or family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=938.4s	938.4	 to sit her while I was gone but I had her in a backpack walked her with my dogs and one of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=943.2s	943.2	 steps to being away from me was that she was on my back so she knew I was there because my arms were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=948.1s	948.1	 there but it was one of those small approximations of being alone is that she you know all the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=953.8s	953.8	 dogs were ahead and she was looking out from behind so having her own private time but we were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=959.1s	959.1	 there so that's one option a backpack to get those dogs used to a mini step towards being comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=967.0s	967.0	 being by themselves. Another thing is when I would drive out my driveway the first time I got out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=973.8s	973.8	 the car to open the front gate and then close it to get the car through that small amount of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=980.8s	980.8	 of opening the gate and getting back in the car she panicked so so I was running or putting the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaHlZsC5CZs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=56&pp=iAQB&t=1007.9s	1007.9	 getting back in she's getting out she's getting back in she's not leaving so it's really about
