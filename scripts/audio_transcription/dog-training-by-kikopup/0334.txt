https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, I'm going to show you how I train the trick, Jump Through the Arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 Now, Wish here is 13 months old, so we've just started working on jumping tricks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 and I wanted to show you what we've been working on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 So this trick, Jumping Through the Hoop, we've been working on for about a week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 and so I can go through all the steps on how to train it here with Wish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 Now, with a dog that can get really excited about toys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 I suggest working first on behaviors that can have a lot of enthusiasm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 with food first, then get precision, and once you've got precision,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 then move on to using toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 So, the first step is simply tossing the treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 and seeing that your dog can find it on the surface that you're using.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 So she's really good at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 Earlier I was using cheese, because it shows up easily on this carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Great. So once your dog's doing that, you need a barrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 So I suggest training jumping tricks outside on the grass,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 where there's more of a cushion for the landing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 So usually I'm working outside, and I'll use a chair at first to train the barrier, or fencing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 So you need a wall, a chair, a tree, or some fence that you can use as a barrier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 and you're simply going to toss the treat over your arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 Now, for some dogs, you might need to put your arm way down on the ground,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 like if you have a little chihuahua.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 Also, be careful if your dog is used to jumping on chairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 I would suggest use a wall, if your dog is used to jumping on top of platforms and things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 So use a wall first, so that you don't have a dog jumping on or at the chair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 Okay, so when the dog is confident at going over your arm like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 I would lift the arm up just a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 and see if you can get a nice little jump over that arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 Now that the dog is widely jumping over your arm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 you can add your marker, where you're saying, good, that's exactly what I want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 So if you want to use a clicker, you can hold it in the hand that is the beginning of your hoop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 But if you don't have a very soft-sounding clicker,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 or your dog isn't used to this, they can be quite aligned that the click is happening right in their ear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 So you can just use a marker word like, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 When your dog is reliably jumping over your arm, you can start to vary how high it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 So you can make it a little higher, a little bit lower,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 and get your dog used to it being something taller to jump over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Now you want to make sure you're tossing your treat far enough,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 because as you saw earlier, I tossed it too short,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 and Wish had to do a handstand in order to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 You want to get that muscle memory of taking a nice jump over your arm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 in anticipation of the treat being further away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 You also want to start your dog jumping at a distance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 rather than right up next to your arm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 because then it's going to be harder for the dog to jump over your arm at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 When your dog is reliably jumping over your arm, you can start to fade your treat tossing gesture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 So what I like to do is pretend to toss a treat, say yes as the dog jumps,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 and then give a treat so that your hand signal becomes the signal to jump at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 Are you ready? Wishy, go get it! Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 So this gesture, yes, without actually, yes, tossing the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 So your dog might cut in on to the fact that you're pretending to toss a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 so you can always go back and toss a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 Yes! Yes! Good job! Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 The final step is to create a hoop with your arms and have your dog jump through them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 Now, I suggest making a hoop like this, rather than making a hoop like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 I find that this is more uncomfortable, and you're blocking your face from whatever audience you have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 so you do a hoop like that, and you keep your face out of the way as the dog jumps through,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 because if you look through the hoop, you might get a broken nose if your dog is big enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 If you have a larger dog, you could use a hula hoop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 or if you have something else to hold on to, like a cane or a frisbee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 you can make your hoop larger by holding on to something to get the dog to jump through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 Are you ready? Ready? Go get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 So actually I have two cues. Hup means jump over the arm, and jump through means jump through. Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 Here you can see I'm working on the behavior outside with Wish, and I'm increasing the height that she jumps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 When your dog isn't just stepping over your arm, it's important to warm your dog up before training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 as well as cool your dog down afterwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 If you're unsure about your dog's well-being, check with a physical therapist first before working on jumping tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 This footage is taken a week after I filmed the tutorial inside my house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 and as you can see, now that I'm using the toy, I can build enthusiasm for this jumping trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 Here are a couple of variations of jumping tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVivnOwiMoA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=335&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 Check the written description below for links to my videos on how to train some of these variations.
