https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody. This video is on the topic of how it is possible to train reliable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=6.1s	6.1	 recalls with dogs using positive reinforcement. Now I frequently get asked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=11.9s	11.9	 how can you train a dog to come back away from something say an a squirrel or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=19.6s	19.6	 a deer or a rabbit or something they're excited about like a car or people or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=25.4s	25.4	 dogs or or a body of water they want to jump in. How can you teach the dog to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=31.2s	31.2	 come away and come back to you from these things that they want to do with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=36.7s	36.7	 piece of food that they don't even want to eat in those moments that they're so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=40.7s	40.7	 excited. So I'm going to briefly explain how this is possible. Now what you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=45.9s	45.9	 shouldn't do is try to train the dog to come back to you when they don't want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 what you have. They don't want your food, they want to do the thing in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=55.3s	55.3	 environment or they're just so aroused they can't even learn at that point in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=60.3s	60.3	 time. So you can't, it's true, you can't use positive reinforcement using food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=66.3s	66.3	 and toys and access to the environment when a dog is that excited. So the key is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=72.3s	72.3	 creating a training plan where you break the steps up smaller where the dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=77.3s	77.3	 never getting that excited. So I'm going to show you some footage of my terrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=82.9s	82.9	 in response to he was very prey driven and he wanted to just chase and I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 know what he wanted to do probably kill whatever it was that he saw. So I'll show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=94.7s	94.7	 you some footage of him before the training and then footage of him after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=99.1s	99.1	 and the key is is instead of trying to train him to listen to me when there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 prey around I instead worked on counter conditioning teaching him to be calm and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=110.3s	110.3	 ignore the animals in the environment. So I'll show you the footage of him after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=116.6s	116.6	 training him to relax and do nothing when there's prey in the environment and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=121.7s	121.7	 I actually do have a protocol on how I do this emotional and behavioral
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 modification process and that I'll link in the description below. I have yet to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=132.5s	132.5	 make a free YouTube video on the protocol but I hope to soon. Tug the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=137.7s	137.7	 terrier excited about wildlife.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=149.1s	149.1	 After teaching the dogs to be calm around wildlife. Here's some footage of my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=155.1s	155.1	 terrier just sniffing around in the morning on my property and there's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=158.7s	158.7	 rabbit that runs out in front of him and he just looks curiously at it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 there's one on the hosepipe that runs away but he doesn't even notice it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=168.3s	168.3	 because there's always a lot of rabbits in my backyard. I had to work with my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 dogs around chickens and I also worked with them around rabbits, pet rabbits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=180.5s	180.5	 And here is when I lived in Sweden and there's some a huge herd of deer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=186.8s	186.8	 running through the forest. There were always rabbits and squirrels on my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=192.3s	192.3	 property but they never dared go into my backyard that's fenced where my dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=197.3s	197.3	 like to hang out and so the first time that the squirrels came in which is in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 this footage the dogs were mildly interested because there was someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=206.9s	206.9	 new in their property but as you can see you know one really did anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=217.7s	217.7	 The rabbits and the squirrels soon figured out that my dogs don't chase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 them so they would come and live in my backyard obviously for safety reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=226.7s	226.7	 and because of the food source so I actually had to start chasing them away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 myself because it started to get ridiculous how many squirrels and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 rabbits were sharing the yard with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=249.5s	249.5	 Here my dogs run to the training field and ignore the rabbit they scare while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=254.3s	254.3	 running in a group. As you can see in the footage the dogs don't need food around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=263.6s	263.6	 or to be told what to do when there's prey they don't need to be told to leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=267.9s	267.9	 it it's almost like the prey has become unimportant stimuli in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=273.7s	273.7	 environment such as blowing leaves or to dogs who aren't interested in cars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=278.5s	278.5	 traffic and people walking by that they have no interest in. So even though when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=284.6s	284.6	 I kicked that object and the squirrel underneath went whizzing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=291.2s	291.2	 past that wasn't a toy to my dog so he had absolutely no interest in that but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=296.7s	296.7	 if I had rolled a ball instead of a squirrel he would have got super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=300.7s	300.7	 excited and gone and grabbed the ball. So we can condition dogs to be calm and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=306.3s	306.3	 relaxed around other stimuli and show self-control so instead of trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 use food or toys to compete or distract your dog to get them to come back to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=320.7s	320.7	 you can actually use conditioning where you're you're teaching your dog to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 calm and relaxed around everything and then like my dogs when I walk somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=331.1s	331.1	 and they're off leash they're not really that interested in anything else besides
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=335.7s	335.7	 me so I can easily call them away from other things but it's not because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=340.9s	340.9	 spent months and months working on a recall. In fact with my latest puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=347.2s	347.2	 who's laying just below me, Halo, I only did maybe five or ten training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=353.3s	353.3	 on the actual recall and proofing the recall and the important part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=358.1s	358.1	 training was teaching him to be calm around different types of distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=362.5s	362.5	 that might excite him like wildlife, fast-moving cars and bicycles and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=368.4s	368.4	 skateboards and things like that which he was interested in. Teaching your dog to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 be calm around things that make him excited in the environment. It does take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 time but the amazing thing is that when you reinforce your dog for enjoying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=382.2s	382.2	 being calm around these things usually if you've done it right you don't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 to go and do brush-up training. So you know I live in the country and there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=392.5s	392.5	 squirrels and rabbits all over my property and nobody gets excited by them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=396.6s	396.6	 because we worked on it and they don't even see them as something interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=400.7s	400.7	 anymore or the neighbors dogs when they come running up and barking at the fence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=404.8s	404.8	 they don't even see them it's just like birds tweeting in the trees or crows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=409.3s	409.3	 flying through the sky for them. So instead of trying to teach your dog to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=413.8s	413.8	 come back to you when he's excited about someone playing soccer at the park or a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 loose dog running in the park you could instead work on a calm settle on a mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=423.3s	423.3	 with the distractions far enough away that your dog can completely ignore them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=427.9s	427.9	 and then gradually get your dog closer where he can relax and receive treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=433.2s	433.2	 between his paws for calmly observing the environment and not fixating on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=438.8s	438.8	 whatever it is that he was excited about before and then when you can do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=443.3s	443.3	 then you can imagine how easy it is to train the the recall with those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=448.5s	448.5	 distractions. If you want to know how to train the calm settle I have a link in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=459.4s	459.4	 concept to consider when trying to train a really reliable recall. The other thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=464.9s	464.9	 that I wanted to talk about is giving your dog access to what he wants for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=471.2s	471.2	 coming back to you. So if you're just using food or toys and the dog is weighing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=477.6s	477.6	 what's more reinforcing in the environment even though you are using a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=481.4s	481.4	 high rate of reinforcement perhaps the dog is finding it punishing to come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=486.2s	486.2	 to you because he's leaving something that's better. For example if you were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=490.8s	490.8	 having a delicious dessert out at a restaurant socially distancing of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=497.0s	497.0	 course or maybe in the past before the pandemic so you're really enjoying your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=517.9s	517.9	 couple of times you're gonna be like no thank you I fell for that the first time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=522.4s	522.4	 I'd rather be eating this dessert that I have now. So when we train dogs to listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKG2Ht1FlA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=529.8s	529.8	 to us and they know that by listening to us they they get access to what they
