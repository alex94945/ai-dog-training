https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 I'm first going to warm him up and get the behavior that I want, which is him running to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 So I'm just going to back up and as he comes towards me I'm going to click and feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 And we want to do this lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 And then when I get the behavior I want reliably I can start adding the cue here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 So I'm going to say, bear, here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 And I click him for coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 Bear, here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 Bear, here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 And I don't have to feed on the ground, but it's a good way of getting to be faster than your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 Because if you feed them in their mouth they can catch up to you really fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 Now this is the hard part that we add.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 It's the distraction. It's calling them away from something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 For example, if it was a dead rat or something you want to be able to call them away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 So I'm going to put the treats down there and then I'm going to say, bear, here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 Now if he didn't come with me I could walk backwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 Bear, here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 And now I'm going to click him for staying with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 So he's not just darting back to the thing that he wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 He's genuinely staying with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 If it was another dog over there and I want to release him to go play again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 maybe it's Bella that I'm calling him away from,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 I'm going to say, okay, go say hi or okay, go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 And then he can eat the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 So it's not really a leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 It depends how you want to play the exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 They could never get it or they could get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Maybe it's his ball. Maybe it's a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 Bear, here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 Basically by repetition it becomes easier for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 Bear, here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 Step two, add a cue like here or come and click as the dog is in motion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 and feed for the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 Step three, once your dog is reliably coming without distraction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 add distractions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9gTe0jPJbU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=411&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 back up so the dog is further away and try again.
