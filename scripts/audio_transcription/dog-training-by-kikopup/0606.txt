https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgBvnQ71ss&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=609&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 And as they go onto the mat, click and treat. So any targeting of the treat on the mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgBvnQ71ss&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=609&pp=iAQB&t=17.6s	17.6	 equals a click and throw the treat on the mat. One way to speed up the process is have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgBvnQ71ss&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=609&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 your dog throw a treat on the mat and as they go to the mat, click and treat and feed on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgBvnQ71ss&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=609&pp=iAQB&t=43.7s	43.7	 that again. So throw the treat onto the mat, let the dog go, they go get the treat and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgBvnQ71ss&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=609&pp=iAQB&t=49.7s	49.7	 they click and treats happen on the mat while they're still there. Okay. Good girl. Now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgBvnQ71ss&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=609&pp=iAQB&t=61.8s	61.8	 I'm going to wait her out, pretend I throw a treat. If they're too smart and they know

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgBvnQ71ss&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=609&pp=iAQB&t=74.8s	74.8	 Good girl. So I'm going to pretend to throw a treat on the mat so she goes to look for
