https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone! In this video I'm going to be showing you how you can teach two dogs to weave your legs at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=7.4s	7.4	 Now it's important to understand that your dogs have to be comfortable with each other to do this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 So I suggest first watching the video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 in the description below that goes over how to work with dogs so that they feel comfortable and confident doing tricks together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=23.2s	23.2	 And if you are a little bit uncertain about your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=26.8s	26.8	 maybe they don't get on well with your other dog or they're fearful or stressed when being near your other dog working for food or perhaps they guard food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 It's important to seek help from a professional trainer that uses no forms of intimidation to work on these issues before trying to get your dogs to work in close proximity doing tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 Okay, so we'll begin with Epic and Tug because they've not worked on this trick yet before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=52.8s	52.8	 The first step is teaching the dogs the trick on their own separately before then adding them together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 So I would get quite a few leg weaves where the dog can weave your legs for quite a few times alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 And then when you work on them together the rate of reinforcement goes skyrocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=71.8s	71.8	 So they're getting treats for doing very minimal amount of work and that's going to really make them want to work together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 If you have one dog that's more body sensitive or space aware than the other I suggest having that dog follow the first dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 So my little puppy is going to go first and Tug is going to trail her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 Or if they're going to go at the same time together through the legs what's going to happen is Epic is going to be on the inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=96.8s	96.8	 So Tug sandwiches her in there rather than him having to be sandwiched between my leg and the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=104.8s	104.8	 So he'll be on the outside and if he wanted to create space he can move away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 I'm going to begin by having one dog weave my legs at a time and just go through one leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 So I'm going to ask Epic to weave my legs while I hold the treat up here for Tug so he's waiting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=119.8s	119.8	 And then I'm going to ask Tug to go legs. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 And pick him up over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=124.8s	124.8	 Then I'm going to ask Epic again while I hold the treat up here for Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=128.8s	128.8	 And I can even reinforce him for waiting and then tell him to go through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 Good boy. Epic legs, Tug legs. Good. Epic go legs, Tug go legs. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=143.8s	143.8	 Epic go legs, Tug. Good boy. Epic, Tug, go legs. Epic, Tug, go legs. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=151.8s	151.8	 For double dog tricks like this where you might worry the dogs will bump into each other if they make an error or you make an error,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=158.8s	158.8	 I really like clarity. So I always begin with the same picture that the dogs are doing a specific behavior before the leg weaving starts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 And I always use the same leg to begin with because if I use my right leg sometimes and my left leg other times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 it can be very confusing and you might get dogs bumping into each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=176.8s	176.8	 So you can also slow down the tricks when they're working together if you're worried that the dogs are going to bump into each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=184.8s	184.8	 Are you ready? Go legs, go legs. Good. Go legs, go legs. Good. Go legs, go legs. Tight. Touch, touch, touch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afpSZlHw5g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=164&pp=iAQB&t=200.8s	200.8	 Go legs. Heel. Touch, touch, touch. Good. Sit, sit pretty. Both paws. Good.
