https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, this video is for those of you who have just adopted a new dog or puppy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=6.1s	6.1	 the dog is over excited or over aroused when you try to use treats to train your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=11.4s	11.4	 Now if you just ignore your dog's excitement, some dogs could habituate to using food and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=17.3s	17.3	 calm down, but most often they will stay that excited about food or even become more and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=23.3s	23.3	 more excited the more training you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 So it's really important to first focus on your dog's arousal level for the treats that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=31.6s	31.6	 you're using because if you skip this step and you just use treats and your dog's too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 excited what can happen is that your dog will always be too excited when you train and it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 can get in the way of learning new behaviors because your dog's just so excited it makes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=46.4s	46.4	 it hard to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=47.7s	47.7	 It can also have the effect that when you ask your dog for specific behaviors that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=52.7s	52.7	 when they were too excited they become too excited as they do them so you might get whining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 and barking or just over excitement whenever you say the cue like sit or down or spin or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=64.7s	64.7	 something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=66.1s	66.1	 So to solve that problem I'm going to talk to you about some of the things that you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=70.7s	70.7	 do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=71.7s	71.7	 The first thing that you want to do is work on capturing calmness around food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=75.2s	75.2	 I have a full video tutorial on how to do this and I'll link it in the description,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 but basically you're going to have low value treats in your treat bag for five days and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 then once your dog is successful with that you can move on to higher value treats but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=88.8s	88.8	 start with very low value treats so it's easy for your dog and you're just going to wear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 your treat bag around the house and those moments that you notice your dog calm, relaxed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=98.3s	98.3	 and not thinking about the food and how to get it you're going to get some food calmly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=102.8s	102.8	 walk over and place the treat between your dog's paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=108.9s	108.9	 Then you're going to wait for the next moment that your dog is calm, settled and not thinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 about the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 An added benefit to this exercise is that it makes it much faster to teach long duration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 behaviors like a down stay or teaching your dog to wait for their turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=124.2s	124.2	 The next thing that you want to do is teach your dog to take treats nicely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=128.1s	128.1	 I'll link a tutorial on three games on how to train this important behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 Now you also want to keep in mind how you deliver the treat to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=137.6s	137.6	 If your dog gets overexcited by food you don't want to make your dog more excited by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=142.7s	142.7	 way you deliver the treat so you want to refrain from moving your hand fast, waving the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 around or throwing the treat if you have a dog that's already excited about food because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=152.6s	152.6	 you can make them way too excited by food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=155.6s	155.6	 As you can see I've done with my terrier here and it can interfere with your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=160.5s	160.5	 So instead of a fast treat delivery with a dog that's very aroused by food you can use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=166.1s	166.1	 a slow treat delivery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=167.9s	167.9	 So I'm going to get the treat and slowly move it towards the dog like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=172.5s	172.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=173.5s	173.5	 And you'll see it'll take a little bit longer to help calm him down because I got him quite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 Good job, Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=184.1s	184.1	 It takes some time to learn the skill of moving slow because naturally we want to move fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 A slow treat delivery can also help for a dog that's handshy and worried about fast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=194.7s	194.7	 movement and it can help calm that dog down and trust you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 Good job, Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=200.4s	200.4	 And finally if you're going to be using food as a lure where your dog follows a treat to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 learn new behaviors I don't suggest jumping in and trying to use food as a lure to train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=210.7s	210.7	 behaviors first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 I first suggest you teach your dog the concept of following food to learn a behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 I'll link a video tutorial below in the description.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 dog's face and wiggling it around and moving it which can make your dog over aroused instantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bXf5TZ3q28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=269&pp=iAQB&t=231.2s	231.2	 and try to bite and lick your hand you can hold the food above the dog and click your
