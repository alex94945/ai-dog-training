https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BP2JZduc64&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=476&pp=iAQB&t=3.0s	3.0	 The first step of teaching a dog to skateboard is to teach the dog to get onto the board while the board is steady.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BP2JZduc64&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=476&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 Once your dog is confident getting on the skateboard, you can gently move the skateboard so the dog gets used to the fact that the skateboard is an unstable surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BP2JZduc64&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=476&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 To teach balance, you can also teach your dog to move while on the skateboard as well as move onto different positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BP2JZduc64&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=476&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 If at any point your dog looks nervous or unhappy, go back a step and make it easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BP2JZduc64&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=476&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 You want to build your dog's confidence step by step so they're always succeeding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BP2JZduc64&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=476&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 Practice the free mount where the board is on the ground by itself and the dog gets onto the board, causing it to move forward slightly.
