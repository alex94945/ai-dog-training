https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=5.3s	5.3	 Now there are many ways that dogs sit but there are two general ways that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=10.3s	10.3	 people want to train their dog to sit from the standing position and one way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=14.9s	14.9	 is that they keep their front feet still and then they move their back feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 towards their front to get into the sit position and then there's also the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=23.4s	23.4	 where the dog is standing and they walk back into the sitting position keeping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 their back feet stationary. So if you want to teach that sit I actually have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=32.8s	32.8	 a video on position changes that I created and actually that video is is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 why I got a lot of requests for how do I actually teach a tucked sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=43.9s	43.9	 Luring the behavior. If your dog has a rock back sit that has a verbal cue like sit you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=50.3s	50.3	 begin by using that cue so I'm going to cue him to sit using his rock back cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=56.3s	56.3	 at first so he understands to get into the sit position but I'm also going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=60.9s	60.9	 be moving away from him and encouraging him to move towards me so I might be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 able to get him to do the tucked sit which I actually haven't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=71.5s	71.5	 trained until now so he's a good dog to demo with because what we've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 working on is the stand to sit like that with the back feet stationary. So what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 I'm going to do is say sit and then free and then move away and feed him treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=87.5s	87.5	 right here in front of me like this in the front position and then I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 cue him to sit. Good and what I'm doing is I'm lifting my hands up like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 rather than the cue for sit the rock back sit which is moving the hands into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=104.2s	104.2	 him like that instead I'm doing a gesture like this as I move away. Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=110.3s	110.3	 So I'm lifting the treat up like this. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=122.2s	122.2	 Good. Sit. Good. And I don't want to ruin my other cue so as soon as I see him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 offering the behavior that I want which is tucking forwards and keeping his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 front feet still I'm then going to add the new cue and the cue that I use is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=141.3s	141.3	 called tuck which is maybe not a cue that you want to use so you might think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 of a different one because tuck is kind of weird to say in public and it sounds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 like one of my dog's names who his name is tug so it's not the best cue. Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 Tuck. Good. Back. Good. And to teach them to get into the stand position after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 sitting if the dog knows the cue to back up you just cue them back back up while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=173.3s	173.3	 they're sitting and the back feet usually will pop out. Another method is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 tossing a treat away from you and sitting like this and then lifting the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 treat up like this as the dog comes towards you to sit. Good. And you can try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=188.3s	188.3	 using your the cue that you already have. Ready? Sit. Good. So there he rocks back a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=195.4s	195.4	 little bit and I could jiggle the treat like that to get him to come forwards to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=199.2s	199.2	 get it. Now he's walking into my lap which I don't particularly want him to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 do so I'm not gonna jiggle the treat too high. Good. Go get it. Tuck. Good. Come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=213.8s	213.8	 forwards a little bit. There. That's nice. Good job. Good boy. Ready? Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=222.4s	222.4	 If your dog is used to the rock back sit I suggest using high value treats like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=228.9s	228.9	 this cooked steak or a high value toy to get that excitement and movement forwards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 at first. Using a prop. You can use a couch or a bed for this exercise. Lower

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 slightly further away. Most dogs will inch forwards to get closer to you and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=253.1s	253.1	 the reinforcement by getting closer to the edge of the couch. You can also use

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI-ZCEKgsfE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=187&pp=iAQB&t=297.3s	297.3	 see the treat anymore so they come forwards to check out where that treat
