https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 Your dog does need to know how to stay in a sit or a down position, however.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 Oh, good job, splashers!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 The first time I saw this trick was about 10 years by a trainer, Pera Saavedra, in Spain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 Ever since then I've seen people using the trick and I think it's still a very adorable trick because it looks like you're making a connection with your dog in your trick routine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 It's a very simple trick to train with your dog in a sit or a down. It depends on your dog what might look better for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 I like the down position. You ask your dog to stay in the down position, so wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 Then you walk behind your dog. If your dog's not used to you walking behind them, then you can click them for staying in the position at first just so that you get that stable position while you're behind your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 Once your dog can stay happily in the down position while you're behind them, you're going to then start to move from one side to the other and click your dog for turning his head to the left and the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 At first it may take some time for your dog to think to look the other way. If you have a dog with a very bendy neck, they might just look back at you like that, which is something that my terrier does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 Once your dog is getting the hang of it, where you step to the left and your dog looks to the left and you step to the right and your dog looks to the right, you can start to gradually move less and less.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 Just you leaning to the left or the right initiates the movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Good! Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 Then you're going to feed your dog in the direction that they face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 Are you ready, Splashers? You can also practice it while you're turning back to back so you're mirroring each other's movements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 Splash has already added a verbal cue. Once your dog is doing it, you can say the cue just before you move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 I can say, look right, look left, look right, look left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 If you want to get more advanced, once your dog has learned the cue, look right, good, look left, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 Look right, Splash, look right, look left, look right, look left, awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 Sit, wait, look, ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 Look right, good, look left, look right, look left, awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSe7xy0fI0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=333&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 Cross, switch, cross.
