https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, I'd love to introduce you to my newest little family member here, an eight week old border collie puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=7.7s	7.7	 A lovely couple was rehoming him and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 It was a surprise puppy. I didn't I wasn't planning on getting a border collie puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=15.8s	15.8	 But I'm I mean I just saw him and and it was destiny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=20.8s	20.8	 I mean, he's just so amazing and so confident and just so wonderful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 Sorry to boast but of course, you know all puppies can be overwhelming so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 He's just perfect in every way. But of course, he's my first puppy. That's quite mouthy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=41.5s	41.5	 So he's biting at my hands a lot, you know going to try and bite my hands a lot and my feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 So I've always felt a little uncomfortable making no biting videos because I always never get a very mouthy puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=53.6s	53.6	 So I'm like yay. I finally got a mouthy puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 What I like to tell a lot of people that have mouthy puppies is that that usually means they've been pretty social in their puppyhood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=66.1s	66.1	 Because they've been playing games with litter mates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=69.2s	69.2	 When a puppy doesn't mouth at all that is more worrisome to me than if they're really mouthy now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=76.1s	76.1	 of course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=76.6s	76.6	 There's abnormal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 Mouthing where they're viciously biting you and drawing blood and it's inappropriate and really worrisome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 And then you might want to get a veterinary behaviorist involved in your training, but just a little bit of mouthing is great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 It's normal. Hey pup ups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 So along with training him not to bite my hands and my clothes and my feet when they're walking or go and bite my little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=100.6s	100.6	 Dogs when they run past or bite the tails of my border collies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=104.2s	104.2	 I'm also working on him teaching him to know what is appropriate to play with with his mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=110.6s	110.6	 So from day one the moment he got here we started interacting with all the toys that I wanted him to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=118.4s	118.4	 Interested in and go to look for when he wants to play and use his mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 The mouth of a little puppy is similar to the hand of a toddler so they need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=128.7s	128.7	 to put things into their mouth and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=131.7s	131.7	 investigate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=132.9s	132.9	 To grow normally so you know if we just say oh, let's not have him bite on anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 That's not going to create a healthy puppy. They need to do all this investigating with their mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=145.3s	145.3	 So we just need to show them the appropriate things to do it with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=148.8s	148.8	 So you might want to get a couple of different textures of toys. These are all soft toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=153.4s	153.4	 but there's some rubber toys back there and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=156.8s	156.8	 If your puppy is just not interested in your toys and keeps going for other things just try getting different toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 To see what your puppy is interested in and then also don't have too many out because if you have a ton of toys out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=170.3s	170.3	 What can happen is the puppy could possibly?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 Start to believe that anything on the floor is free so if you had some shoes, and then there's some toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 It's hard to make the association
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 So just having a couple toys that they you've really created a reinforcement history with playing with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 and really enjoying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 Investigating and playing with those toys, so I've had him a day, and we've really built this and like all my other puppies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=198.2s	198.2	 He's not chewing on anything and he can be loose in the house because I take him out frequently to go to the bathroom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 So I really like to teach puppies right from the start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 by reinforcing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=211.6s	211.6	 Appropriate choices to be loose in the house in that way they can choose what they want to do so when he's loose I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 Supervising him 100% of the time, and I'm really making that effort in the first few days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=225.1s	225.1	 Which is very exhausting to make sure that he can be loose because that's the end goal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=230.4s	230.4	 So I have the doors to other rooms closed and if he goes around the corner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=234.7s	234.7	 I'll you know get him back or follow him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=237.4s	237.4	 And I'm just making sure that he's making appropriate choices while out loose and at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=243.8s	243.8	 I'm making sure he doesn't pee so I if I see him going to sniff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=247.7s	247.7	 Then I'll say pop-ups, and we'll rush out the door or if an activity is ended
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=253.8s	253.8	 So if he's drank water if he's done eating treats or his breakfast if he's done playing if he's done napping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 Then I'll take him out to make sure that he's gone to the bathroom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=264.5s	264.5	 So when I do need to get work done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=266.3s	266.3	 I'll have him in an environment where he can't make any mistakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 So usually I work in my office and I have him in a pen or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 Loosen my office because there's nothing on the floor for a little pup to get into and then that way I can monitor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=280.6s	280.6	 Him all the time when he's loose in the house and set him up for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=285.1s	285.1	 I already have a tutorial starring one of my other border Collies as a puppy on how to teach your dog to not mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=292.6s	292.6	 you or your hands or feet when you're moving around and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=297.1s	297.1	 In that video you'll see that the puppy is actually mouthing on something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=301.6s	301.6	 Because people are always like oh you're using on an already trained dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=306.1s	306.1	 But the thing with positive reinforcement is you set the dog up for success so before I'm even starting the training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 I'm making sure that the puppy is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=315.4s	315.4	 Enjoying the reinforcement, so I've also not used the extremely high level of reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=321.8s	321.8	 There's some dried chicken that he gets way too excited about so that might make him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=327.6s	327.6	 Stressed during this training so I have like a medium value treat, and then I'm just moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=333.2s	333.2	 Marking and reinforcing him for not going after my feet when they go by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=338.9s	338.9	 The other thing with border Collies is they can tend to want to hurt you as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 So as you see he's just kind of looking out calmly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 Expecting food rather than seeing me as some exciting hurting object good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=357.1s	357.1	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=361.9s	361.9	 Awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=376.7s	376.7	 Hi, hi, hey puppy good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=390.5s	390.5	 I almost did it too much there. I could see his little brain thinking about biting it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 So if you do something that is extremely hard for your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 You can go back and make it easier again so that you're not just starting to make the puppy aroused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=404.8s	404.8	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=406.1s	406.1	 Another reason that my puppy is so calm right now is that when I pet and touch and interact with him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=412.6s	412.6	 I don't do it in a very frantic excitable way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=416.2s	416.2	 Which most people do when they see puppies and this actually might make him mouthy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=421.2s	421.2	 But a lot of people will do this kind of stuff when they see puppies and go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=425.4s	425.4	 Oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=428.1s	428.1	 And then that makes the puppy very aroused and they also want to do something exciting back to you and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=434.9s	434.9	 They use their mouth. So that's just normal so we can teach puppies to be calm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=441.1s	441.1	 Around handling by being calm ourselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=444.7s	444.7	 So when you interact with your puppy do it in a respectful way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=449.3s	449.3	 Where you're just petting them calmly and they're it's really gonna help them feel calm and relaxed around you. Hey, Pupsy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=457.7s	457.7	 Good job. So if your puppy's really mouthy with just the slightest touch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=463.1s	463.1	 Or they want to go for your sleeve if it's like dangling right near their face as you're as you're petting them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=468.7s	468.7	 You can feed them and pet them at the same time to begin with like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=473.6s	473.6	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=474.6s	474.6	 And I have a whole video on how to go over this and teach your puppy not to bite your hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=480.5s	480.5	 but the more conditioning of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=483.1s	483.1	 Calmness around being handled the better because the wonderful thing about starting this early is that you can then use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=491.3s	491.3	 Handling to calm your puppy down. So if they're getting excited you can calmly pet them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=496.9s	496.9	 But if you've only made petting an exciting thing that makes them excited

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=507.1s	507.1	 Especially if you're restraining them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=508.7s	508.7	 I also have a video on teaching a puppy to be restrained because oftentimes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=515.1s	515.1	 that will get skipped in the training and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=518.2s	518.2	 so if you have a little puppy and they grow up into an adult and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=523.3s	523.3	 Someone has to restrain them at the vet that can be very frightening for an adult dog and it can possibly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=529.3s	529.3	 Mean that the dog might bite so you want to practice restraints as well with a puppy and I have a video on that too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=537.0s	537.0	 And I'll link those in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=539.4s	539.4	 Look at you being perfect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=541.3s	541.3	 No one would believe that you were very excitable and biting my hands just a few minutes earlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=547.9s	547.9	 A lot of trainers suggest having a leash on a puppy inside the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=552.7s	552.7	 My own way that I train is I don't like to have a leash on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=556.6s	556.6	 Because what can happen is that the puppy hits the end of the leash and gets used to pulling into that pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=563.1s	563.1	 So when I train leash walking I like to train right from the start that the puppy never pulls on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=568.7s	568.7	 And that's really hard if you have a leash on a lot of the time and your puppy is really bored about being with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=576.1s	576.1	 And wants to do other stuff. So I prefer this way of teaching the puppy how to behave when loose and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=584.1s	584.1	 Build their motivation to want to be around me rather than it being that they can't leave my side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=591.3s	591.3	 So that's that's how I like to train and usually once I've reinforced them as you'll see if I just ignore him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=598.6s	598.6	 He's gonna hang around me because this has been the most reinforcing place to be and then it's really easy to watch him when he's loose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=606.1s	606.1	 Sometimes if you have a leash and they're used to the concept of oh when I'm off leash I get to do stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=612.3s	612.3	 They're not gonna want to be near you as much when you've hooked the leash off because now they get to do these things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=617.2s	617.2	 They don't often get to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=619.7s	619.7	 so it can really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=622.6s	622.6	 Backfire sometimes where the leash makes the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=627.0s	627.0	 Disinterested in you because they're attached to you all the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=629.5s	629.5	 So when they're off leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=630.5s	630.5	 It's suddenly this wonderful opportunity to finally have choices and and make decisions in the environment and that's really reinforcing for animals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=638.7s	638.7	 So by just teaching them to make the choices that you like then everybody's happy and you have a very contented puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=645.3s	645.3	 Whose little brain is growing because they're busy doing stuff and having thoughts and getting to do what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=651.3s	651.3	 And deciding they don't want that toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=653.1s	653.1	 They want the other toy or maybe they want to put one toy on top of the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=657.5s	657.5	 Or run across the kitchen and then play with it on the mat and come back and lay in their dog bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=663.3s	663.3	 So all those little choices that they're making are helping them grow and also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=668.5s	668.5	 When the puppy's loose their body is going to be growing more normally because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=673.9s	673.9	 They're moving around more if a dog's on a leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=677.0s	677.0	 Their movement is restricted the same with a crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=680.6s	680.6	 So I suggest when leaving a puppy that you leave the puppy in a pen rather than a crate because then they can make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=686.8s	686.8	 more natural movement when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=689.8s	689.8	 Confined and they can make choices of whether to sleep or whether to move around and play with their toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=696.5s	696.5	 Hey pup pups, this is a lobster kitty. Oh, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=701.5s	701.5	 Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=703.9s	703.9	 Oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=704.9s	704.9	 She got my shirt. He got my shirt so I can say pup pups and then show him the toy that I want him to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=711.0s	711.0	 Yeah, that's right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=713.4s	713.4	 Here I happen to get a shot of him mouthing my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=716.7s	716.7	 The game plan is setting the environment up for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=719.6s	719.6	 So the puppy makes the correct choices and then when the puppy does mouth then interrupt and redirect to something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=726.2s	726.2	 Appropriate and the real important part is teaching the puppy what to do around moving hands and clothes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7lHcyoKJE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=147&pp=iAQB&t=733.4s	733.4	 Thank you so much for watching if you'd like to support my work
