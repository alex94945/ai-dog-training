https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=6.5s	6.5	 takes a step into the crate to get to the treats. After you click, throw the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=19.7s	19.7	 has eaten the treat but is still inside the crate. Continue clicking and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 treating the dog for staying inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=30.8s	30.8	 Step 2. Put a treat inside the crate and just before you release the dog to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=37.4s	37.4	 into the crate, say your cue, go crate, and click as the dog goes into the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=42.8s	42.8	 Then click for the dog staying inside the crate. You want to immediately add

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=52.3s	52.3	 To do this, say your release cue, pause, and then move and click your dog for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=59.2s	59.2	 coming out of the crate. You want to move after you say your release cue so the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=63.9s	63.9	 doesn't think that you moving is the release. A good sign that your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=67.8s	67.8	 loving the crate is when the dog offers going inside the crate again. Click and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=72.1s	72.1	 feed the dog for making a good choice. If your dog decides to come out of the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 Step 3. Now pretend to throw a treat inside the crate and give the dog the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 cue to go crate. Click as the dog goes into the crate even though there's no

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nQs2xyyDU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=483&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 it, the dog will get frustrated when you don't do it and won't want to stay
