https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Okay, lesson number one, have something that your dog doesn't mind standing on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 And if they're kind of okay with standing on it, you can actually build it so they like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 standing on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=12.8s	12.8	 So for her, a book works really well, but you can also use like a plastic foot stool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=17.7s	17.7	 or a basin upside down if they don't mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 If it's round, it's preferably better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=22.6s	22.6	 This is just building confidence with the object and teaching them that's where your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=26.5s	26.5	 front feet should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=29.1s	29.1	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=31.1s	31.1	 Another trick is throwing the treat away so that they have to re-orient the object, trying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=40.1s	40.1	 to find the object from just different directions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=45.9s	45.9	 And obviously Kegel already has played this game, so it should take, you know, that should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=50.3s	50.3	 be a lesson in itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=56.2s	56.2	 You can either throw the treats around or start feeding them as they get onto the book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 Okay, next step, have your dog on the object and a treat in hand so you can lure them onto
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 the object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 You can shape this, but it takes much longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=100.8s	100.8	 Here's the wonderful treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 I'm going to just move a little.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=104.9s	104.9	 And when I see her adjust, she knows this game too, so it looks really easy, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=109.6s	109.6	 not that easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=111.4s	111.4	 You're holding the treat and you move and you're waiting for her back legs to move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=115.6s	115.6	 So just take one step, click a side step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=118.3s	118.3	 The dog is kind of going like this, like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 So some people will use a technique of, wait, of holding the treat like this and then walking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=131.6s	131.6	 into the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=132.6s	132.6	 So they're kind of having to bend around the body to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 You're not actually adding pressure, you're just creating a barrier that they have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=142.6s	142.6	 kind of turn around to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 You can see what I'm saying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=149.6s	149.6	 So, at first, just one step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 You want to click each step they take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=155.6s	155.6	 Any little foot movement, any little stutter in the back feet, because some dogs will find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 it really hard to do, especially if they're a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 They have never used those muscles before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 So you're just clicking steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=170.6s	170.6	 After your dog's pretty good at that, go the other way, just so that their muscles don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 get unbalanced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=181.6s	181.6	 One hand holds the treat, the other hand is an obstacle for the dog to have to look around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 By pulling the treat behind your hand, you can kind of get them to swing around, swing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=191.6s	191.6	 around your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 Once you've got that, practice holding the treat and saying yes for the dog to line up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 with you in the front position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=205.6s	205.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 Go both ways at first if you want to have a dog that can do the exercises on both sides
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=215.6s	215.6	 of your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=216.6s	216.6	 A finish on this side, a finish on that side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=218.6s	218.6	 Otherwise if you work on one too long, they'll be best at doing that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=227.6s	227.6	 I'm not saying yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=229.6s	229.6	 So at first you would want to yes just for that one step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 And the reason I'm not clicking is because it's too close to her ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=239.6s	239.6	 Okay, so the next step is holding the food and seeing how many steps you can get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=247.6s	247.6	 A first goal would be a whole circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 And when you stop, you want to wait until your dog winds up perfectly with you if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 are interested in doing fronts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=265.6s	265.6	 Next step, pretend to put treats into your hand and then move as if there's a lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 Surprise, no treat, but you still get one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=276.6s	276.6	 So they get used to targeting your hand even though there's no treat in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=282.6s	282.6	 If your dog figures you out, then pretend to get another treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=288.6s	288.6	 Try and make it as obvious that there's a treat actually in there because they might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=292.6s	292.6	 just give up on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=294.6s	294.6	 Go both ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 Pretend to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=300.6s	300.6	 Oh, look at this lovely treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=302.6s	302.6	 Surprise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 Surprise, no treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=310.6s	310.6	 My click was a little late then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=311.6s	311.6	 Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=316.6s	316.6	 Okay, so once your dog's a master of turning, then stand next to them with a treat in front.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=321.6s	321.6	 Treat in front means keep your body lined up with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=324.6s	324.6	 Treat in front means keep your body lined up with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=330.6s	330.6	 And as you can see, she's pivoting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=335.6s	335.6	 This is a 360 left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=340.6s	340.6	 And now you want to feed out the treat very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=343.6s	343.6	 So pretend you have the treat and turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 Pretend to have the treat, turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=350.6s	350.6	 You can even take away the hand and try and wait your dog out to work with you if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=356.6s	356.6	 don't want to have your hand here cueing them to turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=362.6s	362.6	 Or put your hand wherever it's going to be when you do your attention healing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=371.6s	371.6	 Okay, so once you've done that side, practice on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=376.6s	376.6	 And I would.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=377.6s	377.6	 I mean, I know you're not going to use it, but why not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=380.6s	380.6	 If you get two dogs, then you can have one on either side looking a little spiffy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=392.6s	392.6	 Another exercise is having the dog on the right side, pulling them to the front where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 you stand behind the book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=399.6s	399.6	 Stand to the left of the book and pull them to the left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=404.6s	404.6	 All these exercises are building their muscle memory of how to move with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=410.6s	410.6	 And of course, I think compulsion, you would grab their collar and swing on either side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=418.6s	418.6	 But this way the dog is really enjoying it and loves to turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=422.6s	422.6	 The turns just reinforce the healing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=426.6s	426.6	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=429.6s	429.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=433.6s	433.6	 My click was a little late.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=434.6s	434.6	 I clicked her when she was standing still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=436.6s	436.6	 You want to click your dog as they're doing the movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=440.6s	440.6	 You're saying that movement is what I want, not standing still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=444.6s	444.6	 Even though they're in the right place, you want to say moving into that place is what I want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=453.6s	453.6	 So practice with the book and then remove the book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=459.6s	459.6	 So she's knowing that this is the spot that we've been doing the exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=464.6s	464.6	 So now I can either do the front exercise with her in front, finding front again, or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=471.6s	471.6	 I can work on the side exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjegRkLdvuA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=576&pp=iAQB&t=549.6s	549.6	 Music
