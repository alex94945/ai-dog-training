https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 One of the first things to teach your new dog before you start training is not to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=4.7s	4.7	 what this dog is doing right here, which is mugging my hand, trying to get the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=9.1s	9.1	 out on her own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 I want her to learn that the way that she gets treats is offering behaviors, especially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=15.8s	15.8	 behaviors that I've reinforced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 So the moment that Mia backs away from the hand, I'm going to click and reinforce her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=25.4s	25.4	 The next step is reinforcing her for staying back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 A lot of trainers make the mistake of letting the dog mug the hand and then back off, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 then you get a behavior chain of the dog messing with your hand and backing away, messing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=37.6s	37.6	 your hand and backing away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=39.5s	39.5	 So what you want to do is really reinforce the absence of the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 So the dog is staying back and remaining calm while there's food in your hand or while you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=48.8s	48.8	 reaching into your bait bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=51.9s	51.9	 You're good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 Once you've got a grate leaving the hand, which is no mugging, you can get eye contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmxMtIr1n84&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=429&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 instead of clicking your dog for staring at your hand.
