https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=4.6s	4.6	 Clickers are loud, especially these box clickers, and if you just click them in front of your dog, you're going to frighten your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=10.2s	10.2	 So you need to muffle it. I like to use a piece of poster tack and just stick it onto the dimple of the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=17.1s	17.1	 That way, it's not as loud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 Charging the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 The first step to clicker training after muffling your clicker is to charge your clicker, or build meaning to the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=28.1s	28.1	 Otherwise, the dog doesn't really know what it means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=31.1s	31.1	 So to do that, you're going to click, pause, feed your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 If you click and feed your dog a treat at the same time, you're not teaching the dog the click means the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=41.6s	41.6	 They're just seeing your hand moving is the sign that they're going to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=45.6s	45.6	 So to build meaning to the clicker, it has to come first before the food comes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 So you don't want to also move your hand as you click, like a remote control, or the dog is seeing this as the sign that a treat is coming, and not specifically the noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=59.6s	59.6	 In a non-distracting environment that your dog is comfortable in, click, pause, and feed your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=66.6s	66.6	 You can either feed them to their mouth or put the treat on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=69.6s	69.6	 Repeat this ten times. If your dog is not alerting to the clicker after ten to twenty repetitions, it could mean that the treat you're using is not reinforcing enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 Once you have conditioned the clicker, you can start to reinforce and train the behaviors that you like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 This puppy is being reinforced for sitting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=90.7s	90.7	 If you've muffled your clicker, it's okay to click near your dog's head, because it's not loud, it doesn't hurt their ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJd3XceMxN0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=430&pp=iAQB&t=96.7s	96.7	 But if this piece of poster tack wasn't on there, that would be extremely painful to splash his ears to have any clicking near it.
