https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=17.3s	17.3	 talking about the magicalness and amazingness and extreme intelligence of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=22.6s	22.6	 little puppies. Here's footage of my Bordicali halo two days after I got him

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 A lot of times people think that the puppy is stubborn or just doesn't want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 to learn or they're not smart but the thing is is that if you go and train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 them to do the same behavior repetitively like sitting down and come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 and stay and all that, what can happen is that the puppy can start to predict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=62.4s	62.4	 that when you have treats in a clicker it's all about to sit and then it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=66.6s	66.6	 really hard to get other behaviors. So what I like to teach puppies is the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=71.9s	71.9	 concept of learning new behaviors and the concept of offering among other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 things. So I will link a video on how to teach your puppy to follow a lure where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 they're thinking and not just trying to eat the treat out of your hand to learn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=87.5s	87.5	 behaviors but also I like to teach the puppies offering. So offering behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=94.7s	94.7	 like four feet up on a platform first taught by luring, two feet on a platform

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=114.8s	114.8	 your puppy to offer. Going through a tunnel, good job, so that's a fun game to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=123.2s	123.2	 teach your puppy to offer. He said I would like to stay in the tunnel like a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=141.4s	141.4	 small dog it's not such a big deal to train it first. I really like teaching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 footwork because I do canine freestyle and I really obsess over nail trimming

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 want to train that first because you might get a dog that paws you. For really

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=176.7s	176.7	 behavior to teach them to offer before they understand the concept of only

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 positions which is really good for their body. The goal of this exercise is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=202.5s	202.5	 teaching the puppy to follow a lure to do different behaviors as well as how to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=216.5s	216.5	 on how to train the position changes as behaviors that you then add cues to and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuoOTuO6acE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=116&pp=iAQB&t=236.3s	236.3	 you that's going to be very helpful for teaching the dog the concept of they
