https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 are behaviors that are opposite from each other and if you don't find the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 perfect balance of reinforcement and proofing of the two behaviors, one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=12.8s	12.8	 behavior can become really strong and the dog can be really good at it but the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 other one can start to falter and the dog is going to not be as good at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=20.1s	20.1	 For example, your dog could be really good at tugging but not so good at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=23.5s	23.5	 letting go or really good at dropping but not really that enthusiastic about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 So this is a game that I play with wish to proof the drop and the get it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 also create variety in the training which can really build the behaviors to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 tuggy, tuggy and then I'm gonna say drop, twirl, get it. And basically I'm asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=49.7s	49.7	 her for a behavior that's opposite to tugging which is turning in the opposite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 direction and once she's figured out that if she the faster she turns the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 more likely she's gonna get to tug again. Ready? Drop, twirl, get it. Drop, spin, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=66.8s	66.8	 Drop, twirl, get it. You can also add pauses so the dog never knows when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=73.8s	73.8	 you're gonna say get it predictably or when you're gonna say drop. Drop, ready, go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 Go legs, get it. Drop legs, get it. Drop, go around, go around. If they get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=88.9s	88.9	 behavior wrong you can simply lure the dog so she went the wrong direction I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=92.3s	92.3	 just gonna lure her around this way. Get it. Drop, go circle, get it. Drop, go circle, go

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cbaGgTCH0U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=312&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 Get it. Drop, twirl, get it. Good girl. Another thing that I have is a marker word that
