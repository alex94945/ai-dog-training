https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody today, I'm going to be talking about how to teach your puppy not to mouth or bite at your clothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=6.4s	6.4	 accessories or your hair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=8.6s	8.6	 puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 What I've already worked on with this pup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 I've only had him a few days is working on a calm settle for food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=16.2s	16.2	 Which he's doing right now so I can talk to you now naturally when I train dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 I never want to let them rehearse the undesirable behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 So in my videos you'll never see the dogs doing the things that they're not supposed to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=30.5s	30.5	 I only show you the small approximations of how to train the dog what you do want them to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 But in this case because I get a lot of requests of people saying hey, how come you're never using untrained dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=42.7s	42.7	 It's because when you train with positive reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 It always looks like the dog is already trained because you're breaking the steps up small enough that the dog can succeed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=52.2s	52.2	 Every step of the way so this puppy has never had any training with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=56.7s	56.7	 Mouthing and biting and I will show you that my puppy does mouth and bite at clothing when it moves around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=63.6s	63.6	 But it's not very good training to do this on this rare occasion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 I will show the dog rehearsing the undesirable behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 This is because the behavior of tugging is one I do want for when playing with tug toys in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=76.6s	76.6	 Also showing this specific undesirable behavior is not stressful for this dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=81.5s	81.5	 Seeing what the dog does in a situation before training actually makes the dog more likely to do those behaviors in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=89.5s	89.5	 Instead a smarter training plan is training in small easily achievable steps where the dog doesn't even have a thought to do the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=97.8s	97.8	 Undesirable behavior again as you can see this is a normal puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=102.1s	102.1	 Puppies naturally want to grab at anything that moves fast or is dangling like a dress or your hair or some jewelry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=109.6s	109.6	 Or this dishcloth or a sweater sleeve as you're putting it on so this is a normal puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 But you'll see during the training the puppy is not going to be doing this type of behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=121.7s	121.7	 The point of this exercise is to teach the puppy that when things are dangling around it means to ignore them and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=128.6s	128.6	 You can still play tug with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 But it's really important to put that on a verbal cue like get it and always say get it before you offer your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 A toy to tug on so they don't get the wrong idea that anything that's dangling in their face is fair game to be tugged on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 In this exercise you can either use a clicker or a verbal marker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 So you can either click and then feed a treat or I have a nice calm marker good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 That means I'm gonna slowly deliver the treat to the puppy like that the game is pretty simple you start off with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 Distractions that are very easy for the puppy to ignore so with this sweater for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=167.1s	167.1	 If the puppy is over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=169.1s	169.1	 Settling or you could have your puppy on a leash and you could have a helper the helper is just going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 Show the sweater and move it slowly and as you move it you mark and then feed a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 So the puppy is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 Associating that when the sweater moves and they stay still they get a click and a treat and basically you're training the puppy to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=190.2s	190.2	 Nothing when they see this happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=192.7s	192.7	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=195.7s	195.7	 When your puppy is having success you can start to make things more exciting so I'm gonna move the sweater past the puppy like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 Good job, I'm gonna dangle my sleeve good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=220.4s	220.4	 Once your puppy has mastered settling with the distractions you can now practice when you and your puppy are standing up and moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=227.3s	227.3	 Which is harder for most puppies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=229.3s	229.3	 So you'll need to go back to marking the moment the distraction happens at first to set your puppy up for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=238.5s	238.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=245.4s	245.4	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 Good job good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=261.5s	261.5	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=263.5s	263.5	 When your puppy looks calm and can easily ignore the distraction you can increase how long you make the distraction happen before you mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 You can also increase the difficulty of the distraction most puppies find fast erratic movement harder to resist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=278.9s	278.9	 Than slow predictable movement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=284.6s	284.6	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=287.7s	287.7	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=288.8s	288.8	 If you have a puppy that's extremely excited about grabbing moving things you can feed the treat as you move the thing at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=296.5s	296.5	 So I'm moving this thing and feeding the puppy like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=300.8s	300.8	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=302.9s	302.9	 And now I'm going to do the leash first and then mark and feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=308.3s	308.3	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=314.8s	314.8	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=317.8s	317.8	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=320.1s	320.1	 If your puppy were to grab onto whatever it is that you're working with put a high-value treat to your dog's nose and then start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=326.8s	326.8	 Over by making it much less arousing good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=330.7s	330.7	 Also, I have a video on how to train the cue drop so that you can teach your puppy to let go of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=336.7s	336.7	 That they start to pick up or they're tugging on you can also use a kissy noise or the recall if you see your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=343.6s	343.6	 Going over to someone else to pull on their shoelaces or to get their clothing. You can make your kissy noise attention noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=350.9s	350.9	 Or call your puppy to you so that your puppy isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=355.0s	355.0	 practicing that behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 When you see your puppy get interested in something like someone's shuffling feet or shoelaces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=362.4s	362.4	 Interrupt your puppy and redirect him to something you do want him to be doing like playing with his toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=368.0s	368.0	 Then make a mental note to work on that specific distraction in a training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=380.9s	380.9	 Here's a list of the steps step one mark as the distraction happens step two
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 Mark after the distraction begins step three add more time before you mark step four add
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=394.4s	394.4	 difficulty and variety to the training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 For the most successful training you want to work on the distractions before the puppy is exposed to them in real life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=405.9s	405.9	 for example

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=227&pp=iAQB&t=424.8s	424.8	 Ted Jack because of him and my other sponsors
