https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone, I'm filming another one of my training sessions with my nine week old puppy here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 and just before I was gonna turn the camera on I was gonna put my shoes on and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=9.9s	9.9	 because I told you this puppy likes to bite on stuff like my hands and my clothes and stuff like that and no one believes me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=16.2s	16.2	 because you know when I'm training I'm trying to prevent that the biting from happening. So I was gonna put my shoes on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 and basically if I didn't do anything the puppy would go and bite my shoes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 So I suggest where you keep your shoes you have some or your clothes you have some treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=35.1s	35.1	 or a chew to give the puppy and then put the clothes or shoes on when you're busy and then in training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=41.9s	41.9	 you can work on teaching the puppy not to bite clothes and hands like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 I have a tutorial on how to do that and I'll link that in the description below but just a management technique is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 standing behind the barrier a barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 I've even after getting this puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=58.6s	58.6	 I put my shoes on sitting on the bath with my feet in the bath dry bathtub
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=63.6s	63.6	 just to prevent the puppy seeing me putting my shoes on because I was in a rush and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 I didn't want him to look at my shoes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=71.6s	71.6	 So what you do is you sprinkle a couple of treats and this is just managing the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=77.7s	77.7	 So you can put your shoes on without the dog rehearsing going for the laces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 So in training sessions you can reinforce the dog for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=88.2s	88.2	 ignoring and leaving your shoes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=90.2s	90.2	 but when you're doing something like you have to do something and you don't have time for training you can use management but if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=97.4s	97.4	 only use management as you can imagine if there are no treats the puppy might just think to go back to what he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 He would naturally want to do which is go for your shoes. Oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 Hi and splash here. She has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=111.5s	111.5	 Bladder cancer so she gets to do whatever she wants to do in her last days, don't you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 So if you want to interrupt my videos, that's perfectly fine. You get reinforced for that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 So you can lay there and eat puppy kibble. Why not just a couple?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 There you go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=131.5s	131.5	 You're doing so good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 Okay, so the first exercise that I wanted to work on with this little guy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=139.7s	139.7	 Yesterday we were doing eye contact and I was using some really high-value treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 And so today I'm giving him a couple of treats there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=147.9s	147.9	 Because it's been it's it's like the middle of the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 So he had his breakfast and he had a couple treats for some other stuff, but he's kind of hungry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 So I'm giving him a couple to make sure he's not too hungry when I do the exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 Because yesterday I had really high-value treats and it was super hard for him to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=167.7s	167.7	 To give me attention away from the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=170.5s	170.5	 So if you'll remember or I'll link the video below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 But I did a training session where I was asking him for eye contact with the distraction of holding the treats like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 Good job. And then when I started to move the treats he had an he found it super hard to look away from them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=188.3s	188.3	 So this is just his kibble now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=191.5s	191.5	 And you can see that it's much easier if you compare the footage from the previous training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=197.2s	197.2	 He can look away from the kibble easily. In fact, he looked away from one that was between his paws there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=203.1s	203.1	 And you can see he's settling which is lovely. I love that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 Yeah, it's awesome, especially because I just put my shoes on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=211.1s	211.1	 Okay, so here we go again. I'm gonna hold the treats out make the kissy noise. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=217.9s	217.9	 mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=222.3s	222.3	 Good and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 Add some duration so before when I was using the high-value treats that was adding criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=231.5s	231.5	 It was harder because the treats were more interesting to the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=234.9s	234.9	 So now that I'm using the low-value treats I can add duration to the eye contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 Good job, so I can talk to him good mark and then reinforce him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=245.9s	245.9	 So there I can get way more duration in the eye contact and work on the duration of the low value and work on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=253.6s	253.6	 Just the concept of working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=256.2s	256.2	 looking away from novelty food when using the high-value treats and then start to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 Generalize so he can do that with any sort of treats. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 So now I'm gonna add the movement that he was struggling with yesterday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=269.3s	269.3	 So I'm gonna move my hands like this and I can either just keep moving them and wait till he forgets them by moving them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=276.5s	276.5	 repetitively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=277.5s	277.5	 Like that and then click him offering me eye contact or I can make my kissy noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=284.5s	284.5	 Or other interesting noises to get him to look up at me like that good job good boy, and this is going really well yay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=295.2s	295.2	 Awesome so that was super easy for him. He said that's easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=298.5s	298.5	 So now when I use the high-value treats I can start off by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 First having them behind my back and then here and then maybe a little bit of movement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 But definitely not lots of duration with the eye contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 Just clicking the moment that he looks away from whatever I have in my hands like that good boy, so now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=319.4s	319.4	 Because it's been a few days. I'm gonna brush him with a brush because we haven't done that in a few days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 It's got some of my other dogs hair in it of course your hair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=333.6s	333.6	 Okay, so I'm just gonna feed him as I brush it first good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=340.6s	340.6	 And then brush him a little bit and then feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=346.8s	346.8	 Good and there he looked at the brush so I would go back to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=351.2s	351.2	 Feeding him or holding the treat out like this good before giving it to him good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=363.3s	363.3	 Good good job this part's all tangled on your legs good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=373.5s	373.5	 I'd like you to stand up get it good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=380.8s	380.8	 So I'm gonna feed him a treat on these tangly bits because most likely a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=385.7s	385.7	 puppy would turn around if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=388.1s	388.1	 Pulling on his little nuts. He's got some fuzzy butt hair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=393.2s	393.2	 Good job, okay, so that was good and now we're gonna refresh the Dremel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 Because I love trimming my dog's nails and making sure they're short
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=402.7s	402.7	 So here's the Dremel and we worked on it before so I'm gonna throw the treat away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=407.6s	407.6	 So he's far away from me when I make the noise to begin with so it doesn't startle him go get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=415.1s	415.1	 You stay there boo-boo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=417.2s	417.2	 Right here there you go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=420.2s	420.2	 So after he's done with his treat the Dremel noise yay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=423.3s	423.3	 And you can see he's starting to have a conditioned response to the sound of the Dremel now in between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=428.8s	428.8	 the training sessions of the Dremel when he's sleepy or he's chewing on a toy or a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=435.5s	435.5	 Chewstick I cut some of his nails using a human nail clipper because he's a puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=441.2s	441.2	 And I'm just gonna let the Dremel run over here. He was like why did you do that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=445.7s	445.7	 So I'm gonna let it run and then I'm gonna lift his feet good and feed a treat like that good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=453.1s	453.1	 Awesome good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=457.1s	457.1	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=464.2s	464.2	 See I can get a better angle on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=466.2s	466.2	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=474.8s	474.8	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=480.2s	480.2	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=482.7s	482.7	 And what I'm doing here is letting him eat food and also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=488.5s	488.5	 Trimming his nails so you saw I got in a nail at that point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=492.5s	492.5	 And then I could just that could be good enough for the first session because he's never had his nails Dremel before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=499.1s	499.1	 So a lot of positive reinforcement literature will say first do the stimulus or whatever you want to condition first and then give the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=506.9s	506.9	 but sometimes if it's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=511.2s	511.2	 Uncomfortable or weird to the dog if you do it first they might not like it and then it's hard to undo that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=517.3s	517.3	 so by sprinkling a whole bunch of treats and then just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=521.6s	521.6	 Habituating the dog to the experience while they're busy with something else then when the treats are gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=527.8s	527.8	 It's gonna be less weird because it's already happened to them while they were a little bit distracted so now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=534.5s	534.5	 I'm gonna see if I can do his little nail while he's not distracted and you can see that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=541.5s	541.5	 Good his nose is like right in where the Dremel is so it's hi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=546.3s	546.3	 So it's really helpful if you have a helper when you first trim your dog's nails because as you make a little trim
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=552.4s	552.4	 Someone else can feed the dog or if you're working alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=556.1s	556.1	 You can have the treats on your leg like this so the dog is waiting or on the ground waiting for these treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=562.9s	562.9	 Good, and then you can go and get a treat like that good job boo-boo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=566.4s	566.4	 You want to me to do your nails?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=568.6s	568.6	 Another thing is if your other dogs are really good with their their nails being trimmed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=573.1s	573.1	 You can get your dog used to the sound of the Dremel by having the other dog have their nails trimmed good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=580.1s	580.1	 What do you think of that that was weird?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=582.6s	582.6	 That was weird. It smells huh?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=585.4s	585.4	 Whoo, it smells a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=588.5s	588.5	 Smells like nails
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=593.2s	593.2	 Good job, let's get it do it again. Are you ready? Here we go. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=597.8s	597.8	 Good job. I did his her nails
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=601.1s	601.1	 Gosh, I'm getting the genders all mixed up he and she here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=606.9s	606.9	 Let's do some more nail on splash her ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=611.9s	611.9	 Sorry splash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=615.9s	615.9	 Usually I have splash upside down to do her nails good job and this paw over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=622.1s	622.1	 Oh, that was too much. He's gone over here to check out my treat bag, but that's not a bad sign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=628.4s	628.4	 I thought I thought he was a little bit worried at first when I did her one nail and it you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=633.3s	633.3	 The dust from the nail smells weird good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=637.2s	637.2	 Okay, so we did some of the nail the conditioning to the Dremel which I'm very happy about and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=645.1s	645.1	 What else can we work on I had planned on just doing these two things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=649.1s	649.1	 But I'm gonna work on paws up teaching him to put his paws up on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=654.2s	654.2	 That little platform that we worked on when I did that little obstacle course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=659.4s	659.4	 Having the puppy walk over different surfaces, but I that was the first time he did paws up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=664.3s	664.3	 So I want to get him offering paws up when he sees the platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=669.0s	669.0	 Okay, so I'm gonna refresh by putting this down and then luring him onto the platform and then oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=675.9s	675.9	 I don't know where I put my clicker and then marking and reinforcing him for staying on there with his feet still good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=683.3s	683.3	 And now I'm gonna say free and release him. I got my clicker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=687.5s	687.5	 I actually really like to use the clicker for this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=691.1s	691.1	 So when the dog is offering something specific, I really like to use the clicker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=696.4s	696.4	 So first I'm gonna go back to luring him to put his feet up like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=700.6s	700.6	 Mark and reinforce and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=703.0s	703.0	 Then I'm gonna release him free and give him a treat over there. And then now I'm gonna stand between the box and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=710.8s	710.8	 Him and hopefully that will give him the idea to put his feet up now if I was over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=715.9s	715.9	 He would be less likely to put his feet up and also if he was over here and the box with behind him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=722.8s	722.8	 He would be less likely to initiate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=725.8s	725.8	 Putting his feet up there. He walked towards it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=728.3s	728.3	 So I'm gonna reinforce him and then just feed him with his feet up like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=732.7s	732.7	 So say for example, you were free shaping a dog to do something and they walk towards the box
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=738.5s	738.5	 You could mark and then just simply feed him for putting his feet up and that's gonna speed up your training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=744.7s	744.7	 Especially if you have a small dog that can't eat very much food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=748.0s	748.0	 So you can train more stuff by being efficient by where you deliver the reinforcement. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=754.6s	754.6	 you're basically giving them little hints and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=757.9s	757.9	 Reinforcing that position. Good job free and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=762.5s	762.5	 As I said, I really like to reinforce them for staying and then understanding the concept of a release
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=769.3s	769.3	 Because it makes training duration behaviors like stays
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=773.7s	773.7	 really easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=775.6s	775.6	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=783.2s	783.2	 Awesome I could also ask for some eye contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=787.5s	787.5	 Awesome, and now I'm gonna release him free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=790.6s	790.6	 And see if he might think to go up on that box and I can point at it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=796.3s	796.3	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=798.1s	798.1	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=800.1s	800.1	 Awesome. So now free I kind of bet that he might put his feet up so I can say go pause up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=807.0s	807.0	 Which is my cue for my other dogs mark and reinforce. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=813.6s	813.6	 Add a little bit of duration of staying up there so that the picture isn't too similar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=818.7s	818.7	 Release him free awesome. And now I'm gonna make it super easy and say go pause up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=825.1s	825.1	 Awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=826.4s	826.4	 Good job, and then we'll end that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=829.4s	829.4	 Exercise now because that was really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DELcQqkHQg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=139&pp=iAQB&t=833.0s	833.0	 Thank you so much for watching if you'd like to support my work
