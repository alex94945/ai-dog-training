https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody! This video is on the topic of when and how to stop clicking when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 training a behavior using a clicker. This information also applies to when you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=11.6s	11.6	 training your dog with a verbal marker such as good or yes that's always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=16.5s	16.5	 followed by a treat. Basically, you can stop clicking or using your verbal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=21.4s	21.4	 marker when the dog is reliably offering a behavior after you say a cue. For
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=26.8s	26.8	 example, if you say sit and your dog sits within one to three seconds reliably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 after you say the cue, you can stop clicking. I'm going to do a little demo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=36.5s	36.5	 of how to remove the clicker or the marker word from the training scenario
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 and build those behaviors so that you can use them in real life, but I also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 want to mention that once you've trained a behavior such as a down stay and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=52.2s	52.2	 dog understands the concept of getting into the position and staying in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=56.8s	56.8	 position until they hear the release cue, you can then utilize the clicker if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=61.9s	61.9	 you're adding criteria to that behavior. So for example, your dog understands the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=67.1s	67.1	 concept of a down stay in the living room, but when you add distance and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=71.9s	71.9	 distractions you could go back and utilize the clicker or your marker word
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 when training, adding criteria to your training or proofing the behavior with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 distractions. Marking and reinforcing behaviors build strong behaviors, however
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=89.3s	89.3	 if you're too predictable about when you click and feed the treat and you stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=95.4s	95.4	 at the same level of criteria for too long, it becomes difficult to stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=100.6s	100.6	 clicking and giving treats. This is because, for example, if you asked your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 dog to sit, clicked and treated, the millisecond your dog's butt hits the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 ground every single time and you keep repeating that, you can imagine that when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 the dog sits and they hear nothing and get nothing, they're going to be confused
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=118.8s	118.8	 and sometimes even frustrated and not understand why they didn't get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=124.1s	124.1	 reinforced for the behavior that has predicted reinforcement every single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 time. For example, if you put money into a soda machine every single time you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=134.3s	134.3	 a soda and then suddenly you put your money in, you do your behavior and you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 nothing back, it can be very confusing. So I'm going to show you how you can stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 clicking and using treats and move on to a variable ratio of reinforcement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=148.2s	148.2	 meaning that the dog is doing multiple behaviors for reinforcement without the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 dog being confused and frustrated. So the way that I like to teach puppies in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 puppy class to prevent this from happening is teach the dog to offer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=164.8s	164.8	 multiple behaviors for a treat lure. So basically you're training your dog to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=170.5s	170.5	 listen to verbal cues such as down, but to teach the dog the concept that every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 behavior is not always going to equal a click and a treat, you can start luring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=183.4s	183.4	 your dog and asking for multiple behaviors before they get the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=187.2s	187.2	 reinforcement while the criteria is lowered because they're following a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=192.1s	192.1	 Now if you were training a new dog or young puppy and you asked for multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 behaviors when they're just learning all the new behaviors, the dogs are going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 start making errors. So in order to teach the dog that he can do multiple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=206.1s	206.1	 behaviors without hearing a click or a marker, you can make it easier by using a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=211.2s	211.2	 treat lure. Are you ready? So an example of this is you don't even need to use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=216.7s	216.7	 the clicker and you could practice luring the dog around with the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=220.8s	220.8	 for duration. Good. Or leg weaves where the dog is weaving your legs like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=230.7s	230.7	 or position changes where the dog is going from a sit into the down position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=236.4s	236.4	 and back to the sit spinning in a circle to the left, spinning in the circle to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=241.3s	241.3	 the right and the dog is not hearing a click and getting a treat after every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=246.4s	246.4	 single behavior. So when you start to fade the clicker and not click for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 everything, the dog isn't going to be suddenly shocked that the picture has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=255.4s	255.4	 changed. When training a maintained behavior like a sit-stay, you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=259.9s	259.9	 make sure you're not always marking the moment the dog gets into the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 and then adding the duration because it's going to be really confusing to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=268.9s	268.9	 dog when you stop clicking and reinforcing that moment they get into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=273.3s	273.3	 the position and what can happen is the dog can start to offer other behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=276.9s	276.9	 or simply get up and move towards you and go, hey what just happened? You usually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=281.2s	281.2	 click immediately as I get into the position. The following footage is a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 to do something and they want to do it even if you don't have treats or toys or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=300.4s	300.4	 they don't want treats or toys because you can give them access to the things

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=309.8s	309.8	 because as you can imagine, some dogs don't want to eat treats all day long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 so if they see another dog at the park and they want to say hi and you ask your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=320.3s	320.3	 dog to sit, your dog is going to say I don't really feel like eating a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=324.1s	324.1	 right now, I'd rather play with that dog. So the game that I'm going to show you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=328.1s	328.1	 is the way that you can train your dog in little approximations that when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=334.1s	334.1	 ask him to do something it's always in his best interest and he gains access to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=349.6s	349.6	 your dog that is oftentimes overlooked in dog training classes and that is to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=368.7s	368.7	 are some dogs that will listen but if you have a dog that doesn't listen when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 you don't have treats this is the tutorial for you. It's a very simple game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 to begin with. You simply need to have a plate with some low value treats on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=381.8s	381.8	 like this kibble and then you need to have your dog in a leash and harness and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=385.6s	385.6	 put the treats out of reach of your dog. Now some dogs if you ask them to do a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=391.0s	391.0	 behavior for you they're most likely not going to do it because they want the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=394.7s	394.7	 treats on that plate. So I suggest going back to basics and using a higher value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=400.2s	400.2	 treat to lure your dog so you can ask for any behavior you want but choose

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=408.6s	408.6	 say sit and then I'm going to lure my dog. If it's difficult for my dog I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V80JVAibXLQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=194&pp=iAQB&t=413.0s	413.0	 going to click and treat or say yes and treat and then I'm going to give her a
