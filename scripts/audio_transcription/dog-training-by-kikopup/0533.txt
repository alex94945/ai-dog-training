https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=4.0s	4.0	 First you can start off by having your dog look at the harness, click and treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 Put a treat on the harness and click the dog for eating the treat off of the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 Now click your dog for sniffing the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 It's very likely to happen because the treat was sitting on top of the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 If your dog knows, knows targeting, you can ask him to target the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 If your dog doesn't know the cue touch, simply continue clicking your dog for sniffing the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 Click or say yep for touching the dog on the areas of the body that the harness will touch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 Touch the dog, say yep, then feed the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 Most dogs that don't like wearing a harness usually have the underlying issue that their body is very sensitive to being touched.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 So you want to work a couple of weeks on even just touching your dog with your hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 If your dog ever backs away or tries to nip you, that shows you you're going too fast and you need to go back a step and make the touching less intrusive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 Click or say yep for touching the dog gently with the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 Touch the dog with the harness and click or say yep as the harness touches their body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 As you can see in this footage, my dog really doesn't like being touched with the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 He's very sensitive to being touched.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 Open and close the harness buckle and feed the dog as if the buckle was the sound of a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 This conditions the dog to love every aspect of the harness, even the noise of the harness closing around him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 Move the harness towards the dog and feed the dog through the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 You'll be marking by saying yep or clicking as the dog maintains his position and doesn't back away from the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 If you have a dog that's highly fearful of their harness, you can walk them on their collar while you spend a couple of days working on them loving their harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 Don't forget to say yep or click for removing the harness as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 Here you can see my puppy is trying to get the treat without having to put his head through the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 I'm simply going to wait him out and see if he thinks to try the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 He's going to try spin, he tried appeasement licking, he tried sitting, he's going to try and get the treat without putting his head through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 He's learning the only thing that works is to put his head through the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 If you don't like luring with food, you can always use the touch cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Simply position your fingers in the opening of the harness as though they were a lure and ask your dog to touch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 The final result.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 This is my puppy after three sessions of a couple of minutes of conditioning him to the harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 His emotional response to the harness has changed completely and he'll even offer putting his nose through the opening of the harness so that I can easily put it on him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Now because my puppy is so sensitive to being touched, I'm also working on a lot of handling with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 This may seem like a lot of work just to get a dog to like putting a harness on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 But you will find that handling exercises and working on body sensitivity exercises will actually contribute to your dog having a wonderful temperament when being handled and touched in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 Feeling insecure about being handled is one of the main reasons that dogs bite people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 Make sure when you do these exercises that you don't trap the dog in a corner or have them on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 They should feel like it's their choice and that they can escape if they need to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 Making a dog feel trapped could cause them to be able to get away from the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 Making a dog feel trapped could cause them to bite but also make your conditioning efforts pointless or have their reverse effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 Make sure to muffle the clicker with a piece of poster tack or lots of layers of tape when working with the clicker near your dog's ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwAeuBDEiQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=534&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 You can also use a marker word like, yep, instead of the clicker when you're doing handling exercises or you can get a friend to click for you.
