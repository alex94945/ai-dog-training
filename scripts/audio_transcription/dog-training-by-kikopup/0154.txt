https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, this is just a quick tutorial on how to train your little dog to jump into your arms on a verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=6.8s	6.8	 I'm going to be training Epic to do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=10.2s	10.2	 because I really like to train little dogs this behavior as a safety behavior for an emergency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=15.8s	15.8	 Say when the dog is loose or you see something like a coyote coming out of the bushes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 you can cue your little dog to jump into your arms and pick them up because most of the time when we're scared or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 worried we come at our little dogs in a different way than they're used to which is in a panic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=32.1s	32.1	 running at them to grab them and guess what they do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=34.5s	34.5	 They they're scared and they run away because they've never seen you act that way and you're like a tall giant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 So the best thing to do in my situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 with my other little dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 I have asked them to jump in my into my arms and then I can turn my back on say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 it's an approaching dog or whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=52.6s	52.6	 rather than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=55.3s	55.3	 rather than see what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=57.6s	57.6	 Okay, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=59.5s	59.5	 the first step is just getting used the dog getting used to being on your lap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 So if you have a super teeny dog, it's really easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=68.2s	68.2	 You can just lure them onto your lap and you can use a clicker if you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 but you want to make sure to muffle it with some poster tack or lots of layers of tape and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 I have a video in the description below on how to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 It's the one about clicker training and so that way if you do use a clicker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 it's gonna be close to your dog's ears and you don't want to punish them for going on your lap by making a horribly loud noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 So this clicker is muffled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=96.2s	96.2	 but it's loud enough that you can hear it and I'm gonna lure her onto my lap like that, mark and reinforce and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=102.4s	102.4	 then I can mark and reinforce if she stays on there, but she's found a crumb over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 So if your dog is reluctant to go onto your lap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=111.2s	111.2	 you can first lure your dog onto a low mat and then place the mat onto your lap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 Some dogs are extremely polite and they don't want to trample on top of you or who knows why they don't want to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=122.5s	122.5	 onto you and you can first work on going to a mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=125.9s	125.9	 for a couple of training sessions before then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 getting onto your lap. So if your dog is reluctant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=132.2s	132.2	 you can also just mark and reinforce just one foot going up onto your lap like that or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 eating the treats off of your legs at first to help them build confidence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=142.7s	142.7	 Another thing you can do is be in a hallway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=146.2s	146.2	 where your legs are across the hallway and you're just throwing treats over you so that the dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 using you as a platform to go over and get the other treats. Now I don't like to begin this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=159.2s	159.2	 with a really really young puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=162.2s	162.2	 that's going to be in a pet dog home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 unless it's a teeny dog and you don't mind them just trampling you all the time or jumping up at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 But I wouldn't train it as the first behavior. I would train some calm behaviors first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 before working on jumping into your arms like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=183.5s	183.5	 Okay, so I have a little treat in my hand and she's reliably jumping onto my lap so I can say the verbal cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=190.9s	190.9	 jump up show her the treats and then I'm gonna mark and reinforce her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=196.4s	196.4	 multiple times for staying on my lap like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 Good job. I personally don't like to use a clicker that much for this exercise because I'm gonna start to use both of my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=207.8s	207.8	 hands in a second. So I'm gonna lure her up onto my lap saying jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 good, and then I'm going to feed her multiple treats. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=216.6s	216.6	 When your dog is staying on your lap, you can add a release cue like free. So I'm gonna say jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=223.6s	223.6	 epic good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=225.6s	225.6	 good, and then I'm gonna say free and then lure her off my lap good like that and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 reinforce her for waiting until I say jump up again. Are you ready epic?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=238.9s	238.9	 Jump up good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=241.6s	241.6	 good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=243.3s	243.3	 free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=244.3s	244.3	 Awesome. That was very good. So if your dog is doing really well, you can start to incorporate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=250.9s	250.9	 reaching and touching your dog. So if your dog is uncomfortable with this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=255.6s	255.6	 when not on your lap you can work on first touching your dog like this as you feed a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 to get them used to it and then when they're comfortable with being touched and eating the treat at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 you can start to reach touch good and then feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 So your dog is getting used to you just laying your hand on them like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=276.1s	276.1	 because when they jump into your lap, you're gonna then grab them like that. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=282.2s	282.2	 Good job. So I'm gonna say jump up and as I give her the treat, I'm just gonna hold her like this. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=290.8s	290.8	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=293.4s	293.4	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=294.9s	294.9	 Free and I'm gonna give her a treat for jumping off too. Now with a young puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=299.8s	299.8	 I wouldn't have them jumping higher than their ankles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=304.5s	304.5	 repetitively. So if you do this trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=307.2s	307.2	 where you're working with a young puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=309.3s	309.3	 you can just pick them up and put them down after they've jumped up into your arms or your lap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=315.2s	315.2	 as a behavior so that they're not jolting their joints as they jump off of you and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=321.4s	321.4	 you want to keep repetitions to a minimum so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=324.9s	324.9	 if they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=326.1s	326.1	 enthusiastically jumping onto your lap as a young puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 repetitively then that's not a good idea, but a little bit like this amount of training once a week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=335.7s	335.7	 you know where you're doing 10 or 15 repetitions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=339.1s	339.1	 it's not gonna make a big difference if they're just jumping a little bit to get onto your lap like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=346.5s	346.5	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=349.5s	349.5	 The next step is pretending to have a treat and saying the cue jump up. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=354.9s	354.9	 and there's no treat there and then you go and get the dog a treat. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=360.3s	360.3	 She's like hey, wait a second. I didn't get my treat. I might have the treats on this side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=365.2s	365.2	 so it's easier to deliver them. Ready? Epic jump up. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=371.2s	371.2	 There we go. That's better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=373.7s	373.7	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=376.8s	376.8	 Free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=378.0s	378.0	 Awesome. Now I'm gonna go back and use the lure to get her onto my lap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=381.8s	381.8	 Just so that the behavior doesn't deteriorate if she starts to get confused that the treat is out of the picture. Free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=389.6s	389.6	 Jump up. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=395.9s	395.9	 Now I'm gonna practice while I'm kneeling so I'm gonna throw the treat over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=399.7s	399.7	 so it's easier for her to jump up and I'm gonna say jump up and lure her onto my lap and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=404.8s	404.8	 then hold her if she's ready for that step and she is like this. Good. Free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=410.4s	410.4	 Awesome. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=413.3s	413.3	 Jump up. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=416.2s	416.2	 Free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 So for my dogs part of the cue for jumping up is that I hold my arm out like this and I say jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=424.8s	424.8	 Good job. Now I'm squatting like this, which not everybody can do but this is what I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=429.9s	429.9	 I bend down and sit like this to get my little dogs to jump up into my arms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=434.2s	434.2	 But if you wanted to work to where you have your little dog jump right into your arms because you can't bend over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=439.7s	439.7	 Or if you're sitting in a chair and just get them to jump into the chair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=443.9s	443.9	 You don't have to do this step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=445.5s	445.5	 You could just sit on a pillow or sit on the chair that you're using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=449.5s	449.5	 And get the dog to jump into your lap. If you're stationary in a chair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=454.1s	454.1	 You can also raise the ground in front of the chair to get the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=458.5s	458.5	 To make the distance easier for the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=463.7s	463.7	 Jump up. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=469.9s	469.9	 Good job. Jump up. Good boy. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=477.0s	477.0	 Are you ready? Epic jump up. She said whoa, that's really high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=482.9s	482.9	 Ready? Epic jump up. Good. So in this situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=487.3s	487.3	 She's quite high up. So I'm just gonna put her down on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=490.6s	490.6	 As I'm feeding her the treat and it's a great exercise also for teaching your dog to be held
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=497.8s	497.8	 So they're getting held very briefly to be put down on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=502.1s	502.1	 So you have the treat you're holding them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=504.7s	504.7	 They get a treat for you carrying them and then they play the jumping up game again. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=511.5s	511.5	 Jump up. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=515.4s	515.4	 So because I trained myself to do this, I'm going to show you how to do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=519.8s	519.8	 Because I trained my terrier tug to jump up onto my knee like this is the first way to pick him up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=525.4s	525.4	 When I stand up completely instead of having my legs together like that as I squat down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=530.8s	530.8	 I do this and have him jump onto this leg. I find that much easier to do than squatting. Wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=538.2s	538.2	 Good boy. Ready? Tug jump up. Good. And then I can scoop him up and I got him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=545.5s	545.5	 If you have a little dog that's disabled or really old and you're worried about them jumping up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=550.9s	550.9	 For example Kiko her back legs aren't made very well. So if I ask her to jump up, Kiko jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=556.3s	556.3	 She can really only jump up this high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=559.0s	559.0	 But perhaps you have a dog that has injury or pain in their body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=563.6s	563.6	 You can cue them to go into a crate like this zip it up. And then if you need to put them in the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=570.5s	570.5	 You don't have to pick them up. You can just ask them to go in their crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=574.1s	574.1	 Put it into the car buckle them in and then when they reach their final destination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=578.2s	578.2	 Lift the crate out and then cue your dog to come out Kiko free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=582.0s	582.0	 And sometimes she doesn't want to come out because she likes it in there so much. Hey Kiko
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEzQpyJosY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=155&pp=iAQB&t=585.8s	585.8	 Thank you so much for watching
