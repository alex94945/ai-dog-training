https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 Okay, in this short little tutorial I'm going to show you how to condition a positive interrupter noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 What is that you may ask?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 It's a noise you can use instead of saying, no, or eh-eh, or wrong, or stop that, or max.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 So there are a few reasons why you shouldn't say no or eh-eh to interrupt dog's behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 One, it suppresses your dog's behavior. It doesn't teach them what you do want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 Two, you associate yourself with punishment and your dog will be less likely to interact with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 And three, if your dog learns when you're not around, nothing bad happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 They start to only offer the undesirable things while you're gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 So barking, chewing, urinating in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 They will start to do all those fun behaviors while you're not around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 And then that makes them very difficult to train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 It's better to use a sound rather than the dog's name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 Something that always sounds the same, something that can be conditioned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 Like a green light, you step on the gas. It's muscle memory. You step on the gas, you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 The dog hears the noise, which means look at me, or which means look at me, stop doing what you're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 They do it without even thinking because it's become muscle memory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 Where if you use their name, like Kiko, Kiko, hi Kiko, oh you're such a good girl, Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 Then the dog never knows, should I stop what I'm doing and look at you, or are you just saying my name over and over again?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 People overuse their dog's names.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 You can make the same noise into a noise that's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 Your dog will always turn to you, give you 100% attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 So to do that, you just make the noise and feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 And it has to be something really delicious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 Like right now, he's not as excited as he was as when we started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 So two to three minute lessons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 Make the noise, feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 You're associating that noise with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 Here you can see I'm doing the same conditioning exercise with Spooky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 I'm pairing the noise with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 Next step is make the noise and get some eye contact from him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 So I'm going to make the noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 He looks at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 Yeah, if he doesn't look up, I'm going to make some other noises just to get his attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 And now the click is when his eyes meet mine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 And now when he's good at that, you just get longer and longer eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 And when he does something right, you can also pet him as you feed him the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 So he gets used to handling it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 This is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 This means you did a good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 Once you have conditioned the positive interrupter noise, you can now start adding distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 If your dog ever ignores you, that tells you you've raised criteria too fast or the reinforcements aren't really reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 Go back a step or get better reinforcers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 Here you can see I'm working with Spooky and I've added the distraction of being out on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 Can Spooky look back every time I make that noise?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 Yes, good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 Yes, good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 This is one of the first exercises I did with my puppy on the second day that I had him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 Proofing exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 Proof the behavior with different distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 Have the dog on leash and put something just out of reach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 A toy, a treat, another person holding a treat, or a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 Make the attention noise and if the dog turns to you, click and treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 If the dog doesn't turn to you, simply take steps away from what they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 Then try again at a further distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 If they are still unsuccessful, make the distraction less interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 A carrot or something of low interest or the reinforcer of higher value, real meat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 Here you can see I'm using the positive interrupter to interrupt my puppy from chewing on inappropriate items.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 Come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 Hi, you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 Get this instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 You can use your attention noise to interrupt rough play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=281.0s	281.0	 Basically, you call your dogs to you and then re-release them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 If they start playing rough again, then you just make the break between the play longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 Yes! Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=293.0s	293.0	 No matter how you interrupt an animal's behavior, whether it be nice or punitive, you will still be giving your dog attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 So if your dog catches on, that you ignore them 100% of the time except for when they do something bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 and then that's when you blow the fuse or you call them to you and reward them with attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 they're going to start offering those behaviors, those undesirable behaviors just for the purpose of attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 So to solve that problem, you're going to have to start noticing when your dog is being perfect and paying attention to them then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 Don't wait for five hours while your puppy's laying perfectly on their mat or they're sleeping in their crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=335.0s	335.0	 playing with their appropriate toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 Don't ignore all of that and then wait until they suddenly start biting your feet to pay attention to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7RKzuEFrAc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=536&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 because they learn, oh my goodness, humans pay tons of attention to me when I do inappropriate behavior.
