https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=3.0s	3.0	 This is my dog training tip of the day for today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 Counter conditioning your dog to something they're scared of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 My dog Kiko is going to be in this video because she suddenly becomes scared of a certain part of the kitchen floor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 where she slips if she tries to run across the kitchen floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 So now she won't cross the kitchen floor at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 So I'm going to show you how you can condition in just a couple of minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 a dog to gain confidence and forget their fear of something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 For instance, if your dog fell down the stairs and now they're scared to go up and down the stairs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 you can use the same technique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 You're building confidence in the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 A lot of people don't know what to do, so they try pushing their dog over the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 And sometimes it can work. The dog can go, oh, I guess it's not so scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 But sometimes it can go the other way, and you can sensitize your dog even more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 to being on the floor or the stairs or whatever they're scared of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 Come here, Kinks. Come and get the treats. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 Kiko, come on. Get some treats. Come on, baby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 Kiko, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 As you can see, my dog is scared of crossing this area of the kitchen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 I'm going to show you how I'm going to counter condition her to actually like crossing this area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 and get rid of this behavior of being completely frightened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 and uncomfortable when she's in the kitchen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 As you will see in the next clip, Kiko is so scared that she'll slip in that certain area of the kitchen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 that she actually makes herself slip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 Come on, Kinks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Oh. So what I'm first going to do is start by clicking her for being on the area of the floor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 that she's okay with, which is this area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 She has some confidence of standing on this area of the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 So when she comes forwards, I'm going to click any step forwards towards the scary area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 I'm not going to reinforce her for going back to the carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 Now, I don't want to build a behavior chain of come forwards and then go back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 so I'm going to click her for staying on the floor rather than retreating to the carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 Oh, good. She's figured it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 But I want her to be here with me in this area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 Now she's going to choose to go back to the carpet. That's fine with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 But if she wants treats, she's got to stay in this area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 Now, this is different than bribing a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 If I were just to put food down on the floor and have her eat it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 I'm teaching her to love food but still hate this scary environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 It could take tons and tons of pairing of just leaving food on the floor for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 or maybe to actually habituate to the floor, but she's never going to actually like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 This way of conditioning, you're giving the dog, you're clicking the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 for movements of confidence and you're pairing the scary floor with treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Keep changing things up because dogs can learn a behavior pattern of only cross this area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 I want her to be confident with this entire area of floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 Now she's starting to offer tricks so she's feeling a little bit more confident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 We're getting into the danger zone, which is the area near the washing machine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 I'm also going to do some calm handling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 Good girl. Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=223.0s	223.0	 Another trick you can do is put down a treat and click for their confidence in going to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Now I'm going to have no treats and click her for coming into the same area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 Now I'm working on Kiko crossing the floor in the opposite direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 I have to give Kiko some credit here because she actually has no ankles in her back legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 The bones just meet with no joint, so it's pretty much a miracle that she can walk at all,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 let alone across something that's slippery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 Get up. Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 Kiko, touch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 Here I'm using hand targeting to teach her to look up instead of look down at her feet as she crosses the floor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 which usually makes her slip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 Yes. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 Alright, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=304.0s	304.0	 Come on, Kix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 Come on, Kix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPPIxC0J5s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=532&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 Alright, good job.
