https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=4.4s	4.4	 Today's tip is no treats, no toys, no problem. What do I mean by that? How can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 you get your dog to listen to you if you don't have treats or toys that they want?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=14.2s	14.2	 Some dogs, they always want the treats and toys you have and so all you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 do is bring a little piece of hot dog in your pocket and your dog will do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 anything for you. The dog likes the piece of hot dog better than anything in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=26.5s	26.5	 environment. So you can actually build that and condition that but another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 really important aspect of the training is three important things. One, that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 dog isn't over aroused or overexcited or fearful if the dog is suffering from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 these like extreme emotions when you're asking them to do a behavior, their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 brain isn't going to function the same way. They might be in fight or flight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 escape mode and so they're not going to be able to comprehend what the whole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 situation. They're either fighting for their life or fleeing or going to kill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 something, maybe it's prey. So it's important to work on your dog's arousal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=71.2s	71.2	 and excitement first as the topic of what you're going to address in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=77.7s	77.7	 your training. So instead of saying, oh I need to proof my recall, my sit, my stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=84.2s	84.2	 whatever you want, loose leash walking, anything, any behavior that you find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 important. If you want those to be important all you have to do is work on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=92.9s	92.9	 the arousal and then when your dog is not overexcited or scared in a certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=97.8s	97.8	 environment then of course they're going to listen if you've reinforced those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=101.2s	101.2	 behaviors and done some proofing and generalization. The other really important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=108.3s	108.3	 thing to keep in mind is teaching your dog the concept that what they want is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=116.1s	116.1	 contingent on doing stuff for you. So when you ask something of your dog do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=122.4s	122.4	 they think, oh if I do what they want I get what I want or does your dog think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 oh she's asking me that, I don't feel like doing that, I want to do that. If
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=133.7s	133.7	 only you can teach your dog that concept that they get to do what they want to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 by listening to you then it's in their best interest and they find it highly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=143.9s	143.9	 reinforcing because you can reinforce them with the thing they want most. So if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 your dog loves sniffing, loves seeing other dogs, loves people, instead of using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=153.1s	153.1	 toys or treats where they're like I guess I can sit for the treat, oh but I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 really want to see that person and then they finally get to see the person like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=161.1s	161.1	 oh I love this much better than the treats. Instead of using treats and toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=165.1s	165.1	 if they're more interested in something else, social interaction, you can use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 whatever it is that they have that they are interested in as the reinforcer. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=177.1s	177.1	 you ask your dog for something really easy and really simple at a distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=181.3s	181.3	 they're able to do it and then you can say okay go say hello or okay go play at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 the dog park or whatever it is that they want to do, go sniff a bush and pee on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=192.5s	192.5	 it. If that's what their thing is you can make that contingent their bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=198.1s	198.1	 contingent on doing stuff for you. So if you have a marker, a dog that marks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 around in your yard and then you call them back inside and then close the door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 on them you're literally punishing them for for coming to you because you took
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=214.4s	214.4	 away something that they wanted. They were having a great time and you ended
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=218.4s	218.4	 it by using your recall. So if you keep doing that the science behind the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=223.2s	223.2	 training is going to say the dog will come less because you keep taking away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=227.2s	227.2	 the reinforcement and punishing them. So to make it reinforcing you have to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=234.1s	234.1	 strategic in that you let your dog out to pee maybe you ask them to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=238.8s	238.8	 something for you, you let them out to pee or maybe you've gone to a field
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=242.2s	242.2	 they're walking around peeing on stuff, you call your dog back and you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=247.3s	247.3	 start out really easy by you're walking on a sidewalk and letting them sniff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 bushes and then between bushes where they see a bush up ahead and they're on a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 short leash you call your dog to you and they're like oh I really don't want to I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 rather sniff that bush but they can't reach it and they're like okay I guess I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 can turn to you. They turn to you, you reinforce that by saying good go sniff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=270.7s	270.7	 and then you rush over and you're like oh look over there and over there and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 over there and you point out all the spots for them to sniff. Another way of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 making it a little easier is you let them sniff that bush you call them away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=281.9s	281.9	 and let them sniff the same bush so they're finding it easier because that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=286.6s	286.6	 temptation to sniff the bush is less because they they know what it smells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=289.9s	289.9	 like maybe they've already peed on it and then you can begin with baby steps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=293.9s	293.9	 and then build on it so first you're calling them away and they're like yes I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=298.3s	298.3	 can do this with a bush that doesn't smell that much and then to I mean which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=303.4s	303.4	 they've gotten to sniff already and they're not that interested in to more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=306.4s	306.4	 exciting stuff. Another one is you can park in a parking lot at a park and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 there's the green grass that's not reachable yet so it's just boring tarmac
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=317.1s	317.1	 or pavement you ask your dog to come to you might be really hard and you might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=321.3s	321.3	 have to use treats and toys at first and then when your dog comes to you then you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 can say okay go sniff and then let them on a long leash to go and enjoy sniffing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=331.3s	331.3	 around. If your dog just runs straight ahead and pulls you one great thing to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=336.3s	336.3	 do is point out the areas that you want your dog to smell or you could sprinkle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=341.0s	341.0	 treats in the grass and point those out as the thing to get your dog to slow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=344.9s	344.9	 down so they don't just run away from you and then the final step to getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=351.5s	351.5	 your dog to want to listen to you is by not asking too much. They are not robots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 they are living beings with desires and wants and needs. There are certain things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=364.1s	364.1	 that they need and there's certain things they want to do and if we just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=367.9s	367.9	 keep making them do everything that we want them to do all the time it can feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=373.6s	373.6	 like nagging like if you've ever had I don't know maybe you haven't had someone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=378.5s	378.5	 nag on you all the time but constantly being told what to do all the time so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=383.2s	383.2	 giving your dog choices to make and also not nagging all the time so setting the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 environment up for success so you're not always having to tell your dog what to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=394.5s	394.5	 do and the final tip is building a trusting and reinforcing relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=400.1s	400.1	 with your dog so a lot of people will describe online treat training as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=406.1s	406.1	 and yes using treats like that where you bribe the dog I do believe it's damaging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=412.5s	412.5	 for example instead of training your dog to want to go into their kennel some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=418.3s	418.3	 people will try to trick the dog and they have a treat they throw the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=422.4s	422.4	 in and when the dog goes oh boy a treat and then they go in and they eat it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=426.2s	426.2	 then you're like haha now you're in your cage close by and then you leave the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=431.1s	431.1	 can feel tricked the dog feels like whoa every time this person does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=435.5s	435.5	 something I think it's gonna be something good and then it turns out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=439.1s	439.1	 really bad like for example I was playing with my friends okay dogs don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=443.6s	443.6	 talk but they're playing at the park and then the person calls me and then he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=448.0s	448.0	 puts me a leash and puts me in the car and I thought something good was gonna

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=469.6s	469.6	 for behavior that you like so you're not trying to trick your dog into doing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyGC7eWh8Ys&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=84&pp=iAQB&t=485.2s	485.2	 come natural to their breed but also you're asking things of them and
