https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 I've been receiving a lot of emails from people, dog enthusiasts and dog trainers saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=10.3s	10.3	 wow, you've got to check this dog out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=12.4s	12.4	 Can you do this with your dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=14.8s	14.8	 And the videos will show extremely dangerous tricks, as well as tricks that might not be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 very good for that specific dog's body type.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=23.7s	23.7	 The reason that I'm making this video is that I'm seeing a lot of my friends on Facebook,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=27.9s	27.9	 as well as other dog trainers, looking up to these trainers and wanting to copy the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=32.5s	32.5	 tricks that these trainers are doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=35.7s	35.7	 Because the videos are on YouTube, it makes it look like it's an okay thing to do with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=41.3s	41.3	 But I just want to remind people, whenever you're training your dog something, a trick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 obedience, any behavior, you should really ask yourself, is this in the best interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 of my dog, or is this in the best interest of me looking cool?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 Now, obviously, tricks can look very cool, a dog can jump off a building and be caught,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=62.6s	62.6	 but what if that dog slips right on the edge of the building, or what if you mess up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=67.9s	67.9	 as you're catching your dog, your dog falls on their back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=71.2s	71.2	 Do you really want to take that risk with your own dog and jeopardize your dog's safety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 just for a cool trick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 Tricks are like music.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 There are infinite tricks that you can come up with if you just have enough creativity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 But it doesn't mean that you need to be sensational and jeopardize your dog's safety in order
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=91.2s	91.2	 to impress people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=92.9s	92.9	 You can come up with new tricks that only you have invented and wow people with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 fact that they were difficult to train, as well as impressive to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=102.8s	102.8	 So after seeing these videos, I thought to myself, oh my goodness, I wonder if I'm doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 something wrong with my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 So I took all my dogs to the physical therapist and I found out which tricks were best for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=115.1s	115.1	 my dogs and which tricks were not good for my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=118.5s	118.5	 I found out that Kiko shouldn't be crawling because of her body shape and that she should
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=123.6s	123.6	 be doing other things like side stepping, which I'd avoided thinking that that wasn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 good for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=128.6s	128.6	 And both Tug and Kiko aren't supposed to be doing repetitive jumping like in agility,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 so they're not allowed to do agility, which I hadn't been doing with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=138.1s	138.1	 And on my own, I had decided not to teach them the handstand because of their long front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 legs and the physical therapist agreed, yes, that would have been really bad if I'd done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=147.4s	147.4	 the handstand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 So Tug's not even allowed to back up onto objects and Kiko is not allowed to go down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=153.9s	153.9	 the stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=154.9s	154.9	 Now, with our lurcher Lacey, we found out that there was something abnormal about her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=160.3s	160.3	 gait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=161.3s	161.3	 So at the physical therapist, they referred us to an osteopath, so we're going to go there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 before we do anything, any taxing tricks with Lacey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 Another thing that I'm vowing not to do is vaults for frisbee with my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=175.8s	175.8	 I let my dogs jump up and off of me, but not specifically to catch an object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 And in my opinion, it's one of those questions where I ask, is this in the best interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=187.4s	187.4	 for my dog or is this in the best interest for me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=190.1s	190.1	 And because I answered, this is in the best interest for me, I'm actually not going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=193.9s	193.9	 do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=194.9s	194.9	 And I vow never to vault my dog off of my body for frisbee because of the potential
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=199.5s	199.5	 danger that could happen that, you know, one millisecond that the wind blows or I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=205.8s	205.8	 throw the disc incorrectly and the dog slips and falls on their back.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 I don't want this video to make you upset or downhearted about what you've been training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 your dog before or what you were thinking about training your dog, but instead make

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 level freestyle competitions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=239.2s	239.2	 dogs didn't do the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 So they pressed their dog into the position that the behavior was supposed to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 Now the problem with using social pressure, molding where you're pushing your dog around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=253.1s	253.1	 and making them do it is that if their dog does have an injury to their body, maybe they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=258.3s	258.3	 have something wrong with their back or their legs, they might refuse to do a trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=264.1s	264.1	 Now when you start training with things like saying no or ehh, every time the dog refuses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 to do a trick or doesn't do it correctly, you can get into the habit of pressuring your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 dog to do something that's not good for their body.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 positions and things that might be unnatural for your dog, don't use no reward markers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=292.9s	292.9	 your dog knows that it's not good for his own body.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRhiwqrYRg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=380&pp=iAQB&t=311.6s	311.6	 body and good for them living a longer life.
