https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone, I thought I would share with you another training session with my little pup here. I'm planning on naming him dream
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 I'm trying out the name today and see if it sticks and then I will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=11.9s	11.9	 You know decide so sometimes I when I pick a puppy's name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=16.6s	16.6	 I think the name is really cool, but then I just when I try to say it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 I just I just can't so dream so far is working so that might be the name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=25.7s	25.7	 I thought about calling him easy because he's so easy and it's a cute name, but it just doesn't suit his personality anyway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=33.2s	33.2	 The exercises that I wanted to work on the first one that we're gonna work on is the attention noise now when I got him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=40.9s	40.9	 He naturally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 Gaze is up at faces, so I've taken it for granted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=46.1s	46.1	 So I just have to make sure to continue to reinforce it so it doesn't disappear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=50.7s	50.7	 So I've got some really high-value treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=52.9s	52.9	 So it might be actually a little harder for him to look away from the treats because he's not had these before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 so I'm gonna make my kissy noise and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=62.4s	62.4	 Click the moment that he looks up at my eyes and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=65.7s	65.7	 All these exercises that I work on with him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 I'll link the video tutorials in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=71.7s	71.7	 The other thing I can do is wait and see if he offers eye contact like that and mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 So he's looking at my hands behind my back I like to keep my hands behind my back like this because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=89.2s	89.2	 I find it's a little bit easier than when they're out at your side because puppies will generally want to go to the hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=96.9s	96.9	 To try and get the treat and then it can be a little bit confusing and then you're starting to work on a leave-it exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=103.3s	103.3	 More than an eye contact exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=106.7s	106.7	 But he's really good at that, okay, so here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 I'm gonna make the kissy noise now. So I'm gonna throw the treat away like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 Make my kissy noise after he's done eating it and I can click him for first turning in my direction and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=123.6s	123.6	 Then offering eye contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=126.2s	126.2	 He said I would like to stare at your hand because it gives me more information than your eyeballs. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=132.5s	132.5	 Hi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=134.5s	134.5	 So the wonderful thing about eye contact is that if you had a puppy that was worried about the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=140.3s	140.3	 Or didn't know what to do in a certain situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 You could ask your puppy for attention or your adult dog and then you can blink at them and say hi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=149.5s	149.5	 Everything's cool. You don't need to worry and then you can see the puppy can see how relaxed you are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=155.7s	155.7	 Rather or the adult dog. I do this a lot with wish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=159.5s	159.5	 My other border collie who's five now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=161.7s	161.7	 She can still be worried in a certain circumstance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=164.3s	164.3	 And then I just have to smile and blink at her and tell her that it's cool and it doesn't matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 And then she can relax because she trusts that I know what's going on in the environment rather than her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=176.1s	176.1	 Thinking that she has to take care of herself. So that's another great use for the attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=181.1s	181.1	 Noise is getting your dog to look at your face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=184.5s	184.5	 Also if they're looking at something scary and then you have a wonderful trusting positive relationship with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=190.5s	190.5	 Then they look at you and they get a break from looking at whatever or you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=196.2s	196.2	 Experiencing whatever it is that was creepy or worrisome to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=200.1s	200.1	 So I like to use that for behavior modification. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=204.9s	204.9	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 Another thing is is that because I am a dog trainer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=209.4s	209.4	 It's really good for the dog to be able to see the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=212.1s	212.1	 Because I am a dog trainer, it's really good for this puppy to learn that when I talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 It just means keep waiting and that I'm communicating in other ways, even though I'm going blah blah blah blah blah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 But if you're a very talkative person and you're out and about talking to friends on a walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 Maybe you walk with other people you can also practice teaching your dog that when you're talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=235.1s	235.1	 it's reinforcing to do specific behaviors such as walk at your side or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 Relax calmly at your feet when talking is going on but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 here a little little dream is deciding that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 Sitting closer and closer to me in this situation is the best way to get the treat. Hey pupsy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=255.5s	255.5	 Okay, so we worked a little bit on the attention noise and I'm just gonna start proofing it where I'm holding treats out to the side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=263.5s	263.5	 It's very a very common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=265.7s	265.7	 Behavior for proofing the attention noise and I'm holding them far enough away that it's easy if I hold them like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=271.1s	271.1	 The puppy is gonna find it hard to look away from the treats and up at my face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 so if he doesn't think to look I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 Can make an enticing noise like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=282.5s	282.5	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=284.3s	284.3	 And that was he seemed more like confused by the noise I was making then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=290.7s	290.7	 Good awesome and then another thing you can do is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=295.1s	295.1	 After you get the dog looking at your face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=300.8s	300.8	 Good job, you can talk to the dog you're doing so good and try to increase that eye contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=309.1s	309.1	 Hey pop-ups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=312.3s	312.3	 He said it's very hard with the treats good job, it's very hard with the distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=324.3s	324.3	 Oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 This one's hard for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=336.0s	336.0	 So there that's too hard for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=338.5s	338.5	 So I will go back a step and just work on conditioning the attention noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 So I actually haven't as I told you worked on it. Maybe I worked on it 15 times the first day that I got him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=349.8s	349.8	 So that's why he could not do that exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=354.3s	354.3	 But he can easily do it when I have my hands how they usually are or behind my back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=363.4s	363.4	 Or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=364.8s	364.8	 Or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=366.3s	366.3	 And these are also high-value treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=368.5s	368.5	 So all these different factors play into whether you can increase criteria or not in a training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=374.2s	374.2	 So just because I have the high-value treats means I can't get to that exercise of looking away from moving treats at my eyes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=382.7s	382.7	 And also because we haven't worked on it enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=385.3s	385.3	 So you might ask how do you get to the progression from the treats being still to the treats being moved?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=391.6s	391.6	 Starting to move and that simply is is that I need to condition the behavior more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=396.5s	396.5	 So there's a stimulus response association that the dog hears the noise and immediately looks at my eyes because it's been conditioned and reinforced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=404.9s	404.9	 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=406.3s	406.3	 also by slowly changing the picture to make it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=411.1s	411.1	 Easier to go on to the next step so I would work on this step longer where he's looking away from just my hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 still like this and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=421.1s	421.1	 Then I might move them a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=424.1s	424.1	 But not continuously move them up and down so just a tiny movement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=429.2s	429.2	 Good good job like that and then go to where I'm moving them a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=434.4s	434.4	 But then continually make it easier for the puppy so now the hands are gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=438.6s	438.6	 And it's not just getting harder and harder where it can be frustrating if you're a little puppy trying to figure out what's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=444.9s	444.9	 And the most reinforcing thing of course is to look at where the food is going to come from so it's very counterintuitive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=452.0s	452.0	 So don't worry if your puppy gets a little confused or frustrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=456.4s	456.4	 It's just a it's just a matter of doing more training sessions and building that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=461.6s	461.6	 Conditioned response so the best place to work on new behaviors is in your house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=467.1s	467.1	 So that you can get a really strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=469.7s	469.7	 Response if you're out and about and the puppy is distracted by the environment and isn't really interested in your treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=475.9s	475.9	 That's not going to build a strong response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=478.3s	478.3	 So with all the really important behaviors I work on them inside the house first or in my yard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=484.9s	484.9	 Unless the puppy is finding whatever it is extremely reinforcing out and about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=489.7s	489.7	 Hey little one, so I'm just throwing some treats like this because that game was super hard for him, and he's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=495.9s	495.9	 Getting used to chasing and eating the treats and he's not too excited by it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=500.4s	500.4	 If I did this with little epic my chihuahua she might get way too excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=505.4s	505.4	 And then not be able to do the next training so the other game that I wanted to play with him is the restraint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=513.3s	513.3	 so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=514.4s	514.4	 most trainers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=516.3s	516.3	 Well, I don't know anymore, but when I started training everybody did their strength where you hold the dog like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=523.2s	523.2	 This was like 18 years ago, but I still see people doing this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=527.9s	527.9	 so basically what you do is you hold the dog and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=531.3s	531.3	 Then they struggle and struggle and then what they learn is by stopping struggling and and just giving up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=538.9s	538.9	 That's when you let them go so that's based on something called extinction where the dog tries what they usually do and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=547.3s	547.3	 when they fail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=549.1s	549.1	 And they they try so hard and it never works then they learn that the only way to get out of the grip is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=556.3s	556.3	 to just give up so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=560.1s	560.1	 The problem with using extinction is that what can happen is the behavior can get more intense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=565.7s	565.7	 So if your puppy was whining and barking they might start screaming if your puppy was mouthing you they might start biting you harder and harder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=573.3s	573.3	 before they give up and then also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=577.0s	577.0	 Extinction it doesn't just fix the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=581.0s	581.0	 the puppy needs or the adult dog would need to have multiple sessions to generalize and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=587.4s	587.4	 Like any type of behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=589.8s	589.8	 What can happen is the behaviors can come back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=592.2s	592.2	 So not only is the mouthing and biting part going to come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=595.3s	595.3	 But the more intense behaviors could come back to like the screaming and the biting your arms harder than than they thought to do before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=602.7s	602.7	 So I like to use an errorless learning type approach where you're just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=607.7s	607.7	 Reinforcing the puppy for being restrained like this and we've already worked on this and he's very comfortable with handling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=614.2s	614.2	 So I have a video on this and one of the techniques to begin with is simply lowering the puppy between your legs like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=623.7s	623.7	 Whoo, so that you don't have to manhandle them like I did earlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=629.0s	629.0	 He really likes these treats I should have used less exciting treats, but that's okay. There we go and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=637.3s	637.3	 Sitting down like this. So if at any time the puppy wants to leave and they've had enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=642.6s	642.6	 You just let go and they come out but the only way to get the treats is to do the restraint exercise. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=651.0s	651.0	 I'm gonna lure him through here just so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=654.1s	654.1	 Viewers don't manhandle their puppy to begin with so I've got him sitting like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=658.1s	658.1	 And then I'm gonna put my hand on his chest and feed him treats like this good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=667.8s	667.8	 Good and I can calmly pet him and this is gonna help calm your dog down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=673.4s	673.4	 And also help if your dog gets overexcited out and about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=677.4s	677.4	 This is gonna help calm them down where if you didn't work on this and then you try to restrain your dog out and about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=684.9s	684.9	 What can happen is that they can get over?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=688.1s	688.1	 Over excited by this restraint good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=691.2s	691.2	 job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=692.7s	692.7	 You're so good. I also like to use a calm marker working on this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=698.9s	698.9	 Along with other calm behaviors good. So my calm marker marker is good like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=705.3s	705.3	 And you can see that he he's heard that a few times already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=711.7s	711.7	 Good and you can get eye contact from your puppy if you wanted as well. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=718.4s	718.4	 Don't particularly want him looking at where the treats went and you can see he's really comfortable with me restraining him like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=725.3s	725.3	 Then the thing that we're gonna work on in this training session now that we did a little warm-up is putting something out of reach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=731.9s	731.9	 So I put a treat there good and I can mark him good before he struggles to try and get the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=739.8s	739.8	 Good and then I can release him to it. Okay, go get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=744.1s	744.1	 And that is gonna help say for example your puppy or your adult dog wants to meet someone or do something and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=751.4s	751.4	 Prevents them from doing it by holding them picking them up or restraining them if they're a larger dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=757.8s	757.8	 And that's gonna be so helpful because they won't feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=761.7s	761.7	 It's an impulse control exercise. So they won't feel like oh my gosh, I'm being punished
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=767.7s	767.7	 Because I can't get to what I want to and this human being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=771.6s	771.6	 Is just depriving me of all the good stuff in life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=774.4s	774.4	 So basically you're teaching them good that even though they're being held like this. It's in their best interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=781.5s	781.5	 Awesome, and you're conditioning that positive emotional response to being restrained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=787.1s	787.1	 Rather than it being a frustrating thing. It's a calming thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=791.0s	791.0	 Okay, go get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=793.8s	793.8	 Good job, and I haven't worked on leave it with him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=796.5s	796.5	 So what was happening there is I was reinforcing the absence of his choice to go toward the treat before he thought to go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=804.3s	804.3	 Towards the treat so as I put the treat down I fed him and then fed him at a high rate of reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=810.1s	810.1	 And what that caused him to do was when I released him to the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=814.7s	814.7	 He didn't actually want to go to get it, which is great because what happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=819.5s	819.5	 When you play games like this is that you reduce the dog's arousal and interest in going towards things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=826.8s	826.8	 That they're excited about good. So for example if you were doing this game with other dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=833.7s	833.7	 Where your dog wanted to play with another puppy you're gonna reduce that excitement about getting to whatever it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=840.8s	840.8	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=843.1s	843.1	 Okay, go get it see how he's just sitting there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=848.8s	848.8	 There we go awesome, okay, and we'll stop there and so that's enough for one training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj_QdyAycfw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=140&pp=iAQB&t=855.9s	855.9	 Thank you so much for watching if you'd like to support my work
