https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Most owners who are using clicker training are actually hurting their training process by feeding their dog their dinner when the dog is very excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 It's very cute to watch your dog jump in circles and bark when you feed them their meal, but in actual fact that huge bowl of reinforcement is actually building that behavior of arousal and excitement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 And although it's great for us to see our dogs acting really excited, it's not really fair for the dog to have to be in that state of arousal just for their meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 So instead of building that arousal over food every day that you feed your dog, you can do something else, which is when you see your dog calm, relaxed, something that you, you see your dog doing something you really enjoy, that is when you're going to present them with their meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 So in order to do this, you might have to prepare their meal an hour before and it's sitting on the counter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Some dogs, they might have to be outside while you're preparing their food so they don't get all excited and then frustrated when you don't give them the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 So there's their food on the counter. When you see them laying down, settled, you're going to present them with their food while they're in a calm state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 And you'll see me feeding my dogs when they're in a calm state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 Now some dogs, it might be very hard because they're just too aroused. As soon as you touch the food bowl, they're going to flip out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 So what you can do instead is hold some food in your hand and when you see them settled and relaxed and not thinking about food, that's when you're going to slyly go and drop the food between their paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 I have a video on that which I'll link in the description, which is how to get your dog to lay your feet at a cafe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 Basically, it's teaching your dog to settle and be calm as a default.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 This is a tip for not only people who use food to train their dogs, but just any owner who has a dog and feeds them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 You're going to have to feed your dog every day, so you might as well build the behaviors you like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 Build the emotional states in your dog that you do like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKiJlL_xEHs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=562&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 Stay tuned for the next episode of Dog Mantix.
