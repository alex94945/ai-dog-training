https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey guys, today I'm going to show you how I train Splash and Tug, a really cool double
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 dog trick where Tug weaves through the legs of Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 The first step was teaching Tug a cool trick that's actually part of one of our old K9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=25.1s	25.1	 freestyle routines where Tug weaves through my legs while Splash has her feet on my feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=30.8s	30.8	 So that might be a nice goal if you have two dogs that are very comfortable with each other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=36.1s	36.1	 and like doing tricks together to try that out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 Obviously double dog tricks are not for dogs who don't get along or guard food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 I suggest seeking help from a professional positive reinforcement trainer before trying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 to work with your dogs together because it can cause conflict in their relationship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=54.2s	54.2	 So the first step is getting the dogs comfortable with each other and these guys are really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=58.8s	58.8	 confident working together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=60.3s	60.3	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=61.3s	61.3	 Come on, woohoo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=64.3s	64.3	 So, Splash goes between my legs and puts her feet on my feet on the cute cop-cop and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 I taught Tug to weave my legs first but for this trick I'm hoping to treat up here for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 Splash and then I'm luring him through my legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 So Splash is learning not to dip her head down and go for Tug's treat and Tug is learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=88.9s	88.9	 to weave my legs even though Splash is standing on top of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=93.4s	93.4	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 So a lot of dogs can feel really uncomfortable with another dog going between their legs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=99.7s	99.7	 but what you're looking for in your dogs is that they're not putting their ears back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 They're looking extremely interested and happy to get their treat and not feeling oppressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 by the presence of the other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 Hey Tug, ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 Go legs!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 And you can put it on a verbal cue or you can use the same cue that you use for leg

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 Tug, go legs!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 Splash free!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 Awesome!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 The next step was getting rid of my body from the scenario and teaching Tug to weave Splash's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 legs without me being there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 was simply asking Splash to stand and wait and then getting Tug to weave through Splash's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 And I'm holding this treat up here for Splash so she doesn't think to follow Tug's treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ZKpk6RQk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=328&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 Tug, go!
