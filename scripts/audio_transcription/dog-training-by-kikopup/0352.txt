https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=3.5s	3.5	 Teach your puppy to drop a chew stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=6.5s	6.5	 This exercise is not meant for puppies with resource guarding issues or adult dogs who guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 Step 1. Hold a low value chew for your puppy to chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=18.5s	18.5	 Present a high value treat to the puppy, then give the chew back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 Step 2. If your puppy is reliably dropping the chew for the food, you can say drop before you move to give your puppy a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 Drop? Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 Drop?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 Step 3. Ask your puppy to drop the chew, say yes, good boy, or click as he drops it, then feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 Drop? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 If your puppy doesn't drop the chew after you say the cue, either make an attention noise or simply put the food on his nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 If he still won't drop it, it means that you need to use higher value treats and a less valuable chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 Drop? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 Drop?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 And then present the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 If your puppy loses interest in the chew, play with the chew to make it more exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 Drop? Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 Step 4. When your puppy starts spitting out the chew when you say drop, you can try this exercise with your puppy holding the chew on his own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 Drop? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 What's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 Drop? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 Drop? Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 Okay, get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 It's important to build the drop behaviour to be very strong using low value chews first, before continuing to higher value chews.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 Leo, drop? Good job! Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 If you need to take a chew away from your puppy, say for example if the chew got too short, ask your puppy to drop the chew, drop a handful of treats away from the chew,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 and then hold your puppy's harness or collar as you reach to pick the chew up so that the puppy doesn't lunge forwards and go for the chew again after finishing the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 You can practice this scenario in a training session and then give the chew back to your puppy so he doesn't think that every time that you drop treats means that you'll take his chew away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyt2WLdQGs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=353&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Did you guys want to get a chew, hmm?
