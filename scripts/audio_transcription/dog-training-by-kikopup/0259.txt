https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everyone, today's tip is on how to hold your leash, your clicker, and your treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=4.3s	4.3	 when you're working on leash walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=6.2s	6.2	 Now when your dog is already trained, it's a great idea to hold the leash in the hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=10.8s	10.8	 that is closest to the dog so you have more control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=13.5s	13.5	 But when you're actually working on the training, it can get a little bit confusing for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=17.6s	17.6	 dog because, as you'll see, if I have my treats on the other side in my other hand, and, splashy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=24.1s	24.1	 let's go, and I keep feeding her with that hand, even if I try to keep the treats back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=28.7s	28.7	 here when I give them to her, what is happening is she's anticipating the treats coming from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 this location, and what can happen is that your dog can go in front of you and get in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 front of your legs while you're walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=39.9s	39.9	 So instead of that, splash over here, I suggest holding the leash in your opposite hand, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 you can put your clicker in that hand too, and then put your treats behind your dog like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=50.2s	50.2	 this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=51.6s	51.6	 So that when you're walking, your dog is anticipating the treats to come from behind, and as you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 take steps forwards, your dog is more likely to want to hover in that area next to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 rather than forge ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=67.8s	67.8	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=69.8s	69.8	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=73.8s	73.8	 If you're keeping a bunch of treats in your hand instead of in a treat bag, I suggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 holding your hand behind your back so your dog isn't staring at the food and walking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 next to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 Then you can feed your dog a treat and then put your hand behind your back again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=88.4s	88.4	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=90.4s	90.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 The way that I like to hold a leash is the way I was trained at the Humane Society, where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 you take the loop of the leash and you slip it over your thumb and then make a fist like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 The reason I like it so much is also because you can then easily add in the box clicker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=105.3s	105.3	 and be able to click it easily while holding the leash in a secure way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=110.1s	110.1	 However, I suggest if you have a fearful or reactive dog that's hard to control on a walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 and you're worried about holding a leash as well while out and about, I suggest working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 on the leash walking exercises at home where you can hold the clicker in a safe environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=123.7s	123.7	 and then when out and about, you can just use a marker word like yes and have a secure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 grip on your dog's leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 If you need to shorten your leash, you can double it up like this so you have a secure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 grip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhbMzBIIfhk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=260&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 I hope you enjoyed these tips.
