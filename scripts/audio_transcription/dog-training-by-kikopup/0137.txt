https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=4.7s	4.7	 I was making a lot of videos and then suddenly it all stopped and that's because sadly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=10.2s	10.2	 My little puppy dream who was 10 weeks old

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=23.8s	23.8	 that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 He got sick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=27.6s	27.6	 And I took him to the ER and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=30.7s	30.7	 he just progressively got extremely worse really quickly and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 Sadly because of kovat I wasn't allowed to see him and I got to see him very briefly and he just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 looked like a dog that wanted to die and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=57.4s	57.4	 But it didn't work and he basically died of kidney failure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 And it was a little bit hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 Because the whole reason I got him was

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 But she started to go into kidney failure because the treatment was actually killing her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BMhFYpxkHk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=138&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 And I thought she was gonna die but she
