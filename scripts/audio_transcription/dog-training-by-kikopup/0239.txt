https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everyone, today I'm going to show you a fun way to teach a dog to follow a target stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=4.9s	4.9	 Now, I like to teach dogs to follow a target stick with food in the end of it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 and I learned this from the amazing trainer Mary Rae.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=12.1s	12.1	 She actually sells target sticks on her website that have a cool button that opens and closes the end of the target stick,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 so if you have a toy, you can keep the toy inside of there and then release the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=23.1s	23.1	 But if you're like me and you just like to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=25.6s	25.6	 create cheap dog training tools, you can just get a stick and tape a measuring cup to the end of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=32.1s	32.1	 So this is a $1 target stick, and if you have the stuff at home, you can immediately create one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=37.5s	37.5	 Another idea is using a chuck-it stick if your dog doesn't get excited by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=42.1s	42.1	 So if your dog plays ball with the chuck-it stick, it might just be too exciting to use,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 but maybe you have another dog that doesn't like toys, and you can put food in the end of the chuck-it to use it as a target stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=54.7s	54.7	 Unless you're training a behavior like heel work, where the dog has to keep part of their body in contact with the target as the final behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 I don't suggest having the dog touch the target continuously with their nose, because this is a very complex behavior, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=69.1s	69.1	 if they're learning something simple like spinning in a circle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=72.4s	72.4	 and then you don't want them to touch the target and spin in a circle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=76.7s	76.7	 then you have to teach the dog to not touch the target and spin in a circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=80.6s	80.6	 So it makes it much easier to fade the target if you're holding the target slightly above the dog, or a few inches away from the dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=88.4s	88.4	 rather than having them have the task of maintaining contact with the target as they're learning the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=94.3s	94.3	 If you're interested in teaching a continuous targeting behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=98.5s	98.5	 I would suggest calling it a different cue and having a different target stick for the two different behaviors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=104.7s	104.7	 so there's no confusion for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 The first step is teaching the dog how to receive the treat from the target stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=111.4s	111.4	 So I put a treat inside the target stick, and then I'm going to feed the dog the treat on the ground like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 The reason that I like to feed the dog the treat on the ground is the dog is anticipating the reinforcement coming from below,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 making them less likely to think to jump up and hit the target.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=127.1s	127.1	 If you don't want to feed your dog a treat on the ground, you can teach your dog to eat the treat out of the target stick like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=132.9s	132.9	 However, if you use kibble, it can be a little tricky because if they bump the target stick, the kibble can go flying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=139.3s	139.3	 so I suggest using a wet treat. If you feed your dog a treat out of the target stick, it makes it a lot easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=146.3s	146.3	 Once your dog understands the treat delivery, you can now start teaching them to follow the target.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 So put a treat into the target and hold the treat quite far away from the dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 in front of them or above them, and click the moment you see your dog moving towards the target.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=161.5s	161.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=162.7s	162.7	 If your dog jumps, I suggest starting your dog further back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 So you could put a treat down like that and then click your dog walking towards where the target is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 You might have to put a couple of treats down to get further away from your dog. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=178.7s	178.7	 So,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=180.2s	180.2	 once your dog is successful at following the target without jumping or getting overexcited, you can start to add duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=186.5s	186.5	 I suggest moving back and forth in the room or going in a circle. Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=191.3s	191.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=203.3s	203.3	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 You can also start teaching new behaviors using the target stick. Are you ready? Follow. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=221.3s	221.3	 Spin. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 Twirl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhJj8YvG7A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=240&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 Sit.
