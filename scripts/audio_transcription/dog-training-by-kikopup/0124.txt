https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone! I get a lot of requests from my followers about how I set up my pen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 Hi puppy! You want to come in? Come on in!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=8.6s	8.6	 How I set up my pen for my puppy and I thought I would show you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 Now, I haven't done this video yet because the place that I choose to set up my pen is my office
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=21.7s	21.7	 and my office is very messy and so it's my one private place that I like to keep to myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=28.1s	28.1	 But I figured I could just have the camera angle at the pen and you don't get to see what my desk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=34.1s	34.1	 looks like where I make my YouTube videos. I like to set up the pen in a room that I can close the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=39.7s	39.7	 door to. So for example, I have my puppy in the office or you could have your puppy in the bedroom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 and that way you could put music on, leave the puppy, and practice teaching the puppy to be home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=50.8s	50.8	 alone while you are home. It's a little bit more tricky when you have the pen in the living room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 because it's harder to simulate that you're gone if you have an extremely intelligent puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=61.2s	61.2	 and the door to the outside is in the living room so they know when you're actually out of the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 and when you're in the house. So that's why I like to have the pen somewhere like this. I can even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=70.7s	70.7	 leave the door open with music on and then the puppy doesn't know if I'm home or not and it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 starts to not matter because when they're in the pen it's just time to relax and enjoy the things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=80.7s	80.7	 that there are to do in a pen. Now the reason I like to use a pen rather than a crate for leaving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 a puppy is that their body is growing like a toddler and part of that growth is due to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 movement. So to grow naturally their body needs to move and that's why toddlers are doing stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=99.3s	99.3	 all the time. They're choosing to do stuff and then they're choosing to nap. So another nice thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 is if you have a dog that likes to choose different surfaces like a cool hard surface in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 bed they can choose to go to the bed, choose to go to the floor and by making all these choices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 while they're having their alone time they're going to be less excited about being let out of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=124.3s	124.3	 the crate because out of the pen because if they're just in a crate with nothing to do besides stand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 up and turn around when they come out they've been deprived of all these choices so they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=134.7s	134.7	 going to be super excited by it but if they have stuff to do not only are they going to be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=140.8s	140.8	 fulfilled when they come out they're going to be calmer so that's one reason that I like having a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=146.7s	146.7	 pen like this. Also for example like when I'm on my computer I can be on the computer for hours and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=153.9s	153.9	 not worry that the puppy's you know having to sleep the whole time and then I have to worry about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=159.3s	159.3	 entertaining the dog when I'm off the computer. So there are many ways to set up a pen. This is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 the way that is great for for my purposes. The smaller the dog the more room they have which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=175.2s	175.2	 is pretty wonderful. This is the setup for my specific needs for this guy. A lot of times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=183.5s	183.5	 a setup like this is not going to function well for another dog. This is a setup where you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=190.9s	190.9	 assuming the puppy isn't going to try to get out. If you're worried your dog might escape you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=195.8s	195.8	 make an escape proof x-pen. I like to use two exercise pens with eight panels and then make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 a square with one of the eight panels and then disassemble the other one and then use four
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 for the roof and four for the bottom and then zip tie them all together so it makes a cube with a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 door that opens or if you're really worried that your puppy is extremely good at finding zip ties
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=223.2s	223.2	 to chew you could use carabiners or things like that. So another thing here in this pen I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=230.6s	230.6	 know if you can see but there's this door so this could be like an accident waiting to happen so if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=237.7s	237.7	 the puppy was in here I might use something like a carabiner or I'm just going to zip tie this open
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 because I'm not going to just close him in there. So I'm going to zip tie this door to the pen so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 that he doesn't get hurt by it. If the pen doesn't have a secured roof or floor some puppies will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 push the pen to change the shape of it so they can reach things in the room. What I've done with my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=260.1s	260.1	 own pen is taken L-shaped brackets for shelves and bent them to the right shape for my pen and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=266.4s	266.4	 zip tied them on to secure the shape of the pen. If you had a square pen you could leave them at a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=271.5s	271.5	 90 degree angle. And then the other really important thing is thinking about where the puppy might get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=277.9s	277.9	 out. So if you have stuff like a balance disc or something and it makes the floor higher it's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 to make them more likely to get out from there. Also if there's something next to the pen they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=290.2s	290.2	 going to be more likely to want to jump out onto whatever that is and this is the perfect way to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=296.5s	296.5	 get out. So if you have a pen attached to a crate what can happen is they can put their feet up here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 and then grab on and pull themselves up. So if you have a puppy like that one thing to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=309.2s	309.2	 is you can put something on top so they can't get a grip or put it like a at an angle but the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=317.8s	317.8	 solution would be to cover the pen with a metal top. You can get it really depends on your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=326.3s	326.3	 Some puppies you have a beagle that smells some food in the kitchen and they're just desperate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=331.8s	331.8	 to get out. They might figure out a way how to get out of any pen so you might use the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=338.1s	338.1	 metal top but you might just tie a sheet to the top of the pen and the puppy never thinks to bite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 at it and then you have a nice escape proof pen. So it really depends on the dog. Now if you had a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=349.4s	349.4	 puppy that's like terrified of being in a pen or a crate and you've locked them in there and they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=355.7s	355.7	 panicking and breaking their teeth trying to get out that's not what making an escape proof pen is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 about. It's just about preventing an emergency accident if the puppy was just casually trying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=368.7s	368.7	 to get out for food or something not because they're panicking. If you have a dog with separation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=373.7s	373.7	 anxiety I suggest you contact an expert to help you train your dog to not be scared before you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=382.2s	382.2	 start doing home alone training and I'll link an expert in the description below so you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 find out more about how you can teach your dog to be left alone if they're having that issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=396.3s	396.3	 I like to have an assortment of toys for the dog to play with in the pen of different textures,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=402.3s	402.3	 something to chew on. Now again I'm not going to give you examples of what are safe things to chew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=408.6s	408.6	 on because it really depends on the dog. Some puppies might chew off pieces of this or chew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=413.5s	413.5	 this and swallow it so it really depends on your puppy as to what you might think is safe to leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=419.4s	419.4	 to chew on. Maybe if you had a puppy that chews and eats pieces of fabric you might leave a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=425.4s	425.4	 bully stick or something highly digestible that's chewy to entertain themselves with inside the pen.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=437.8s	437.8	 they're less likely to chew on like a flat towel and then in training sessions work on them going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=444.2s	444.2	 into their crate and laying down on the bed and I actually have some kibble in my pocket so that I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=457.6s	457.6	 and if you wanted your puppy to go in the new pen for the first time you could sprinkle kibble just

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=483.5s	483.5	 lay down as well as a separation video on how to begin separation training and I'll link those in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_3eIs1D60&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=125&pp=iAQB&t=514.7s	514.7	 you want the puppy to do when they're in here before thinking of being on the other side of the
