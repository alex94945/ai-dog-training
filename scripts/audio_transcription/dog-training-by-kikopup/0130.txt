https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone, this video is on the topic of teaching your puppy not to bite your legs or clothing when you're walking around or moving around and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 I will link a video in the description below on how to solve unwanted behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=14.2s	14.2	 So you can watch that if this doesn't make sense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=16.8s	16.8	 But the important thing is teaching your puppy what you do want him to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=21.7s	21.7	 So if you notice that your puppy is going after your clothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 Obsessively and it's one of the major problems you're having I would focus on that as one of the major things that you work on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 From day one so that it doesn't become an annoying issue that is hard to get rid of a lot of people ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 What should I do in the moment that it happens now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 It's important not to let the behavior get re-rehearsed in the moment that it's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 But the really important thing is to train the puppy what to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 So when you notice that the puppy is going after your clothes and you say oh this keeps happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 I need to do something about it then choose a moment not at that moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 But when the puppy is calm to work on this behavior if you try to train through the time when the dog is obsessed with your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 Clothing you're not going to have as much success as if you say I need to jot this down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=72.5s	72.5	 And I need to work on it in a training session when the puppy is calm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=76.9s	76.9	 So I'm using low-value kibble if you have a puppy that's super excited about kibble
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=82.4s	82.4	 I'm going to show you two exercises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 This one is with the puppy laying down in a settle and I'll link a video in the description below on how to train a settle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=91.3s	91.3	 But low-value food will work very well for that and then a second part of the exercise is where I'm moving and the puppy's moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=99.1s	99.1	 So if your puppy wasn't settling you could work on that exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=103.3s	103.3	 First and then work on the settle as a first step to this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=110.1s	110.1	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=111.3s	111.3	 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to move and as I move I'm going to mark and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 Reinforce the puppy by dropping a treat calmly between the puppy's paws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=122.7s	122.7	 So at first it can be very calm, but later on I might move faster to give the puppy the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 So I'm going to change the camera angle in a second, but right now all I'm going to do is stand up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=135.4s	135.4	 Mark the puppy good and then drop the treat now these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=140.1s	140.1	 This scenario these pants that I'm wearing that tech pants that I like to wear around the house and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 In the mornings when I train my dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=150.4s	150.4	 They're very flowy and he likes to go for those instead of my jeans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=155.3s	155.3	 So one reason he's doing so good is that he's calm right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=158.7s	158.7	 But what I'm going to do is take steps good and mark as I take the step good and feed a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 Good. So what I'm doing is reinforcing the absence of the behavior that I don't like and the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 I do like is him being calm around the stimulus that I don't want him to go after my pants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 So the wonderful thing about having the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=183.4s	183.4	 Settling or sitting is that it's very obvious to see when they're too excited because they'll get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=188.4s	188.4	 So if the dog gets up you need to slow down the training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=191.6s	191.6	 You also don't want to make it more and more exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=194.4s	194.4	 So if he's good with one step then in two steps and three steps then running around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=198.9s	198.9	 You want to keep going back to where it's easy for the puppy so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 You don't mess up and the puppy gets overexcited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=206.4s	206.4	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 So I'm going to take a couple steps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 Jiggle the fabric a little bit good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=221.4s	221.4	 When the puppy's doing really well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=222.9s	222.9	 You can make the distraction wait a little bit then mark and feed the treat or do the distraction for longer increments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=230.6s	230.6	 So you might walk a step and mark as you make the first step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=234.8s	234.8	 But then you might make a couple more steps before marking and reinforcing to generalize the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 I'm going to use a couple different materials that are more flowy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=244.9s	244.9	 And work on the same exercise with the pup now if he started getting overexcited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 I'm just going to end the session and then work on it at another time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=254.2s	254.2	 So first this shirt can simulate a dress good because I'm not going to wear a dress in this tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=260.9s	260.9	 I might get someone else to do that good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=264.2s	264.2	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=269.9s	269.9	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=272.9s	272.9	 And the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=274.7s	274.7	 Reason that my puppy is being so good is that I'm making the steps small enough so that he can succeed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=279.8s	279.8	 I've chosen the correct reinforcement, which is the lower value kibble that he is enjoying and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 I've chose a time of day that he's pretty calm. So he's already enjoyed playing with my other dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=291.8s	291.8	 He had a nap and now he's kind of just settled and interested enough in the food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=300.1s	300.1	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=303.7s	303.7	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=310.5s	310.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=312.1s	312.1	 This is enough for one training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=314.1s	314.1	 And I'm going to show you the next exercise in a little bit when I have some higher value treats and the puppies had a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=321.5s	321.5	 Break, but I'm also going to increase criteria right now to show you what to do if the puppy does get up. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=329.4s	329.4	 You might have a helper that's a little over enthusiastic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=333.2s	333.2	 Well, and there he gets up so that was too much and I'm just going to lure him back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 Into the down position and then go back to making it super easy for him like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=345.1s	345.1	 Good job. Awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=348.5s	348.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=351.3s	351.3	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 Yay, it's all finished. Come on, let's go outside. You need a break to go to the bathroom puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=364.1s	364.1	 For this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=365.1s	365.1	 I like to use the clicker because the puppy is going to be moving with me and I can mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=370.6s	370.6	 Precisely that moment that the puppy is in the position next to my side and I can mark the puppy for moving with me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=377.4s	377.4	 So I actually worked on this exercise for a minute or so yesterday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 I've had the puppy for four days pop ups and so to get the puppy in the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=387.4s	387.4	 I'm gonna drop a treat behind me and as the puppy catches up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 I'm gonna mark before he gets to me at first and then block him from getting ahead of me by feeding him the treat that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=398.2s	398.2	 He wants so if your puppy was worried about being blocked like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=402.1s	402.1	 It probably means that he doesn't want the treat that you're giving him good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=407.5s	407.5	 So I'm gonna mark him moving with me and I'm also gonna mark him standing at my side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=412.7s	412.7	 So not only are you working on teaching the puppy to walk at your side, but you're also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=419.6s	419.6	 Reinforcing that puppy for not biting your pants as you're moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=424.2s	424.2	 So I like to use a coffee table or a chair and work first with the dog on the inside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=430.8s	430.8	 Marking and reinforcing for standing at your side take a step forwards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=436.0s	436.0	 Mark and reinforce if the puppy thinks to lay down you can put a treat out ahead of him to get him up again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=442.4s	442.4	 So he's looking for those treats. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=445.2s	445.2	 Then when the puppy is doing really well, you can increase how long you walk and you can also start hiding where the treat is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=453.7s	453.7	 So that your puppy isn't just staring up at the treats, but he's walking at your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=458.9s	458.9	 And seeing your legs moving and you there and that when he looks at that that is he's finding it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=466.2s	466.2	 Reinforcing to walk at your side without biting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=468.9s	468.9	 If you just have the treat there in the picture the whole training session, you know always when there's no treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=475.0s	475.0	 He's gonna start biting your legs again. So it's really important to remove the treat from the picture

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=485.2s	485.2	 But the first step in the training session that I already did was just marking and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=490.1s	490.1	 Reinforcing him for walking at my side like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=492.9s	492.9	 So now I can hide my hand behind my back and get that same behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=498.6s	498.6	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=503.0s	503.0	 He almost thought to bite the edge of the table didn't you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 Okay, so that went really well now I can work on it with the leash attached to him because he also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=516.7s	516.7	 Likes to bite at his leash now. I'm gonna work on the same exercise, but with the leash attached to the puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=523.4s	523.4	 so I've got the clicker and the leash in my right hand to have the puppy on my left side and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=530.0s	530.0	 I'm gonna throw a treat back here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=532.7s	532.7	 To lure the puppy back and then as he catches up with me I can mark and reinforce and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=540.5s	540.5	 Play the same game. So by already doing the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=543.6s	543.6	 He's gonna be less likely to want to bite on the leash. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=547.3s	547.3	 And at first it can be very simple like this and then later on it can be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=553.1s	553.1	 Exaggerated where the leash is moving around more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=556.9s	556.9	 like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=558.9s	558.9	 Good good boy, you can also practice having the puppy follow you where the leash is right in front of his face like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=567.3s	567.3	 Because at some point maybe your puppy will pull and then you'll have to get your puppy back to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=572.5s	572.5	 And as you're getting your puppy back to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=575.1s	575.1	 The leash is gonna be right there in front of his face and he might be a little frustrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=578.2s	578.2	 Because he didn't get to go to say hi to the aggressive dog and he might bite at the leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=583.9s	583.9	 So he's just getting used to seeing leash I can also practice switching it over to the other side like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=595.2s	595.2	 Good boy, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=598.6s	598.6	 And I chose as I said I chose the correct time of day that he's not too overexcited by the food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiKg783-Yw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=131&pp=iAQB&t=605.9s	605.9	 Thank you so much for watching. If you'd like to support my work
