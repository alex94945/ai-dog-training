https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, in this video we're going to go over puppy safety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 Now puppies aren't made of glass, but we need to take care when training them, letting them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=10.5s	10.5	 interact with the environment, and also when letting them interact with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 Now in my opinion, the three most important things to consider are the repetition of movement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 jumping and jolting, and rough play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=25.8s	25.8	 In this video we're going to go over all of those, and I think it's really important for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 all puppy owners to know about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 So that's why I made this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 So why is it important to limit rough play as well as jumping and jolting movements in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 puppies?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 Well, their bones, ligaments, muscles and joints are all in the process of growing and are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=45.2s	45.2	 more susceptible to injury than in the bodies of adult dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 Now there's something in puppies' long bones that are called growth plates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 Now these consist of several specific cells that allow the bones to grow, and they only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 close between 12 to 20 months of age, depending on your dog's breed and size.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=63.7s	63.7	 Now it's generally accepted that while these growth plates are still in your puppy's body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 or your adolescent dog's body, you shouldn't have your dog jump repetitively higher than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 their ankles, which seems completely crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 But this doesn't mean that you should never let your puppy ever jump until they become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=81.7s	81.7	 12 to 20 months and then suddenly start drilling them on jumps and agility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=86.5s	86.5	 It means take care not to repeat jumping higher than the ankles until the growth plates have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 closed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=93.6s	93.6	 And then after that, you're going to carefully work your dog's body up and muscles up to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 be able to jump as high as you wanted your dog to jump, rather than suddenly crazily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 letting them jump just because the growth plates have closed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=109.2s	109.2	 So here are some other things to consider in regards to preventing injury.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 The correct diet, how much you feed your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=116.7s	116.7	 If you're feeding too much or too little, you can leave your puppy susceptible to injury
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=121.2s	121.2	 and incorrect growth process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 Sleep and exercise are also really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=126.1s	126.1	 The puppy's got to be getting enough sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=128.4s	128.4	 And exercise, the puppy shouldn't be getting too much or too little exercise, as that can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 be detrimental to their health and also can cause injury.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=138.8s	138.8	 Jumping and jolting movements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=140.4s	140.4	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=141.4s	141.4	 Puppy, jump up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 Say you've been watching TV with your puppy, woo, and he doesn't want to stay with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=147.3s	147.3	 anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 He wants to jump down and play with his toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=150.1s	150.1	 Instead of just letting him jump off the couch, you can help him down to prevent him jumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=155.9s	155.9	 higher than his back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=158.3s	158.3	 Now that can be very jolting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=160.9s	160.9	 This is really, really, really important for toy dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=164.2s	164.2	 I see a lot of people with toy dogs that aren't taking care with the dog jumping on and off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=168.5s	168.5	 of their really high bed or letting the dog run down the stairs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=173.5s	173.5	 If you're not like me and you don't like to micromanage your dog, then simply teach your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=177.4s	177.4	 dog to sleep in a dog bed on the ground to keep them safe from jumping up and off of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=182.2s	182.2	 the couch all the time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=186.7s	186.7	 You can carry your puppy down the stairs to prevent injury.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=189.5s	189.5	 If this is not possible, you can have your puppy on a leash or train your puppy to walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 calmly.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=201.3s	201.3	 Train and play on non-slip surfaces like grass, padded floor, or carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=205.7s	205.7	 So I've just got Wimos some food over here and I'm reinforcing him on the ground for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=211.7s	211.7	 not jumping up in the kitchen because the floor here is very slippery and if I were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 just to walk on in with his food goal, he might think to jump up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=221.5s	221.5	 So as I walk, I'm going to drop food down on the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 You can also use a marker right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=228.9s	228.9	 If you're worried your puppy might jump chaotically, then you can practice these games with your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 puppy's food and toys on a non-slip surface first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=238.2s	238.2	 So another really important concept for me in preventing injury in puppies, but also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=242.2s	242.2	 in adult dogs, is having your puppy or your adult dog wear a harness when attached to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=247.7s	247.7	 a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=248.7s	248.7	 Now this is because if the puppy runs and hits the end of the leash, suddenly there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=253.4s	253.4	 a huge jolting action right on their neck, which is very delicate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 So when fitting a harness, I like to make sure that the harness doesn't rest on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=262.1s	262.1	 neck if the dog were to pull and also doesn't impede the leg movement when the dog is walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=269.1s	269.1	 Now, all dogs are different shapes, so one harness might fit your dog, but it might not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=275.5s	275.5	 be a good harness for another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=277.5s	277.5	 So you basically need to put the harness on and see if it touches the dog's neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=282.2s	282.2	 If the dog is making a gagging sound in the harness, then it's basically working in the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=290.6s	290.6	 The longer the leash is, the more force to the jolt if your dog or your puppy were to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=295.9s	295.9	 hit the end of the leash.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=370.2s	370.2	 So I'm going to give you some tips on how to avoid drilling your puppy on the same behaviours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=375.4s	375.4	 One way of doing it is counting out how many treats you're going to use during the training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=378.8s	378.8	 session.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=383.6s	383.6	 And a third way is you can film your training sessions and watch them back.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=393.7s	393.7	 So by doing these types of methods, it stops me from over-training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 Another idea is keeping a training log.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=400.5s	400.5	 So you keep track of which behaviours you work on each day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=404.6s	404.6	 And what I do is I plan to not train the same behaviours for at least three days if there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=410.6s	410.6	 something that involves a really physical movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=414.0s	414.0	 So for example, if I'm teaching leg weaving and I've worked on it quite a lot, I might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=417.9s	417.9	 spend two days not doing leg weaving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=421.4s	421.4	 Stand to down, stand to down is quite a physical behaviour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=424.1s	424.1	 So you're not going to make your puppy repeat that every single day because that could be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=429.4s	429.4	 bad for their joints.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=431.0s	431.0	 So that's the example I'm going to use right now for this training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=435.9s	435.9	 We're just going to work for stand to down for ten treats and then we're going to move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=439.6s	439.6	 on and do some other exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=442.3s	442.3	 The more behaviours your puppy knows, the healthier I believe they will be because they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=447.3s	447.3	 using all their muscles rather than simply repeating the same behaviours over and over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=452.5s	452.5	 again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=453.7s	453.7	 So that's why I really like to do canine freestyle with puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=457.2s	457.2	 So I'll do my training demo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=459.2s	459.2	 Where did I put my clicker?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=464.2s	464.2	 So the last three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=467.2s	467.2	 Ready?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=474.2s	474.2	 Stand.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=492.7s	492.7	 If you're going to teach spin to the left, you also want to teach spin to the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=499.6s	499.6	 Leg weaves is also another great behaviour to practice with your puppy but obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=504.7s	504.7	 all these behaviours you don't want to do them repetitively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=507.9s	507.9	 So a great way to prevent this from happening is to teach multiple behaviours and practice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=512.9s	512.9	 them on different days of the week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=516.5s	516.5	 Tugging with your puppy is a fun activity and can also be used as a reward during training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=521.1s	521.1	 However you want to keep in mind it is a behaviour and so the concepts of jolting and repetition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=527.3s	527.3	 apply to tugging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=528.8s	528.8	 You don't want to hurt your dog by playing too much tug with your dog or playing too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=533.6s	533.6	 roughly with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=536.6s	536.6	 So there's this misconception that you should train one behaviour first with your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=541.5s	541.5	 and then when that behaviour is really good you move on to the next behaviour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=545.8s	545.8	 Well not only is there a problem with the fact that your puppy will be repeating the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=549.3s	549.3	 same movement over and over again but it's also not good mentally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=555.3s	555.3	 Dogs thrive on variety and so you can make training sessions fun by adding variety of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=560.9s	560.9	 behaviours to the training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=563.1s	563.1	 So in my opinion I would in a training session you can work on spin to the left and spin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=569.3s	569.3	 to the right right in the same training session or if you want to work on the dog circling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=575.3s	575.3	 around you you can practice going one way and then going the other way right in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=582.7s	582.7	 same training session.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=589.3s	589.3	 All these dogs over here are lying really calmly waiting for me to finish training Lumos

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=600.4s	600.4	 If you want to practice eye contact, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=605.4s	605.4	 You can click and reinforce that or say yes and reinforce eye contact, a calm settle,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5tfV2A8rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=361&pp=iAQB&t=625.3s	625.3	 Leave it.
