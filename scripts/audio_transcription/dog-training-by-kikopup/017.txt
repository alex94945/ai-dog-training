https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vc44EwvlvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=18&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 in order to have the dog have some positive experiences and build his her confidence around other dogs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vc44EwvlvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=18&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 It's not about moving slowly and taking months to train each dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vc44EwvlvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=18&pp=iAQB&t=43.9s	43.9	 So if you have one dog that is extremely comfortable and social and a great helper dog you can use that dog
