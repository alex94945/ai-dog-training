https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, today's tip is for dogs who can be under motivated by food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=5.3s	5.3	 Here's an example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 My border collie, she loves toys but sometimes she can be very unmotivated or have zero interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=12.3s	12.3	 in treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=13.3s	13.3	 So I'm going to offer her these treats here and you can see that I dropped them to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 floor and she's uninterested in eating them and looks almost punished by the fact that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=23.5s	23.5	 I gave her such disgusting stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 So what can you do if this happens to you or you have a dog that just has more interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 in toys rather than food?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=34.4s	34.4	 One thing that you can do with your dog is do a treat test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 So get a variety of different treats, some that your dog hasn't had before and see how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 interested your dog is in each treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 So the first treat that I gave to Wish, which is this kibble, she shows no interest in eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 So that's not even reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 She's almost a punisher to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=55.5s	55.5	 You see, she's hanging her head down low and not looking at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=60.1s	60.1	 Now I will try this other type of kibble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 So she sniffs it, she crunches it and she looks back at me so she found that reinforcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 but not amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 Now this very expensive raw food treat, she swallowed it but doesn't look like amazingly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=79.5s	79.5	 excited but she's still focused on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 If you give your dog a treat and you're in a non-distracting environment like this room,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=87.9s	87.9	 this is the first kibble that I gave her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=90.8s	90.8	 She ate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 If you give your dog a treat that they're not very interested in, you'll see that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 eat it and they look away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=97.3s	97.3	 So a signal that your dog is interested in the food is that after they've eaten the food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 they say to you with their eyes, more please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 And that means that they will look at you or look at the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 So that's the signal that you're looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 Now this last treat is boiled chicken that I made and I know for a fact that Wish really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 likes the boiled chicken out of all of these treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 And the reason I know that is because she's the most motivated to eat this chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 Once you've found a treat that your dog is interested in, I suggest doing a training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 session just before when your dog is usually fed and that will make your dog more interested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 in working for food because he's already ready for his dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=139.3s	139.3	 Now if you have a dog that's very excited about food, you want to avoid times where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=144.1s	144.1	 your dog might be a little bit hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 So if you had a dog very excited about food, then you would do the training session maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=151.1s	151.1	 after dinner and obviously not work on very exciting tricks where your dog is moving a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 lot because they've just eaten their dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 It can feel very frustrating if your dog isn't very interested in the treats you have or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 has low motivation while you're training, but there are two things that you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 And that is using words to encourage your dog over and over again because what can happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=172.5s	172.5	 is every time your dog is not motivated, you say those words, soon your dog is going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 start associating those words with times that he hasn't been that interested in food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 So if your dog is acting really slow and you say, come on, come on, come on, come on, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=188.3s	188.3	 not going to help speed your dog up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=191.3s	191.3	 It would help speed your dog up if you said, come on, and then threw a treat or said, come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=196.9s	196.9	 on when your dog was excited at times when your dog was excited because then that would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=202.4s	202.4	 help speed him up in the training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 But if you start nagging your dog or trying to encourage your dog verbally, it can actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 be off-putting and sometimes even punishing to the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=213.8s	213.8	 Another thing that you don't want to do is if your dog's not interested in what you have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 pushing it in their face, waving it around to get them interested in it, that can actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=223.7s	223.7	 have the reverse effect and it can make the dog not interested in what you have because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 you're being too pushy with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 It's like if you don't want to eat a piece of food and someone keeps bothering you to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 try and give it to you when you know you don't want to eat that, it's going to get on your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=240.2s	240.2	 nerves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=241.2s	241.2	 So instead of doing that, you can build your dog's motivation for treats that they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=246.7s	246.7	 interested in by playing hard to get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 One thing you can do is put a treat down on the ground and walk away from your dog holding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 the treats like they're something very exciting and you're playing keep away from the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=258.6s	258.6	 with the treats rather than going into the dog's space with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=262.5s	262.5	 So now they're seeming like something that you really want and you're dropping one and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=266.7s	266.7	 then moving away quickly, guarding these treats up here like they're something amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 You can even pretend to eat them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 Oh, these are so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=275.4s	275.4	 Mmm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=276.4s	276.4	 Oh my goodness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=280.4s	280.4	 And you can see here that my acting is really working with Wish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 She really wants these treats that she wasn't that interested in earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=289.5s	289.5	 Another thing you can do is throw the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 So you throw a treat and you can even click your dog for going for the next treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=299.4s	299.4	 And you can add an exciting noise if you want like ready steady.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=304.4s	304.4	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=305.7s	305.7	 And now you can see that Wish is quite excited for these treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=308.7s	308.7	 Hey, Wishy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=310.3s	310.3	 If your dog is showing low motivation in a training session, I suggest quickly stopping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=314.8s	314.8	 and not trying to work through it because what you can do is create a habit where your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=319.2s	319.2	 dog sees the training picture as something boring and not really that reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 So when I see that happen in my training session, if suddenly a dog seems disinterested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=330.1s	330.1	 instead of trying to train something new or maintain an existing behavior, I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=334.7s	334.7	 go back and figure out what the dog finds reinforcing and start using that as the reinforcer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=340.5s	340.5	 or just stop the training session and try at a later date when the dog is in a better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYAD9eDBzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=268&pp=iAQB&t=345.3s	345.3	 mood.
