https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone! This video is on the topic of preparing to take your dog to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=4.7s	4.7	 dog training class. This video was voted into creation by the channel Kikopup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=9.2s	9.2	 members, so thank you channel Kikopup members for your support. It's greatly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 appreciated. Now to get started. Besides what the instructor tells you to bring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 to the class, I suggest having a variety of different treats to use as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=23.4s	23.4	 reinforcement. So the minimum amount, I would say at least three different types
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=29.1s	29.1	 of treats. However, if you have a dog that really likes novelty and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 trainer is going to be using your dog and there are going to be other people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 in the class using high-value treats and perhaps dropping crumbs, your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 going to start finding if your dog enjoys novelty these other distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=47.7s	47.7	 more reinforcing than the treats you have. So having a library of different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 treats can be extremely helpful to pick and choose and you're providing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=57.3s	57.3	 So with my own dogs, I will sometimes go and buy special treats at the store and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 then only open the bag in the class so the dog is very interested in what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=65.6s	65.6	 have and it's an exciting novel surprise when we get to a class. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=70.9s	70.9	 can have a backpack if you're going to bring a bunch of different treats or a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=75.1s	75.1	 little cooler bag and store the treats in there and then you can pick and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=79.1s	79.1	 choose and experiment in the first few classes and then you might not need to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=83.6s	83.6	 bring that many different treats the next few times. In fact, if you have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=88.2s	88.2	 foodie, a dog that just loves food, you might just bring one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=94.3s	94.3	 treat. I don't want to say Labrador but I'm thinking Labrador. You might, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=98.3s	98.3	 kibble, carrots, roast beef, they might all be high-value treats to your dog so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 you wouldn't have to do this variation but some dogs are really really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=109.9s	109.9	 interested in novelty treats. So also depending on the dog's personality, some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=116.4s	116.4	 dogs might find a really high-value treat at the start too exciting. I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=122.1s	122.1	 thinking Labrador again. So that treat could over excite the dog and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 might use a medium or low-value treat to begin with and then move to high-value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=131.7s	131.7	 where with another dog, say for example my boy Bliss, when we get to a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 location, he's social and friendly and so I'm going to use the higher value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=143.1s	143.1	 treat at first to compete with the environment and then when he's more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=147.3s	147.3	 relaxed, I'm going to move to the medium and lower value treats to reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 calmer behaviors like a settle but I might not use those high-value treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=155.6s	155.6	 only at the beginning of the class to get his interest in wanting to be with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 me and not create that frustration of everything else seems better than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=165.2s	165.2	 being with me on leash when you can't get to what he wants. It's also really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 important to give permission when your dogs are allowed to greet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=173.7s	173.7	 So if you're going to a class environment where your dog is allowed to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=176.7s	176.7	 say hi to people and dogs, first ask the instructors if you're allowed to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=182.7s	182.7	 that, then ask permission from the person and then you can give your dog permission
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=187.2s	187.2	 to say hello and that's going to greatly reduce the frustration so the dog doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 see seeing other dogs and people as the predictor and the cue to say hello and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 then seeing those cues or signals that they should say hello is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=204.3s	204.3	 frustrating when they can't so the the the predictor that they'll say hi is you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=208.9s	208.9	 giving permission and that's going to greatly reduce frustration. Also you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=213.5s	213.5	 to make sure that if someone says it's okay and you let your dog over that if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 they are backing away or looking uncomfortable that you you respect that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=222.8s	222.8	 other dogs discomfort and and then recall your dog and too bad your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=230.2s	230.2	 doesn't get to say hi and that's going to really help the other dogs in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=233.7s	233.7	 class. Okay so treats, bringing different types of treats. I do have a video on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=239.7s	239.7	 different what treats to use and I'll link that in the description below and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=244.0s	244.0	 you can watch that if you're not sure what type of treats to use and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=247.4s	247.4	 treats I talk about in those videos are in that video is good for for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=251.5s	251.5	 training class. I suggest bringing a mat to a training class. This can be a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=256.7s	256.7	 piece of home that you can bring with you to help your dog feel comfortable. Now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=261.3s	261.3	 you might not want to do this if you have a dog that resource guards beds or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=266.2s	266.2	 space so if you have a dog that guards you or beds or space or treats and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=272.4s	272.4	 keep putting treats on the mat and that's the location your dog's expecting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 treats then I would suggest not having a mat and continuing to move rather than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=281.7s	281.7	 always be in the same place and each class choose a different location don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 always sit in the same corner because it's going to help the dog out if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=291.1s	291.1	 they're having a resource guarding issue and if if it's a really big resource
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=295.3s	295.3	 guarding issue you need to talk to the trainer about it before coming to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=299.7s	299.7	 class because sometimes even if you tell people and other people in the class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=304.7s	304.7	 they're going to come closer than you want them to so if you if your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=308.7s	308.7	 guarding food within like five feet or guarding you it's a good idea to do

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=318.5s	318.5	 can actually exacerbate the guarding problem if you're trying to learn

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=327.2s	327.2	 there's lots of high-value food and stress in the environment. Okay to get

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=343.1s	343.1	 what to do so that mat being there is the situational cue to relax on it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=347.8s	347.8	 lay down and get treats because you worked with it at home at the park on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=362.6s	362.6	 can get frustrated say for example bark or wine or paw at you I suggest going to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTkssmZp-A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=68&pp=iAQB&t=388.5s	388.5	 you're learning in the class if you have a dog that can easily frustrate when
