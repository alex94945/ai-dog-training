https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone! This video is on the topic of using management and prevention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=4.7s	4.7	 when training your dog. Now a very easy to understand example of this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=8.9s	8.9	 teaching your dog not to counter-surf. Now it's wonderful if you spend 20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 minutes in a few training sessions marking and reinforcing your dog for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=19.1s	19.1	 ignoring food on the counter but if your dog hasn't yet learned to reliably leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=24.3s	24.3	 that food alone and you leave the house to go somewhere and you leave food out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=28.9s	28.9	 all over the counter and your dog is tall enough to reach it at some point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=33.2s	33.2	 your dog might be thinking oh that smells good puts his paws up on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=36.9s	36.9	 counter and then is highly reinforced by large quantities of novelty food that he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=42.5s	42.5	 might not have ever had before and then that experience is so reinforcing it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=47.6s	47.6	 going to be more reinforcing to do that when you leave the house than to ignore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=52.7s	52.7	 the food. So what can happen is if you're not done training your dog to reliably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=58.8s	58.8	 leave food on the counter when you when you go and then your dog has these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 wonderful reinforcing moments when you're when you're gone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 counter-surfing it's actually going to increase the likelihood that your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=70.9s	70.9	 going to counter-surf for life. So what I suggest especially if you just get a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=76.9s	76.9	 dog or new puppy that you highly manage and prevent all these behaviors you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 don't want until you've put in the time to train your dog. So it is extremely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 exhausting as an owner in the beginning if you're doing all this management it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 can feel exhausting but what you're doing is saving yourself all this stress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 and management in the future for example years worth of having to hide the food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 on the counter. So when I got my Border Collies they're tall enough to reach the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=112.9s	112.9	 kitchen counters and I made sure right in the first few weeks to work on not not going after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 food on the table with low tables because they couldn't even reach the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 kitchen counters so that when they got tall enough to reach the kitchen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=126.7s	126.7	 counters I could work on it but I have all these dogs that I can leave with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=131.5s	131.5	 food on the counters if I so wish and I don't actually eat meat and I probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=137.6s	137.6	 wouldn't leave meat out on the counter so maybe it's not as enticing for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=141.4s	141.4	 dogs as someone who who's a meat eater that that leaves food on the counter but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=147.2s	147.2	 it's extremely easy because I don't have to manage the kitchen every time I leave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=152.8s	152.8	 so all that work that I put in right at the beginning is paying off all the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=157.8s	157.8	 down the line and that's why I think it's extremely important to use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=162.2s	162.2	 management and prevention until you're getting reliable behaviors. An example of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=167.7s	167.7	 using prevention that could solve the behavior problem completely is say if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 you got a new puppy and the puppy as soon as they got to the water bowl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=175.7s	175.7	 started digging in the water bowl or splashing the water out with their mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 instead of trying to train the puppy how to interact with the water bowl that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 it's just for drinking you could get one of those no-spill water balls or one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 those little buckets those metal buckets that you can clip to the side of an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=193.4s	193.4	 X-Pen or a wall and then it's just high enough that the puppy can dip their head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 in to drink from and just by changing what the water bowl looks like and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=203.2s	203.2	 making it not as inviting to want to dig in or turn over or pick up and take away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=209.7s	209.7	 then after a couple of weeks you could reintroduce the water bowl that you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=215.5s	215.5	 the dog to use and sometimes the dog won't even think to dig in it anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 because they've associated the bowl in the corner meaning all about just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=224.3s	224.3	 drinking water rather than playing with. Another example of using management and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=229.6s	229.6	 prevention when training is if you're working with a dog that can be fearful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 reactive or maybe overexcited about certain stimuli in the environment say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=239.2s	239.2	 for example the dog is fearful or reactive or overexcited about people and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=244.4s	244.4	 you work on it when you're out and about your dog sees a person you say good and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 feed them a treat before your dog reacts but then you go to work and say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=252.8s	252.8	 goodbye and then you leave them and your dog runs to the window and can see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 people passing and is either having a fearful response or reacting at the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=267.9s	267.9	 more likely to regress to reacting to these stimuli so it's for my training I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42OOTnTETNw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=169&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 suddenly you can't escape somebody and then your dog reacts that's not going to
