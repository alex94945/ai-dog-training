https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, this video is on tips for choosing helper dogs when working with dogs on issues such as fear,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 reactivity, aggression, or over arousal towards other dogs as well as preventing these things from happening with puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 Now if you are training your own dog and you're watching this video,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 I suggest that you get help from a professional trainer that doesn't use any forms of physical or psychological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 intimidation to help you with this training and they can set up training plans and hopefully they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=32.5s	32.5	 access to some dogs that you can help your dog with rather than relying on friends and family.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 Also, if you or the trainer is going to be doing these exercises,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=43.6s	43.6	 it's a great idea to work on these exercises where the dogs don't actually meet. That's going to create the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 successful training to take the steps slow. In the footage, you will see that my dogs are meeting other dogs very quickly and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 that is because I have assessed the situation and I know that it's an appropriate time where they can meet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 The safest choice if you're not sure how your dog that you're helping is going to react is choosing a calm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=72.5s	72.5	 ignoring dog. What I mean by that is a dog that's calm, friendly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 but they're not wanting to interact with the other dog or they've been trained to ignore the other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=83.3s	83.3	 So a dog that can move calmly and predictably,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=86.6s	86.6	 I'm suggesting a medium-sized adult dog that's going to stand up slowly, lay down slowly, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 and be able to just walk and sniff and you could introduce these dogs at a distance or with just the dog laying down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=101.5s	101.5	 Some dogs do better when the dog is moving slowly through the environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 minding their own business rather than still and laying down facing the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=110.8s	110.8	 It really depends on the dog what makes them more comfortable and more worried or more excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=117.6s	117.6	 So you need to figure that out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 but that's the safest choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=122.7s	122.7	 Sometimes you can see from the dog's behavior as a trainer and you can skip to using different other dogs first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 like I'm going to show in a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=132.7s	132.7	 But if you want to go in order of safety,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=135.7s	135.7	 you can start at a distance with a calm dog and then move on down the line or use multiple calm dogs of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=143.6s	143.6	 different shapes and sizes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=146.1s	146.1	 before moving on to to other categories. At the end of this video,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=150.7s	150.7	 I'm going to include my protocol for working with dogs as decoys and you'll see Splash working as one of those calm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=159.5s	159.5	 ignoring dogs. The next category of dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=163.2s	163.2	 inviting social dogs, dogs that are going to invite the other dog to feel safe to interact with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=170.5s	170.5	 Now there are different personalities that suit different situations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=175.2s	175.2	 but this inviting social dog might not be the first step for a dog that's scared of dogs or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 showing aggression towards dogs because it's hard for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 the first step would be that that dog feels comfortable being ignored by another dog. If they can see that dog has an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=192.7s	192.7	 intention or interest in them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=195.5s	195.5	 in my opinion, I think that that can be harder for a lot of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=199.3s	199.3	 So I would first suggest getting a dog if your dog is fearful, reactive or showing signs of aggression towards other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=207.1s	207.1	 I would first work with a dog that ignores or someone who's feeding the dog, but sometimes dogs are really smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 So they can see that the other dog has intentions of moving towards them and wanting to glance over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=220.5s	220.5	 so get help from a trainer. But in terms of an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=225.3s	225.3	 inviting social dog, I actually have two of them and I love using them with small puppies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=232.3s	232.3	 large breed puppies, to help them learn how to interact with little dogs. My little terrier poodle shih tzu mix, Cloud,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 is actually one of these dogs. He's calm, gentle and inviting, so he's great at building the first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=248.5s	248.5	 foundations of a positive experience with interacting with another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 Another wonderful thing, and I'm going to show you footage of this in a second, is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=258.5s	258.5	 using a dog like Cloud to build a dog that's scared of human beings or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=263.8s	263.8	 worried about approaching them to build their interest and motivation to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 want to interact with human beings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=270.5s	270.5	 Here's some footage of an extremely sweet recently adopted dog named Eddie who's learning to trust human beings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=279.3s	279.3	 His housemate, Sally, is one of those inviting friendly dogs and you can see that by me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=285.3s	285.3	 interacting with the housemate and completely ignoring him besides tossing him some food is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 building his interest in wanting to interact with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=295.3s	295.3	 You can see he's feeling conflicted because he's leaving his back legs behind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=300.3s	300.3	 He also needed to build confidence with putting a leash on and going outside, so I thought I would bring Cloud,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=306.3s	306.3	 my little terrier, to give him an interest in wanting to leave the house on a leash and interact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=312.8s	312.8	 Also, by having an interest and positive experience as soon as he walked out the door, he was able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 be thinking about the leash that was attached to him and we were able to get him into a harness for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=324.6s	324.6	 You can really see a change in his behavior and he's holding his tail higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=328.6s	328.6	 After sniffing around on the front lawn, we were even able to go on a first walk together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=334.6s	334.6	 I believe having the two dogs there for support on his first walk made it a positive experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=340.6s	340.6	 I think he's feeling a little bit better now that he's able to walk on the front lawn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=346.8s	346.8	 Epic, my little five-pound chihuahua, is also one of these inviting friendly dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=352.8s	352.8	 However, even though she's gentle, she can be fast and do erratic movement that can either scare a dog at first or arouse them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=362.8s	362.8	 So if she was working with a puppy and she starts running around crazy in circles and trying to invite them to chase her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=371.2s	371.2	 she can actually do the opposite and get those puppies interested in playing with her like a toy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=379.2s	379.2	 especially because she also doesn't think to correct other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=385.2s	385.2	 So she's a great dog for an extremely shy puppy because you know that if the puppy were to, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=391.2s	391.2	 make that move to interact that she's not going to growl or snap at them even as an adult.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=403.6s	403.6	 Thank you so much for watching. If you'd like to support my work, don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe to my channel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=436.2s	436.2	 For example, your dog might not take treats when out of the house or your dog might be overexcited by treats

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=544.8s	544.8	 With setups, there is less room for errors, it's easier to measure progress,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=550.8s	550.8	 easier to pinpoint triggers that need work, and less stressful for the dog and handler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=557.4s	557.4	 Choose a location with as few distractions as possible to begin with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=563.4s	563.4	 When your dog has mastered setups in non-distracting environments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=567.4s	567.4	 you can practice in busier environments but reduce criteria and expectations when you begin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=573.4s	573.4	 Here is the three-step protocol that I'll go over step by step with examples.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=579.4s	579.4	 The reason that I created this protocol is for those struggling to know when to raise or lower criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=586.1s	586.1	 is that they are not able to do training sessions and struggle to read their dog's body language
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=590.1s	590.1	 and with this protocol, the dog tells you in a very obvious way when to raise and lower criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=596.1s	596.1	 Step 1. Look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=600.1s	600.1	 In this step, you're going to mark the dog for looking at the decoy and feed the dog for looking back at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=606.1s	606.1	 If this is the first time the dog's ever played this game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=610.1s	610.1	 you're going to mark the millisecond that the dog looks at the decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=614.7s	614.7	 You want to mark within two seconds of the dog seeing whatever it is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=618.7s	618.7	 because if you wait too long, what can happen is the dog might get overexcited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=624.7s	624.7	 or react to whatever it is that they're looking at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=628.7s	628.7	 After marking, you're going to feed the dog for looking back at you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=632.7s	632.7	 either feeding the dog to the mouth or putting the treat down on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=636.7s	636.7	 You can also move further away from the decoy to put the food down on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=641.3s	641.3	 By getting your dog to look away from the decoy, it not only gives your dog a short break to calm down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=647.3s	647.3	 but it's also a way to re-present the trigger without having to leave and come back or have the trigger leave and come back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=655.3s	655.3	 Sometimes when a dog is just watching something happen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=659.3s	659.3	 it's almost as though they're watching an action movie and eating popcorn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=663.3s	663.3	 and it's hard to tell if the popcorn or dog treats are creating a conditioned emotional response in the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=670.0s	670.0	 or are simply just a snack to the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=674.0s	674.0	 Step 2. Look and look back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=678.0s	678.0	 After repeating step 1 multiple times where you mark the dog for looking at the decoy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=684.0s	684.0	 now you're going to test the learning and see if the dog has made the connection between the trigger and the reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=690.0s	690.0	 So wait no longer than 4 seconds and see if your dog will think to look back at you for the reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=700.0s	700.0	 This is different from step 1 because instead of marking as the dog looks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=704.0s	704.0	 we are waiting for the dog to look back at us to mark and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=712.0s	712.0	 I suggest feeding the dog while they're still looking back at you so they can enjoy their reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=718.0s	718.0	 and when they're done with the treat, the trigger is re-presented.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=724.0s	724.0	 Step 3. No need to look at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=728.6s	728.6	 Repeat step 1 and 2 with the same setup that's extremely predictable to the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=732.6s	732.6	 until the dog doesn't need to look at the trigger at all and ignores the trigger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=736.6s	736.6	 offering the handler attention or other behaviours in order to gain reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=742.6s	742.6	 such as heel work or sitting or downing or giving eye contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=748.6s	748.6	 or that the dog settles and ignores the trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=753.3s	753.3	 or that the dog can explore the environment with a handler,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=757.3s	757.3	 say for example sniffing trees and walking on a loose leash to explore bushes and the smells in the grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=765.3s	765.3	 If you skip this step and you're not an expert at reading your dog's body language and behaviour,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=771.3s	771.3	 it's hard to know if the dog is ready for the added criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=775.3s	775.3	 and you might inadvertently teach your dog to have to look at whatever it is in the environment constantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=781.9s	781.9	 instead of learn to ignore it like wind in the trees where the dog doesn't need to get excited about it or worry about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=789.9s	789.9	 By getting to the point where the dog can ignore the trigger completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=793.9s	793.9	 and doesn't have to keep looking over every few seconds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=795.9s	795.9	 that tells you that your dog is ready to move on to the next step of adding criteria systematically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=803.9s	803.9	 If the dog achieves step 3, add criteria systematically and return to step 1.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=810.5s	810.5	 If not, reduce criteria and return to step 1.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=816.5s	816.5	 What to do if things go wrong?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=818.5s	818.5	 Now we should plan to have no errors in our training session, but errors happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=822.5s	822.5	 So if the criteria is raised too quickly, use a cue that has been previously trained with positive reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=828.5s	828.5	 to interrupt the dog and then you can either end the session or reduce criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=834.5s	834.5	 Avoid the intentional use of punishment with this method
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=839.2s	839.2	 If the dog is too excited, use the cue that has been previously trained to start to hide his warning signs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=841.2s	841.2	 which makes it hard to read the dog in order to raise and lower criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=845.2s	845.2	 and can inadvertently create a negative emotional response in association with the trigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=853.2s	853.2	 If at any point in the steps, the dog cannot look back after the marker, cannot look down for a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=859.2s	859.2	 suddenly becomes fixated or reacts to the trigger,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=863.8s	863.8	 use the previously trained cue, let's go, and move in the opposite direction until your dog is comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=869.8s	869.8	 Then lower criteria and begin at step 1.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=873.8s	873.8	 If the dog stops taking food or looks overly stressed, end the session and create a new plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=879.8s	879.8	 In this training setup, you can see the dog isn't looking back after the marker and continues to look at the decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=885.8s	885.8	 This means the criteria is too hard for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=890.5s	890.5	 There are many ways to reduce criteria. One could be to do the exercise somewhere else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=894.5s	894.5	 but the other could be to reduce variation in the man's movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=898.5s	898.5	 If the training continued, what could happen is that the dog could feel comfortable at times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=904.5s	904.5	 but then be on edge again if the man did something unexpected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=910.5s	910.5	 In this next setup, the decoy was told to repeat the same movements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=914.5s	914.5	 and even though he's doing a quite fast squat movement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=919.1s	919.1	 it's been reported in the study language that the dog is way more relaxed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=921.1s	921.1	 and can easily look away from him when he's walking around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=925.1s	925.1	 and when he squats, the dog can quickly look away from him for the reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=935.1s	935.1	 Begin with slow, predictable movement or stationary positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=939.1s	939.1	 Increase movement and unpredictability as the learner succeeds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=943.1s	943.1	 Begin with the easiest decoys possible, such as people or dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=947.7s	947.7	 that the dog already trusts and has a relationship with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=951.7s	951.7	 When raising or adding criteria in training setups for emotional and behavioral modification,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=957.7s	957.7	 it's exactly the same as adding criteria for a behavior when training, such as a down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=963.7s	963.7	 So for example, if you were training your dog to stay in the down position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=969.7s	969.7	 there are many aspects that go into that, such as how long the dog can stay in the position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=975.7s	975.7	 how far away they can be from the dog in that position, and can they stay in that position with lots of different variables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=982.4s	982.4	 So instead of trying to work on all of those things at the same time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=986.4s	986.4	 you're going to make it easier for the dog by working on one criterion at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=992.4s	992.4	 So you're teaching your dog to stay in a down stay for duration when there's no distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=998.4s	998.4	 and you're close to your dog, so it's easy for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1003.0s	1003.0	 And then when you start working on distractions, you're not also going to see if your dog can stay in the down stay as long as he can ever stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1011.0s	1011.0	 So when adding criteria, you make sure to drastically reduce everything else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1017.0s	1017.0	 So if something gets harder, everything else gets easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1021.0s	1021.0	 So if you're planning on walking away from your dog and working on your distance from the dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1027.0s	1027.0	 you're not also going to have distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1029.7s	1029.7	 Then when you've worked on the different aspects, you add them all together systematically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1033.7s	1033.7	 So you're not going to add distance, distraction, and duration all at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1039.7s	1039.7	 You might work on one and the other and then work on an average ratio.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1043.7s	1043.7	 So you're not constantly making things harder and harder for the dog by asking for two minutes, then three minutes, then four minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1051.7s	1051.7	 As like a circus comes to town and gets more and more rowdy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1056.3s	1056.3	 you might work on the distractions while the dog is in the down stay get more intense,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1062.3s	1062.3	 while the amount of time the dog stays in the down stay varies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1068.3s	1068.3	 and then the distractions get less intense, and then the dog is also not getting as long duration in the down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1076.3s	1076.3	 So it doesn't just keep getting harder and harder for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1078.3s	1078.3	 So think about this down stay example when planning training setups with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1084.9s	1084.9	 When you work on one piece of the puzzle at a time, one aspect that the dog is reacting to at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1090.9s	1090.9	 Say for example, you have a dog that is fine or okay when dogs are at a distance being calm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1096.9s	1096.9	 but when they're close up and doing something very active, then the dog can overreact in that situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1104.9s	1104.9	 So how you might begin is work on making it the easiest scenario possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1111.6s	1111.6	 where your dog is at a distance they're comfortable from the other dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1115.6s	1115.6	 and the other dog is not moving or doing something very casual.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1119.6s	1119.6	 Sometimes dogs don't like it when other dogs are really still,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1121.6s	1121.6	 but if they were walking around facing the other way sniffing the grass,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1125.6s	1125.6	 maybe that would be less they would be more comfortable with that specific situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1131.6s	1131.6	 So you begin there, and then what you could do is work on the proximity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1135.6s	1135.6	 how close you are to that dog when they're being calm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1139.6s	1139.6	 and then when you work on the dog doing more active behaviors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1142.6s	1142.6	 then you would have the dog as far away as possible, and then add the two together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1146.6s	1146.6	 So you could have the dog doing back flips even or fetching a ball,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1150.6s	1150.6	 or you could work your way up to really excitable behaviors like barking and playing tug with the owner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1156.6s	1156.6	 while your dog is far enough away, and then gradually add the two together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1160.6s	1160.6	 I often get asked, but isn't this going to slow down the training process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1166.6s	1166.6	 by breaking the steps up small and working on one at a time?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1170.6s	1170.6	 It seems like it's going to take forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1172.6s	1172.6	 And the answer is no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1174.6s	1174.6	 Actually, if a dog is, by the dog being able to tell you what they're ready for,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1180.6s	1180.6	 in one training session you could skip right on to meeting the other dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1184.6s	1184.6	 or drastically increasing criteria because the dog is saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1190.6s	1190.6	 yes, that's easy, yes, that's easy, and then you can continue on with the harder tasks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1194.6s	1194.6	 and with a dog that's saying, no, that's not, the wonderful thing about breaking the aspects up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1200.6s	1200.6	 or the triggers up and separating them and looking at them separately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1204.6s	1204.6	 is sometimes you find triggers that you didn't know the dog had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1208.6s	1208.6	 So for example, with one dog, it was the jingling collar that really made them react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1214.6s	1214.6	 So simply by jingling a dog's collar with no dog around, the dog reacted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1218.6s	1218.6	 so the owner could just work on jingling a collar for two weeks in the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1222.6s	1222.6	 before there was even a dog in the picture, and then when the dog was in the picture,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1226.6s	1226.6	 we had an elastic band around the dog's tags.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1230.6s	1230.6	 So I suggest actually with any dog that you begin with the tags silenced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1234.6s	1234.6	 when working with another dog, and then work on the jingle of the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1238.6s	1238.6	 and the noises dogs make separately if those you think might be part of the reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1244.6s	1244.6	 that your dog reacts to other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1246.6s	1246.6	 Before working on the dog's triggers, teach the concept of the jingling collar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1251.6s	1251.6	 and teach the concept of the setup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1254.6s	1254.6	 Teach the concept of the setup without the dog's triggers present
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1257.6s	1257.6	 by using a decoy that your dog likes and trusts, for example, a family member or friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1263.6s	1263.6	 Make sure the dog recognizes them at first so he doesn't get startled by them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1268.6s	1268.6	 Do setups where you rehearse the movements you'll do in the training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1272.6s	1272.6	 with the real triggers until the dog has gotten to the point where he can quickly progress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1276.6s	1276.6	 through the three steps of the protocol for raising criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1280.6s	1280.6	 You can use this as a quick warm-up before a real setup with a decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1285.6s	1285.6	 It's a great test to see if the dog is ready for the training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1288.6s	1288.6	 as the dog might be uninterested in the food or distracted before the trigger is even present.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1294.6s	1294.6	 The reason that it's a good idea to teach the dog the concept of the setup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1298.6s	1298.6	 is that your dog won't be learning something new while also being exposed to the trigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1303.6s	1303.6	 Also, the handler can practice all the different skills and behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1307.6s	1307.6	 they need to do during a real setup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1310.6s	1310.6	 What I usually do is work with my client's dog if he trusts me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1314.6s	1314.6	 and teach the dog the concept of the setup using the client as the decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1320.6s	1320.6	 Most dogs will want to look at their own owner and find it hard to look back at first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1325.6s	1325.6	 so the client can watch the learning process before there is a trigger present.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1330.6s	1330.6	 You will find there are a lot of triggers that you can work on with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1333.6s	1333.6	 before you need to use a strange dog or person as a decoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1337.6s	1337.6	 Most dogs will struggle with looking away from just their own owner running back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1343.6s	1343.6	 The key to this training is creating predictability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1347.6s	1347.6	 So to begin with, I like to work with a very predictable movement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1351.6s	1351.6	 so a movement that repeats every few seconds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1354.6s	1354.6	 or limiting the movement to a specific area that's only about 10 feet wide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1361.6s	1361.6	 Going from step three to step one when something new is added.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1367.6s	1367.6	 In this footage, you can see that Gummy Bear is on step three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1371.6s	1371.6	 where she can easily ignore Splash laying down at a distance from her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1375.6s	1375.6	 However, because we've not worked on Splash getting up after laying down for a long period of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1382.6s	1382.6	 the moment that Splash stands up is when the handler is going to mark Gummy Bear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1387.6s	1387.6	 for looking over at Splash and mark every time that Gummy Bear looks over at Splash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1392.6s	1392.6	 now that she's walking back and forth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1395.6s	1395.6	 because we've never worked on Splash walking back and forth at this distance from Gummy Bear before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1401.6s	1401.6	 After marking Gummy Bear for looking over at Splash multiple times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1406.6s	1406.6	 Joanna is then going to wait and see if Gummy Bear will think to look back at her, and she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1414.6s	1414.6	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1417.6s	1417.6	 If you have a dog that's had extensive training with offering behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1421.6s	1421.6	 and the dog starts to look and look back at you as a behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1425.6s	1425.6	 I suggest waiting and seeing if you can get your dog to look at you with duration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1430.6s	1430.6	 so you don't get that head movement of back and forth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1433.6s	1433.6	 looking at you and looking at whatever it is in the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1436.6s	1436.6	 If this is hard for your dog, I suggest going back to working on a settle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1441.6s	1441.6	 or duration eye contact when there's no trigger around first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1448.6s	1448.6	 Your dog might invent his own way of telling you he's ready for the next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1452.6s	1452.6	 Here Gummy Bear lifts up her chin as if to say this is easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1456.6s	1456.6	 Other dogs might go into a sit position or a down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1459.6s	1459.6	 or any sort of behavior you might have reinforced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1465.6s	1465.6	 Decoy dog tips.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1471.6s	1471.6	 so you can use your body to block the view of the decoy dog's face at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1476.6s	1476.6	 If you're really worried that the decoy dog might look over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1480.6s	1480.6	 you can use healing or luring with a treat on the dog's nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1484.6s	1484.6	 and use high value treats and a high rate of reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1487.6s	1487.6	 to prevent the decoy dog from looking over at the working dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1492.6s	1492.6	 You can use one of your hands as a blocker, as I'm doing here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1495.6s	1495.6	 especially when the dogs are in close proximity to block the view of the decoy dog's eyes from the working dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1501.6s	1501.6	 You can also hold onto the harness and the collar when your hand is in that position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1506.6s	1506.6	 just in case the decoy dog decides to look over at the working dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1510.6s	1510.6	 and that's going to create a setback for the working dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1518.6s	1518.6	 When the working dog is ready to see the decoy dog's face,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1521.6s	1521.6	 you can have them at a 90 degree angle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1524.6s	1524.6	 I like to walk backwards slowly and get my dog to look up at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1530.6s	1530.6	 When the working dog is having success and you want to raise criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1533.6s	1533.6	 and add movement of the working dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1536.6s	1536.6	 I suggest having the decoy dog extremely still or doing extremely predictable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1542.6s	1542.6	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1546.6s	1546.6	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1548.6s	1548.6	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1550.6s	1550.6	 Twirl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1552.6s	1552.6	 If the working dog alerts to the sound of the decoy dog handler's cues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1558.6s	1558.6	 such as the handler telling the dog, the dog is a good boy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1562.6s	1562.6	 or saying something like sit or let's go, or marking and reinforcing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1566.6s	1566.6	 what you can do is first have the handler have no dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1570.6s	1570.6	 and work on all those different cues that are going to be used,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1573.6s	1573.6	 such as sit, down, spin, let's go, marking and reinforcing an invisible dog first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1579.6s	1579.6	 until the working dog can calm down and be comfortable with that scenario first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1584.6s	1584.6	 before bringing the dog into the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1589.6s	1589.6	 Then when the decoy dog is first brought into the picture,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1592.6s	1592.6	 you can use visual cues and luring rather than verbal cues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1598.6s	1598.6	 A very useful behavior is teaching the decoy dog to look at the working dog on cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1606.6s	1606.6	 I suggest treating being looked at as a trigger for any dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1609.6s	1609.6	 and work on it in your training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1622.6s	1622.6	 In most situations, unexpected movement is easier for dogs to handle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1626.6s	1626.6	 when it's further away from them than when it's close up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1629.6s	1629.6	 so work on the trigger of movement at a distance first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1634.6s	1634.6	 Here's an example of keeping notes of your training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1638.6s	1638.6	 You can write down the date, time of day, location, the session duration,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1643.6s	1643.6	 the triggers that were presented, times criteria had to be lowered and why,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1649.6s	1649.6	 other possible contributing factors, and a category for notes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1655.6s	1655.6	 Creating a table like this of all your different training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1658.6s	1658.6	 can really help you plan the next training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1663.6s	1663.6	 I suggest getting help from a professional dog trainer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1666.6s	1666.6	 who doesn't use any sorts of physical or psychological intimidation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1670.6s	1670.6	 to help you with this training, especially trainers who have access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1674.6s	1674.6	 to lots of calm and friendly dogs to use as decoy dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1678.6s	1678.6	 or if your dog has issues with human beings,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1681.6s	1681.6	 you can use the trainer to gather decoy humans to help you with this training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1687.6s	1687.6	 This video was only on the protocol and not on safety,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqZss20TAZo&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=104&pp=iAQB&t=1690.6s	1690.6	 but you can see I'm using a fence, but you can also use muzzles with this exercise.
