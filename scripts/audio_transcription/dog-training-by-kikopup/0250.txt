https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 teaching the puppy to be calm confident and relaxed when handled because most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=11.9s	11.9	 puppies when you reach for them and pet them excitedly or even just pet them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=16.8s	16.8	 calmly it can make the puppy aroused and also want to mouth at your hands or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=21.2s	21.2	 your clothes. Now puppies are very similar to human toddlers in that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=25.9s	25.9	 they're exploring the world using their mouth. Now most toddlers use their hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=30.9s	30.9	 but they also will put things into their mouths and when a puppy sees things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 they're naturally going to want to try putting that thing into their mouth. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 if you reach for your puppy and you're touching your puppy the puppy wants to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=44.4s	44.4	 naturally do the same back to you but they're going to be using their mouth. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=48.8s	48.8	 we need to train the puppies that when we reach and touch them it's not a game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=54.1s	54.1	 of mouthing it's simply that we're petting the dog in order to calm them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=59.7s	59.7	 down or just interact with them in a calm manner. If your puppy started to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 bite at your hands like this I suggest getting your puppy's attention and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 say oh my goodness look what is that and point out a toy that already exists in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=75.7s	75.7	 the environment. So don't get a toy out of a new place like on top of a counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 and give your puppy a toy because they could quickly learn they can get your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 attention by biting you to get access to toys they don't have but I suggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 having some cool toys around that you interact with often that the puppy likes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=94.3s	94.3	 and then get your puppy to play with those toys and interact with those toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 when he's feeling like checking things out in the environment with his mouth or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=103.9s	103.9	 chewing on things. When you first bring your puppy home you want to really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=108.6s	108.6	 create a reinforcement history for playing with his toys right from the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 start. Don't just leave the toys out and hope he'll choose those over your socks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 and shoes or better yet pick up your socks and shoes so your puppy is more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=123.2s	123.2	 likely to spend the day playing with his toys that you want him to play with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 rather than your stuff or your clothes your hair and your hands. So as you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=133.8s	133.8	 see this pup really enjoys playing with his toys. Managing and preventing mouthing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=139.5s	139.5	 and biting. Pet and handle your puppy calmly and gently. Instead of petting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 your puppy excitedly play with a toy with your puppy. Write a list of the times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=149.1s	149.1	 your puppy bites and avoid putting your puppy in those situations unless you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=153.7s	153.7	 plan to train your puppy. If your puppy becomes over excited and mouthy you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 put him in his pen where he can play with his toys. We can teach puppies what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=163.2s	163.2	 to do when being petted, handled and groomed by setting up short training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 sessions. You can use a portion of your puppy's breakfast and dinner to work on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 handling exercises and I suggest working on them daily when you first get your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=176.9s	176.9	 puppy. Step one touch and feed a treat at the same time. The reason that you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=184.8s	184.8	 to feed and touch at the same time is that if you have a mouthy puppy and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=188.9s	188.9	 just reach for your puppy your puppy might either lick or bite at your hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 as you're reaching for your puppy or if you have a timid puppy you reach for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=196.9s	196.9	 your puppy and your puppy might back away and that's not the first thing you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=200.2s	200.2	 want your puppy to do when you reach for them in a training session. So I suggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=204.8s	204.8	 starting out every training session by feeding and touching at the same time. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 if you're going to be touching your puppy's feet you touch and feed at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=212.8s	212.8	 same time. Practice touching the top of the head and you're doing this all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 calmly so the puppy isn't finding it overwhelming at first. So now I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 touching on the back of his shoulders like this and feeding and then once
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=225.5s	225.5	 you've done that and your puppy is seeming pretty contented to get his treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 while you touch him at the same time you can move on to the next step which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 making the petting the predictor of food because at the first step you're simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=238.4s	238.4	 teaching him what's going to happen to him while he's not doing anything and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=243.2s	243.2	 then the second step is teaching him that the actual petting is what predicts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=247.9s	247.9	 that the food is going to come. Step two, touch your puppy say good or click and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=253.4s	253.4	 then move to feed a treat. So I'm going to touch him say good and then give him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=261.1s	261.1	 a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=269.1s	269.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=273.7s	273.7	 Good. Once your puppy is calm and relaxed with you placing your hand on your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 you can also practice stroking gestures. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=291.8s	291.8	 Good. Step three, add duration to the handling and teach the puppy to ignore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=299.9s	299.9	 the treats. The third step you might not actually get to in the first few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=304.3s	304.3	 training sessions because it requires a couple of other skills to be taught to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=308.4s	308.4	 the puppy. One, either that the puppy can look away from treats that you're holding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 like that. Good. Or that your puppy can offer you eye contact or at least look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=318.3s	318.3	 up at you when you make a kissy noise or an attention noise. Good. Like that and I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=323.1s	323.1	 did not know that he would do all that so perfectly. You're so clever. Okay so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=328.1s	328.1	 after doing step two where you reach, mark, good and then feed you can start to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=334.7s	334.7	 wait until your puppy offers you eye contact or doesn't look at the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=338.3s	338.3	 because you don't want your puppy to only think that handling is okay if he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 looking at food because when the food becomes out of the picture then suddenly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 you might get the mouthing and biting or over excitement with handling again. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 So you reach, touch your puppy calmly and wait for your puppy to stop looking at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=358.5s	358.5	 the food or look up at your eyes and if that doesn't happen within two to three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=362.3s	362.3	 seconds you can make your attention noise or say your puppy's name if that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=366.1s	366.1	 his cue to look at you. Good. Now when I make my attention noise and my puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=374.5s	374.5	 doesn't look I make a little blowing noise like a breathing noise like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=379.6s	379.6	 Good. And then I mark it and then go to feed a treat. You want to make sure when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=384.6s	384.6	 you mark your puppy for calm behaviors like handling that you don't race to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=389.1s	389.1	 get that treat into the picture because what you can create is a puppy that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=393.5s	393.5	 getting excited about the treat coming so you want to mark, pause and then feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=398.8s	398.8	 the treat. Step four, keep changing the picture. Practice these handling exercises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=405.5s	405.5	 while the puppy is sitting, standing, laying down as well as while you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=409.8s	409.8	 standing above the puppy or to the side of the puppy. It's really important that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=415.5s	415.5	 during this training you handle your puppy calmly however you should do some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=420.6s	420.6	 training sessions where you simulate what other people might do to your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=425.2s	425.2	 before you can tell the person that that's not an appropriate way to pet a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=429.3s	429.3	 puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=436.2s	436.2	 If your puppy opens his mouth, gets excited, leans away or backs away go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=442.2s	442.2	 to step one where you touch and feed at the same time. If your puppy is still too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=447.1s	447.1	 excited then stop training and wait until another time to train when he is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=451.1s	451.1	 calm. Here you can see my puppy ducks when I tried to touch him on the head so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=456.6s	456.6	 I go back to step one of touching and feeding at the same time. If you have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=461.8s	461.8	 puppy that leans away or backs away from you when you try to touch him you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=466.2s	466.2	 play this game as the first step where you move away from your puppy and to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=470.7s	470.7	 reach the treat the puppy's face rubs against your hand to get the treat in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=475.1s	475.1	 your hand so you can hold your hand under his chin as he reaches for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=479.2s	479.2	 treat or have your hand above his head then you can turn it into a petting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkHuLK5UyAI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=251&pp=iAQB&t=484.2s	484.2	 gesture and start to pet him before you give him the treat.
