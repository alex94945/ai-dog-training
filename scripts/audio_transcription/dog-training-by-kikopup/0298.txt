https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, today I'm going to show you how you can line your dogs up in a row for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=4.4s	4.4	 their picture or for a video or to have a selfie with you without having to physically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 manipulate and push and shove your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=12.2s	12.2	 Now I've seen even the most positive trainer in the rush to get a picture with their dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=16.7s	16.7	 pushing and shoving their dog and it's simply not necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=19.7s	19.7	 There's a much faster way to get your dog lined up and it's very simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=23.5s	23.5	 It's teaching the obedience left hand finish and using that cue to get your dog into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 position next to you on your left, your right, maybe between your legs or next to another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=33.2s	33.2	 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 Are you ready, Wishy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=35.5s	35.5	 So it's a very simple trick to train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 If you already have a verbal cue for a left hand finish, you can start using that and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 retrain it with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=43.9s	43.9	 Now the very important thing is though, is that when you're working with multiple dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 you want to make sure that they're comfortable being near each other before you lower them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 into each other's face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=55.4s	55.4	 Now if you're not sure if your dog's comfortable with each other or comfortable taking food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=59.7s	59.7	 toys or having attention from you while next to each other, you want to seek advice from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=64.7s	64.7	 a professional trainer to make sure you're not going to cause a dog fight by pushing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=70.6s	70.6	 your dogs into a space that they're uncomfortable being in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=74.4s	74.4	 Now my dogs have worked for, well for Wishy since she was a puppy, to be comfortable around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 my other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=81.8s	81.8	 And one of the warning signs that you can tell that your dogs are feeling uncomfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=84.9s	84.9	 is that when they're near each other, they might be putting their ears back or putting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 their ears in a different position than when they're normally relaxed or perky when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 expecting a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=95.1s	95.1	 You can tell if they're shifting their eyes around, if they're blinking a lot, if they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=99.8s	99.8	 are panting and then suddenly they stop panting, if they get very stiff, if they're leaning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 away from each other or if they're constantly licking their lips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 So you'll see some mild signs of discomfort if you haven't trained this before and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=116.1s	116.1	 key is keeping enough distance from the dogs until they're comfortable to be near each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 But this is a much better technique than forcefully manipulating them into positions if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=127.4s	127.4	 going to be taking pictures of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 So you can use luring or simply hand targeting and you're going to lure your dog far behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=138.4s	138.4	 you as far as you can reach, click and treat and then lure them back and click when their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=144.4s	144.4	 butt lines up with your side and then lure them to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 So once they've got those three behaviors down, you can turn it into a behavior chain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=157.4s	157.4	 where you lure them behind you, pull them forwards and then lure them up to sit like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 So every time you lure your dog, you want to make sure to give them the treat because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 they are following the lure even if they're not straight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 So if their butt's sticking out to the side, give them the treat and then the next time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=177.4s	177.4	 figure out how to get their butt straight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fgHh7TuH0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=299&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 them to sit like that.
