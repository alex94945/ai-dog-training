https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, I'm going to be doing a real-time training session with my little puppy Cloud here on proofing the stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 So what I'm going to be doing today is working on the reliability of the release cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 So working on stimulus control of the cue that means to get up. Now I have a video that's pretty old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 It's from 2010 and it's called stay using the KikoPup method and part of that method is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=27.1s	27.1	 Really building stimulus control on the release cue because if the dog doesn't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 Reliably to get up exactly when you see the release it can really make the behavior confusing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=38.9s	38.9	 And also by teaching a behavior that ends another behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 Can make it really easy to add duration and there's actually this really amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 By one of my favorite all-time trainers and teachers Mary Hunter and I'll link that in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=57.9s	57.9	 That goes over how you can increase duration without causing frustration or confusion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 By having an end behavior. So I'll link that in the description below and it has video examples as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=72.1s	72.1	 So the concept of the stay is keep laying down until I say you can get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 So if the dog doesn't understand the concept of the cue to get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 Then the stay can be very confusing when you start to add duration and distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 And so what we're teaching the dog is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=90.2s	90.2	 The cue to get up is what they're waiting for and if they're not getting up on that cue then there is confusion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=96.9s	96.9	 So first with him, I'm gonna first see if he is reliably getting up on the cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=103.1s	103.1	 Which is free and then if he is getting up on the cue free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=107.1s	107.1	 I can start proofing the release cue with other distractions and other words
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 But first we need to get that when I say the cue f-r-e-e which means to get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=117.6s	117.6	 He does it within a second or or faster. So here we go. I'm gonna ask him to down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=125.5s	125.5	 Good boy, and now I'm gonna say free without moving free and because he didn't get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 I'm gonna then lure him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=133.5s	133.5	 So basically what I want to teach him is that when he's laying down like that and I say free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=139.7s	139.7	 it's then gonna predict my movement to get him up a mark and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=145.1s	145.1	 Reinforce for moving towards me. So now I'm gonna ask him to lay down again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=152.7s	152.7	 Good and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=155.7s	155.7	 We obviously have some work to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=157.8s	157.8	 Free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=160.1s	160.1	 Because you see he doesn't know to get up yet get it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=164.4s	164.4	 Also, I think that he's not finding these treats that reinforcing so I'm gonna try some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 Some other treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=173.1s	173.1	 now I have this cooked ground turkeys treats and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 Because it's much higher value than the other treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 I have a feeling he's gonna want to move towards me and at first I can mark that behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 So that I'm getting that behavior of him moving towards me and then I can see if when I say free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=190.9s	190.9	 He's gonna want to move towards me because I have better treats and before he was laying there thinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=195.5s	195.5	 It's not worth the energy to get up to you because I rather just stay laying down here and have you feed me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=203.2s	203.2	 Okay, so he's in the down position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 Good, then I'm gonna stand really still. He's already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=210.9s	210.9	 anticipating being released down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=220.7s	220.7	 Now I'm having the opposite problem because the treats are too good so finding like a middle ground with the treats can be helpful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=227.7s	227.7	 Where it's not too exciting that they're popping up and not too boring that that they don't find it reinforcing to get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 So here I'm just gonna reinforce the down a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=237.8s	237.8	 so basically down and release are like yin and yang if one is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=244.4s	244.4	 Reinforced too much. They're gonna want to keep doing that and when the other is reinforced too much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=248.9s	248.9	 They want to they're gonna want to keep getting up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 So they'll either want to stay or get up so you have to kind of find a balance between the two so now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=256.9s	256.9	 Ready down good down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 That was adorable so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=264.5s	264.5	 Basically because he started getting up for the high level reinforcement. I'm just gonna mark and reinforce multiple times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=271.4s	271.4	 Basically change my training plan mid training session and work on him just staying in the down position first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=280.1s	280.1	 Free good boy. He said I can jump up like like popcorn for those treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=287.5s	287.5	 Good so I'm gonna mark and reinforce multiple times for him staying down like that and then I'm gonna say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=297.3s	297.3	 And I like that I like that him getting up so quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 Down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=305.4s	305.4	 He said it's harder to lay down though, I've never laid down for such an exciting treat before ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=314.6s	314.6	 So I'm gonna go back a step lower him with the food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 Highly reinforce him free cue the free behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 Good job, and then ask him to go down again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=329.1s	329.1	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=332.3s	332.3	 Good boy, that's what I like to see good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 whoop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=338.2s	338.2	 So now I'm gonna cue him down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=340.9s	340.9	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=342.3s	342.3	 So I've loaded my hand with some more treats and now we're gonna do a little proofing game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=347.5s	347.5	 Down where I'm gonna say different words that aren't thoroughly skew and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=352.9s	352.9	 Reinforce him as I say them so I can say frisbee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=357.7s	357.7	 Curtains
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=360.5s	360.5	 Shoes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 Wardrobe I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 Usually get like really really uncreative and then just say what I can see in the room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=372.2s	372.2	 Carpet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 Chihuahua time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 Little puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 Hello
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=383.7s	383.7	 Whoa there so if he gets up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 I'm gonna lure him back into the down position and there's a ton of crumbs that he wants on the carpet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=392.1s	392.1	 Which are another distraction his legs are so short
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=395.9s	395.9	 It's hard to lure him from a sit into a down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=399.8s	399.8	 There we go. I took the treat away and then I'm gonna give him back give it back to him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 I am gonna get a little closer so I can drop them right between his paws like that apples good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=414.0s	414.0	 Socks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=415.1s	415.1	 Good and now I'm gonna say the cue free and most likely the first time you ever play this game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=420.6s	420.6	 Your dog's not gonna get up on the cue and so you can encourage them up and then mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=426.6s	426.6	 So now I'm gonna say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=429.8s	429.8	 Hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=431.2s	431.2	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=432.6s	432.6	 He and it's gonna take a couple of training sessions for them to get this concept
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=439.2s	439.2	 Good this is epic my one year old Chihuahua
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=442.4s	442.4	 And we're gonna work on the release cue get it which means to get up out of the stay position and get something else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=448.8s	448.8	 So I usually say get it and then point at what I want the dog to get so first you can teach the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=455.2s	455.2	 To stay where they are while you move the disc around or the bowl of the bowl that you're gonna put the treats in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=462.8s	462.8	 Or if you just put the treat on the ground you can work on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=466.9s	466.9	 So I'm just working on putting this down on the ground without her getting up now if she were to get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=475.9s	475.9	 Like that I'm just gonna go and lure her back into the sit position and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=481.2s	481.2	 Then make it a little bit easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=483.6s	483.6	 Good job, so I might have someone else hold the bowl further away and put it down like that. I can also release her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=491.9s	491.9	 Epic free good and then let her go check the bowl out and see that nothing comes of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=499.3s	499.3	 Ask her to sit and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=501.4s	501.4	 Then I'm what I'm doing is reinforcing her for staying and feeding her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=506.9s	506.9	 For staying when she sees this move good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=510.4s	510.4	 You could even add eye contact and it's a little cold in here. So that's why she's shivering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=515.8s	515.8	 Being that she's a little Chihuahua
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=521.5s	521.5	 She said how about waving is that gonna do something so I can just wait a little bit and move and make it a little easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=528.5s	528.5	 And move that object and just ignore the waving for the moment if the waving kept coming back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=533.8s	533.8	 I could take the dish away and just work on the stay with duration to get rid of that behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=540.6s	540.6	 Now what I'm gonna do is place a treat onto the onto the dish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=546.2s	546.2	 But I'm not just gonna put it down because she most likely will just get up like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=550.5s	550.5	 So I'm lowering the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=552.8s	552.8	 She said I'll get up anyway, so I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=555.9s	555.9	 Haven't really proofed stays with her because she's so small that I rather have her with me all the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=561.8s	561.8	 And if I have her staying she's usually in one of her crates or something. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=567.8s	567.8	 That's a terrible excuse. But anyway, look at me. I'm working on it. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=572.4s	572.4	 So here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=573.3s	573.3	 I'm moving the tree down like that and marking her for the absence of getting up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=578.3s	578.3	 So if she does get up, I'm just gonna bring my hand back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=581.3s	581.3	 Wait for her to stay again and then go and touch the plate and bring it back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=585.9s	585.9	 Another thing you can do is just keep repeating the gesture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=589.6s	589.6	 She's like, where's that treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=593.2s	593.2	 It should be right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=596.8s	596.8	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=598.0s	598.0	 So there's no harm in the dog not knowing what you want from them. They're not being disobedient or stupid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=603.8s	603.8	 They're trying to figure out what you want them to do and it really is not making sense to her right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=608.8s	608.8	 So she understands this this behavior and we're going back a step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=613.6s	613.6	 So she has no idea really what I want her to do and I've used the same disk for teaching her other things like targeting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=620.0s	620.0	 So now she's doing really good. I'm gonna put the treat down like that if she thinks to get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=624.7s	624.7	 I'm just gonna lure her back into the sit position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=628.0s	628.0	 highly reinforce her like this and then if she thinks to get up I can just quickly take it away and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=633.4s	633.4	 It's much easier if the the bowl is at a distance and someone else is handling it so you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=640.2s	640.2	 Make the dog frustrated or stressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=644.3s	644.3	 Good the next step is dropping a treat and leaving it there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=649.4s	649.4	 Marking and reinforcing and now I'm going to release her to the treat. Are you ready? Get it. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=655.9s	655.9	 So that's essentially how to train the behavior of get it and that can really increase the duration of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=662.7s	662.7	 Stay because it's a very very obvious behavior that they're going to do and they love doing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=668.6s	668.6	 Which is moving over and enjoying the treat that they can see and go get ready get it. Good boy girl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=677.7s	677.7	 You can also practice with different positions like a stand or a sit using this method
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=684.3s	684.3	 You can also have the dish in different locations to work on the dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=689.1s	689.1	 Understanding of the behavior that the only way they can get the treats on the plate is when you say get it ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=696.9s	696.9	 epic get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=700.1s	700.1	 Get it and if they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=702.7s	702.7	 Reluctant to get it because you've reinforced them for not getting it and they might think it's a leave it exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=708.1s	708.1	 I like to make a little hunts all in gradual trail of treats to the plate and point at point at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=715.9s	715.9	 Reinforcers and say get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=718.0s	718.0	 There we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=720.0s	720.0	 Get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=721.5s	721.5	 Good good girl. I keep wanting to call her a boy. It's because I have a little male puppy twirl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=729.6s	729.6	 Good you can also ask for some of their favorite behaviors

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjoECGMUZw0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=111&pp=iAQB&t=784.3s	784.3	 So you say the cue free and then you move and invite the dog up mark and reinforce and you can reinforce
