https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, we're on safari in South Africa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=3.0s	3.0	 A lot of people don't know that I'm actually South African
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 and that's one of the main reasons I became so obsessed with animal behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 even when I was a little kid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=11.4s	11.4	 So now I'm more interested in domesticated dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 but I still get very very excited about watching animals in the real wild.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=19.6s	19.6	 We're staying in this really awesome tent in Enselweene Lodge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=23.5s	23.5	 and it's got... it's very modern looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 so it's very comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 but it's also got aspects of how you would stay in a tent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 So the roof is tent and the rest is very luxurious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=39.1s	39.1	 but the only thing keeping you from the animals is this glass door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 and that wall, it's a tent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=45.6s	45.6	 And I believe at the lodge down the road
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=48.6s	48.6	 there's some lions so we're going to go check that out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=76.7s	76.7	 There are lions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=86.9s	86.9	 They're getting closer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=88.9s	88.9	 That man is so scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=90.9s	90.9	 It's about 20 feet away from us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=104.9s	104.9	 I also brought along my parents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=106.9s	106.9	 So it's been really fun to travel with my parents in the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=110.9s	110.9	 Like old times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=112.9s	112.9	 Like old times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=125.9s	125.9	 Martina just spotted a rhino. It's right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 Here's some baby hyenas that are sleeping and waiting for their parents to return.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=142.9s	142.9	 Actually that was only muertee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=169.9s	169.9	 Hello!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=177.9s	177.9	 and we saw two prides of lions, which was really exciting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=181.9s	181.9	 and some water buffalo, and of course my favorite is the warthog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=187.9s	187.9	 so a lot of people just drive on by, but I think that they're the coolest of all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 And this morning we saw two baby hyena.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=232.9s	232.9	 I think we should get back in the car, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rILvuvDQuY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=377&pp=iAQB&t=234.9s	234.9	 Now we're just going on a walk through the bush.
