https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone, this is a trick video on how to teach your dog to jump over your arms as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 if they're hurdles as they go in a circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=12.5s	12.5	 So Bliss, my border collie mix, he's just over one year old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 He turned one a few months ago and I did check his hips and he's got fair hips for a border
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 collie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=26.4s	26.4	 But I had him down as a border collie on the test, but he's actually a mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=32.1s	32.1	 He's a border collie mixed with Cattle Dog and it also says he has some German Shepherd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=36.6s	36.6	 and Rottweiler in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=38.2s	38.2	 And I'm guessing the Rottweiler is why he's such a goofy, friendly, sweet boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 Yeah, so I'm so glad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=45.7s	45.7	 He's the perfect, perfect dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=47.9s	47.9	 Perfect mix for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 He's just Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=51.9s	51.9	 Perfect, perfect service dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 However, he is Mr. Slow and Steady.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=57.9s	57.9	 He's not like as whip-lash-fast as the other dogs and because he has fair hips, I'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 going to be making him jump, do lots of jumping tricks and agility and stuff like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=69.1s	69.1	 He could, fair isn't so bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=71.3s	71.3	 But for teaching the hurdles, I'm going to keep the hurdles down low, but initially to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 train them, he's only going to be jumping as high as his ankles, so I'm going to use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 a pole to teach him to jump over the pole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=83.7s	83.7	 And this is a great way to initially start working on teaching jumping tricks, especially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=89.3s	89.3	 if you're not very mobile because then you don't have to run around and move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=95.5s	95.5	 You could use a hurdle with like a wall with a barrier to initially train the dog to jump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=101.5s	101.5	 over the hurdle back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=103.6s	103.6	 And I do have a really cool beginning agility for fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=109.1s	109.1	 I'm not an expert at agility, only agility for fun, so I do have some links to proper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=119.1s	119.1	 agility videos, getting started with agility, but this is agility for fun and there's examples
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 of jumping over hurdles rather than teaching the dog to jump over your arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=127.9s	127.9	 Okay, so we'll get started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=129.5s	129.5	 So you first, with this trick, have to teach some initial behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=133.5s	133.5	 Oh, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=134.5s	134.5	 He thinks he's still doing the settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=137.5s	137.5	 So you want to teach your dog to go in a circle around you to the left and the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=140.9s	140.9	 And this is a great game to stimulate your dog's, you know, physical and mental stimulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 So like with a border collie or a fast moving breed, teaching them to walk around you first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 You can have two speeds, walking around you and also running around you, but eventually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=156.8s	156.8	 they're going to be moving fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=159.1s	159.1	 If you have one of those dogs that are slow and steady like this boy and your tricks look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=164.8s	164.8	 kind of slow or you want to impress someone with the dog's speed, if a dog is jumping,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 they immediately look active.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=174.5s	174.5	 When they do the jump, they're going to move fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=176.9s	176.9	 So adding a little jump into a trick routine can make your dog look more flashy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 So if you're, if you, you might not even have a trick routine, but it's a, it's a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 way to add variety to your dog's life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=193.7s	193.7	 And that's really going to improve their quality of life doing fun things with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 He's like, give me the treats already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=200.2s	200.2	 So I have easy to throw treats that aren't messy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 They're kibble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=204.8s	204.8	 You could use round freeze dry treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=207.1s	207.1	 I have some over there, but he really likes this kibble because I don't, I don't feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=211.1s	211.1	 them kibble for food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=212.4s	212.4	 So kibble is like very exciting to them and I can't, I can't see you because he's very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 excited about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 So I put the bowl of food down in between my legs like this so that a treat bag isn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=225.7s	225.7	 going to get in the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=227.4s	227.4	 And I'm just going to throw a treat behind me and then put another treat down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 And you can initially train it with clicker training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=235.4s	235.4	 So you throw the treat behind you and then you're picking the dog up on the other side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=239.8s	239.8	 and you're clicking the movement and you're feeding in the direction the dog's going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=244.5s	244.5	 That's what I learned from Bob Bailey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 You click the movement that the dog is going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 If you want an active dog, you're clicking moving and then you feed them just a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=253.6s	253.6	 bit ahead of you, ahead of where you clicked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=256.1s	256.1	 So you don't have a dog that's walking and stopping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=258.6s	258.6	 There's like a beautiful fluid movement and then you just keep doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=263.3s	263.3	 You don't even need to mark it first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=265.1s	265.1	 You can just be feeding them in a circle like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 And I would suggest to go both ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=270.6s	270.6	 So if you have the dog go this way and then they come back around the front, just lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=276.6s	276.6	 them further back behind you before picking them up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=279.4s	279.4	 And you can do it with two hands or one hand as I'm doing right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=283.5s	283.5	 Okay, then you can add a cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=285.8s	285.8	 So mine is for this direction is go circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=289.8s	289.8	 And I actually only have the hurdles in one direction and do jumping tricks in the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 direction turning because I don't want to have confusion with the human and dog and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=302.5s	302.5	 have the dog jump in my face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=304.3s	304.3	 In fact, I did have a halo jump in my face a few months ago and it really damaged my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=314.7s	314.7	 And so for two weeks I had a really messed up mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=317.7s	317.7	 It looked like a dog bit me in the face because literally he jumped right into my face because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 we were working on jump trick the other direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=326.6s	326.6	 And so I was leaning the wrong way and he jumped right in my face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=330.8s	330.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=332.0s	332.0	 So yes, be careful with jumping tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=334.3s	334.3	 They can hurt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 So as the dog is going to be jumping in the future, you're going to lean your head way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=338.3s	338.3	 out of the way if they're jumping over your arms and be careful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=342.5s	342.5	 If you ever do a jumping trick, go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=345.2s	345.2	 Where your dog is jumping through your arms like this and you don't see the dog, turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=349.5s	349.5	 around and look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=350.9s	350.9	 Don't look through the hoop because I've done that and it hurts when they jump into your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=355.7s	355.7	 face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=356.7s	356.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 So he's going round and round and then we're going to go the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 This is a great trick for older dogs too to keep them active and engaged is walking in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=368.8s	368.8	 a circle around you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=370.4s	370.4	 Get it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=371.4s	371.4	 Especially if you had a dog that had some injury and they're just allowed to walk, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=376.5s	376.5	 could do the slow walking around you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=379.7s	379.7	 You can add speed and enthusiasm later and with the jumps that's going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=383.8s	383.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=384.8s	384.8	 So this is the other direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=385.8s	385.8	 I don't want to confuse him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=386.8s	386.8	 But you want to work on both directions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=389.2s	389.2	 But if you're just about to work on the jumping trick, I would suggest just working on one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=393.4s	393.4	 direction a few days in a row before then adding the jump in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 So you can add the verbal cue and mine is go circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=401.3s	401.3	 So you say go circle and then you lure the dog behind you, mark and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=406.5s	406.5	 I don't know why he shook his head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=408.6s	408.6	 I hope it wasn't because of the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=410.4s	410.4	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=411.4s	411.4	 So my clicker is muffled with a piece of poster tack but you can use a marker word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=416.8s	416.8	 If you have a really loud clicker and you click that close to the dog's ear, it's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=420.8s	420.8	 to hurt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=421.8s	421.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=422.8s	422.8	 So when I get to the point of having the hurdles out, I'm not going to use the clicker just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=428.3s	428.3	 because it's harder to hold and I'm going to use a marker word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=431.2s	431.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=432.2s	432.2	 So I'm going to say go circle and give him a gesture like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=437.1s	437.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=438.1s	438.1	 Go circle and make it easier with the gesture because he's not getting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=442.6s	442.6	 He's just shaking his head because he has something in his ear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=446.7s	446.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=447.7s	447.7	 So now I'm going to say go circle and not move because we worked on this and he actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=451.3s	451.3	 has, he does know, oh no, he's going to settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=454.9s	454.9	 So if your dog settles down while you're working, you can just toss a treat to reset them and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=460.7s	460.7	 then, because they don't know what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=463.1s	463.1	 So it's much better when your dog says, I don't know what to do, I'll lay down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=467.0s	467.0	 Much better than I don't know what to do, I'll bark at you or paw at you or jump and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=471.5s	471.5	 bite your face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=472.5s	472.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=473.5s	473.5	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=474.5s	474.5	 Go circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=476.2s	476.2	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=477.2s	477.2	 Woo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=478.2s	478.2	 So you can also build in the enthusiasm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=481.8s	481.8	 Go circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=483.4s	483.4	 If you throw the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=484.4s	484.4	 Woohoo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=485.4s	485.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=486.4s	486.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=487.4s	487.4	 Hee hee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=488.4s	488.4	 There it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=489.4s	489.4	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=490.4s	490.4	 Woohoo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=491.4s	491.4	 And you can see, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=492.4s	492.4	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=493.4s	493.4	 That got him a little bit more excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=495.2s	495.2	 But I don't want him too excited because I want a really nice, precise behavior and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=499.7s	499.7	 I'm going to add the speed because if you get fast and sloppy and then you try to add
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=505.0s	505.0	 duration of jumps or behaviors, you can get frustration, barking and whining or over-excitement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=514.5s	514.5	 and things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=516.0s	516.0	 So and in precise behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=518.7s	518.7	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=519.7s	519.7	 So now we worked on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=520.7s	520.7	 I'm actually going to use poles, but you could lure your dog over your arm if you want to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=524.2s	524.2	 but poles make it way easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=526.5s	526.5	 So I'm going to go get those poles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=528.5s	528.5	 I'm going to use one pole at first and actually this is the same pole that I use as a target
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=533.5s	533.5	 So it might be a little confusing for him, but it is just a pole that I got from Home Depot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=539.5s	539.5	 and I'm going to lay it on my body and either block it against the wall so he has to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=544.7s	544.7	 over it in order to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=547.0s	547.0	 If he doesn't want to, he doesn't have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=550.0s	550.0	 But I'm going to throw it over like that and I'm going to shorten the pole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=553.0s	553.0	 So he's just going over one jump right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=555.0s	555.0	 We'll get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=556.0s	556.0	 And my cue for jump is Hup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=558.0s	558.0	 I have a whole bunch of other words like jump means jump in front of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=563.6s	563.6	 So he just kicked into the pole.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=567.8s	567.8	 But that's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=568.8s	568.8	 At first you're just reinforcing and marking him for going over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=572.3s	572.3	 So you're going to click as the dog goes over, say yes, and then feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=578.2s	578.2	 So I'm going to add in the cue which is Hup and then feed a treat behind me, feed a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=584.7s	584.7	 for coming forward, and then eventually Hup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=587.7s	587.7	 I'm going to see if I can just feed him over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=590.9s	590.9	 Woohoo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=592.6s	592.6	 When you add in the two jumps, and I wonder if he'll jump over this, I might have to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=596.4s	596.4	 the two sticks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=597.9s	597.9	 But I'm going to lure him over this jump, get it, and then lure him over this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=606.4s	606.4	 Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=607.4s	607.4	 I do need the longer sticks because he needs more room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=611.0s	611.0	 With my smaller dogs, they can go just right behind me and then have enough room to jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=616.4s	616.4	 But he needs more room to jump so I'm going to move on to the next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=621.6s	621.6	 As you see, I've situated myself in a corner so he can't go around the poles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=629.5s	629.5	 I've got both poles against the corner and so he's just learning to go over here to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=635.7s	635.7	 the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=636.7s	636.7	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=637.7s	637.7	 And then over there to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=639.7s	639.7	 I can start tossing them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=640.8s	640.8	 I can just say, get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=642.8s	642.8	 Woohoo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=643.8s	643.8	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=644.8s	644.8	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=645.8s	645.8	 I'm going to put my clicker away because I need both my hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=648.5s	648.5	 I'm going to be quiet for a second so that you can see actual training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=651.5s	651.5	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=652.5s	652.5	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=653.5s	653.5	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=654.5s	654.5	 I picked him up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=655.5s	655.5	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=656.5s	656.5	 I'm not going to shut up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=657.5s	657.5	 I'm going to pick him up with the other hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=659.1s	659.1	 So I throw this and as he's eating that, I pick him up with the other hand like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=662.9s	662.9	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=663.9s	663.9	 Go get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=664.9s	664.9	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=665.9s	665.9	 Go get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=667.6s	667.6	 And then that can turn into luring gestures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=670.8s	670.8	 So I'm going to say, go!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=672.3s	672.3	 Go hop!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=673.3s	673.3	 Or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=674.3s	674.3	 Hop!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=675.3s	675.3	 Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=676.3s	676.3	 Ready?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=679.6s	679.6	 Another thing you can do is start practicing holding it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=683.8s	683.8	 So the dog is learning to jump over your arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=687.2s	687.2	 So you can point in the direction you want your dog to jump over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=691.7s	691.7	 And lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=693.0s	693.0	 So this is how I initially train it myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=695.3s	695.3	 Is that I'm holding my arm out like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=698.3s	698.3	 And then I point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=699.3s	699.3	 Go hop!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=701.3s	701.3	 And then with this hand, hop!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=704.3s	704.3	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=705.3s	705.3	 Ready?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=712.4s	712.4	 Whoops, I threw a whole bunch of treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=717.6s	717.6	 You want to throw the treat far enough that it's further away from you that the dog's,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=722.8s	722.8	 at least the dog's body, can jump over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=725.8s	725.8	 Otherwise your dog isn't going to be able to jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=727.9s	727.9	 They'll have to do a handstand in order to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=730.7s	730.7	 So if I drop the treat over here, you can see it's not a good idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=735.9s	735.9	 He's going to jump and kick into that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=738.2s	738.2	 So having enough room for your dog's body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=741.7s	741.7	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=742.7s	742.7	 Hop!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=743.7s	743.7	 That they can do a nice jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=746.6s	746.6	 Woo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=747.6s	747.6	 Okay, I'm going to hold the poles a little higher now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=753.4s	753.4	 Because he's an adult.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=755.8s	755.8	 Almost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=756.8s	756.8	 Almost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=757.8s	757.8	 Okay, ready?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=760.8s	760.8	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=761.8s	761.8	 Hop!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=762.8s	762.8	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=764.7s	764.7	 If he hits the poles, no big deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=766.6s	766.6	 As long as he's not hurting himself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=769.2s	769.2	 And I've got a non-slip surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=771.2s	771.2	 The best surface is grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=774.2s	774.2	 This isn't the most non-slip surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=776.3s	776.3	 It is carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=777.3s	777.3	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=778.3s	778.3	 Now, if the dog is going super slow like this, it's going to be harder to do a nice jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=782.8s	782.8	 So we will add the beautiful jumps in the future with toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=786.6s	786.6	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=787.9s	787.9	 And with a bigger circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=789.4s	789.4	 Okay, so I'm working on two criteria at the moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=793.9s	793.9	 One is getting the poles higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=796.9s	796.9	 The other is incorporating my arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=799.4s	799.4	 And then a third thing that I will do is reduce how many treats I give in the future so he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=804.5s	804.5	 does more jumps for, like goes around and around for less treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=809.6s	809.6	 Okay, so, because it will look not as cool if you're like tossing a treat after every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=816.2s	816.2	 jump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=817.2s	817.2	 It's not a smooth, beautiful movement as you saw in the beginning clips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=820.5s	820.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=821.5s	821.5	 So I'm going to practice with my arm there again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=823.6s	823.6	 In fact, I might even practice without the poles to show you that example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=828.4s	828.4	 So without the poles, I'm going to go back and make it super easy and say go, hup!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=832.7s	832.7	 Good!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=834.7s	834.7	 Yes, hup!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=835.7s	835.7	 Good!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=841.7s	841.7	 He's a big boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=842.7s	842.7	 Go, hup!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=843.7s	843.7	 If you were holding an object, you might be able to do this with your arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=848.7s	848.7	 Go, hup!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=850.2s	850.2	 If you were holding an object, like a cane or an umbrella or a pool noodle, I have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=855.9s	855.9	 video of jumping tricks with pool noodles and I'll link that in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=861.0s	861.0	 But if you're holding a hoop or a stick and you have a very big dog, it makes it easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=866.6s	866.6	 for them to go over your arm initially if you've got short arms like I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=872.7s	872.7	 Are you ready?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=881.5s	881.5	 So I'm going to be using the poles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcGoMVe6kk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=55&pp=iAQB&t=883.0s	883.0	 You can see I moved too fast too quickly.
