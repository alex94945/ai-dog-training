https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71T6K9IU9P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=206&pp=iAQB&t=1661.3s	1661.3	 When introducing the new dog to your household I don't suggest that you should just let them play together in the first few encounters and hope that nothing bad happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71T6K9IU9P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=206&pp=iAQB&t=1672.3s	1672.3	 The calmer the dogs are the less likely they'll be to overreact

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71T6K9IU9P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=206&pp=iAQB&t=1684.3s	1684.3	 rather than the first experience of playing being a negative experience for one of the dogs

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71T6K9IU9P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=206&pp=iAQB&t=1697.3s	1697.3	 But just because your dog tries to initiate play with the other dog doesn't necessarily mean that he won't suddenly feel overwhelmed when actually playing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71T6K9IU9P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=206&pp=iAQB&t=1705.3s	1705.3	 For example if the other dog were suddenly to do something that your dog was not expecting like putting his paws up on your dog's back or biting at your dog playfully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71T6K9IU9P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=206&pp=iAQB&t=1715.3s	1715.3	 If at any point a dog is getting stressed, overexcited or offering undesirable behavior you can interrupt the dog using a positively trained cue such as a recall, an attention noise or the cue leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71T6K9IU9P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=206&pp=iAQB&t=1746.2s	1746.2	 If your dog is just not listening you can separate your dogs and give them a break from each other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71T6K9IU9P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=206&pp=iAQB&t=1753.2s	1753.2	 It's important to learn what appropriate and inappropriate play looks like in dogs

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71T6K9IU9P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=206&pp=iAQB&t=1768.2s	1768.2	 Use management and prevention between encounters and interactions
