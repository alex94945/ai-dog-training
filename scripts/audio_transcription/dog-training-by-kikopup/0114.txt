https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 After attending university and acquiring a Bachelor of Science degree in biology, Ryan

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=48.8s	48.8	 After a decade of working at multiple zoos in numerous countries, Ryan then saw the opportunity

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=62.9s	62.9	 Through the Animal Training Academy, Ryan has connected hundreds of animal behavior

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=102.8s	102.8	 And as a result, I'm thrilled to share with you a number of our sessions working towards

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=182.4s	182.4	 target her top lip to my finger.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=237.1s	237.1	 from California in the USA.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=245.6s	245.6	 closed mouth, so seemingly a different approach might be beneficial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=257.1s	257.1	 an open mouth behavior and we might be able to capture it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=267.9s	267.9	 after a behavior your animal already does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=271.8s	271.8	 So for example, Phoebe opening her mouth is a behavior she does a lot throughout the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=277.9s	277.9	 day.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=284.5s	284.5	 then capture it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82WI1_3Dv4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=115&pp=iAQB&t=298.9s	298.9	 incorporated the top lip target into this.
