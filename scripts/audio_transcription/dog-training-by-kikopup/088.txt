https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, this is Kikopup's dog training tip of the day for today. I'm going to be talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=6.8s	6.8	 duration in behaviors. Now Cloud is pretty good at a very long down position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 but I've just taught him to stand and now before I go too many days or even weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=20.1s	20.1	 teaching him to stand and he only stands for a few seconds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 I want to teach him the concept that he has to stay in the position until either I ask for a different position or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=28.1s	28.1	 I release him with a release cue such as free or let's go or okay or whatever. Okay, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 The reason I don't like to choose okay as I say it all the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=41.2s	41.2	 So I laughed at myself. My release cue is free or get it. Free means come to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=46.8s	46.8	 Get it means get whatever treat there is on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 So I can say get it and then throw the treat like that and he knows he can get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 So if you're having a dog that's really struggling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=57.1s	57.1	 With the concept of staying if you've done a lot of leaving proof it for leave it leaving stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 Hi, he thinks we're doing the bow to the stand that we were doing previously in the tip of the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=70.1s	70.1	 So you can see why I need to work on the duration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 Okay, so I'm going to show you a quick little game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 I actually have a tutorial on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 But it's really building the concept that the behavior ends and then something happens at the end sometimes with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=85.3s	85.3	 Treat training people train the behavior in a training session, but then in real life, maybe they're in the kitchen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=91.7s	91.7	 They want to give their dog a treat so they say see it and then they give their dog a treat and then they walk away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 And then the dog is sitting there and then at some point the dog thinks oh, yeah, I don't have to sit anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=102.6s	102.6	 I'll get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 So it's really important for clarity that there is a very very precise ending that they're waiting for so the release cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=112.3s	112.3	 Okay, you've had a lot of treats now free so what I'm going to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 Your dog needs to know a leave it for this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 I am also going to utilize the end of the carpet. So I'm actually going to turn my back to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=126.8s	126.8	 So that he knows to stay on this carpet where we've worked on the exercise before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=133.3s	133.3	 Okay, so I'm just going to get him straight and usually I have my dog right in front of me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 But I'm going to try and do it at an angle so you can you can see him better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=142.1s	142.1	 But I'm going to ask him in the position that he's best at which is a down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 I'm going to say leave it and I'm going to put these treats down here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=153.5s	153.5	 But you can see he's getting up thinking that he can get them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 So this is a great proofing game because duration is staying in the in the down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 Not just getting up immediately thinking that this means get up. They're waiting for the release cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=168.1s	168.1	 There's stimulus control on the release cue meaning other cues don't mean get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=172.3s	172.3	 So I actually made a video on this about proofing for distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=176.8s	176.8	 So you're first going to click as the distraction happens and then go to pretend to put a treat down if your dog doesn't know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=183.6s	183.6	 Leave it which he I guess doesn't know in this situation. So I'm going to say leave it and then put the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=189.6s	189.6	 And then put the treat down on the ground good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=194.7s	194.7	 Leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 Good leave it awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=204.5s	204.5	 Leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=211.2s	211.2	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 Leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 Awesome leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=224.6s	224.6	 Leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 So when he's very confident with leaving it if you have a dog that's really good at leave it you might have to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 On the cue of get it which means they can actually have whatever it was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=238.1s	238.1	 So basically it's a very very simple game and a great way to learn the concept of your inner position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=244.6s	244.6	 You're waiting and then you get a cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=247.3s	247.3	 Where you can get up so by having something they really want and they're focused on this one thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=254.1s	254.1	 They're going to be more likely to understand in my opinion the concept of stay I can't get that thing until I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 Hear that cue now. You don't want to do this for hours and hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=264.9s	264.9	 It's just to initially train that concept of stay and get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 so I'd only do this for two to three seconds and then when the dog is understanding the concept of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=275.9s	275.9	 The duration you can add I mean of getting up only on the cue then you can add duration and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=283.7s	283.7	 There's not going to be like a treat tempting them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 They're just going to be laying and you can mark and reinforce because you can see it's way easier for him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=290.9s	290.9	 When there's not something that he really wants right in front of him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 But those games are really going to help with build the concept of the behavior ends at some specific point that I'm waiting for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=300.4s	300.4	 free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=302.1s	302.1	 Good boy. So if he doesn't get up when I say free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=305.3s	305.3	 I'm going to lure him or say get it and then throw the treat like that down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=310.3s	310.3	 Leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=314.3s	314.3	 Leave it good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=331.7s	331.7	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=333.9s	333.9	 You can see he's getting a little frustrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=336.4s	336.4	 Because he's like moving around looking at the treats wagging his tail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=340.4s	340.4	 So get it and I can use lower value treats next time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 I stupidly only have the same value for giving him some and also on the ground so if you can use a lower
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=352.9s	352.9	 Distraction as the I mean as the thing that they're released to like kibble and then he gets higher value treats like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=359.9s	359.9	 Piece of hot dog that can be very helpful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=362.9s	362.9	 Leave it good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=370.9s	370.9	 Get it good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=373.2s	373.2	 Okay, so now I actually thought I wouldn't have to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 That's where I should really end it and work on the down with the distraction, but instead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=383.2s	383.2	 I'm going to show you how to work on the stand with that distraction up good by doing this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=390.8s	390.8	 And I think it helps the concept having the dog on the edge of a platform or a carpet at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=398.1s	398.1	 But you want to quickly move on to where they're free somewhere else like right in the middle of the carpet as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=405.5s	405.5	 So that they don't only think staying is about being on the edge of a carpet leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=411.4s	411.4	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=413.6s	413.6	 Ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=415.7s	415.7	 Up nice good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=419.9s	419.9	 Good good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=426.3s	426.3	 Up nice good whoops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=432.9s	432.9	 That made him move his foot a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=437.7s	437.7	 Ready up good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06CbxTs_Rc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=89&pp=iAQB&t=458.6s	458.6	 Down down good
