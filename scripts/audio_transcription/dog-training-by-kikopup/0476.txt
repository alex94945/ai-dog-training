https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This is Kikopup's 4th of July special, How to Teach Hold a Flag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 The first step is getting your dog interested in a stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 Here you can see with Trish, I'm clicking her for simply touching the stick at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 In this next step, I'm teasing Trish with the stick and hoping that she'll mouth or bite the stick, which I will be able to click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 If you have a dog that's very unlikely to mouth an object that you drag around or tease the dog with, you can try using a hard dog bone that they like eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 And as the dog goes to bite the bone that you're holding, you can pull back on it and click for the dog holding on to the bone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 Now that we've practiced a little bit with other objects, I'm going to try with the flag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 I'm clicking for Trish taking the flag for only a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 You can practice getting the dog to take the flag in different positions, from standing up, sitting, laying down, or following you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 The next step is teaching the dog to drop the flag on cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 So give the dog the flag, say drop, hold the treat in front of your dog's nose, and as they drop the flag to get the treat, click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Kiko was having a hard time holding the flag because it was plastic, so we wrapped a piece of string around it to make it easier to hold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Once your dog is holding the flag for longer periods of time, you can ask the dog to do different behaviors while holding the flag to proof the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 Most dogs will drop the flag as you ask for the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 That's okay, simply click the behavior, for example a sit, and then give the dog the flag to take after they're sitting and hope that next time they might hold on to the flag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Here I'm showing how you can do a more complex trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 If your dog knows shake it, you can ask for the behavior first with the object they usually shake, and then get the dog to take the flag and then ask for the cue, shake it, and you'll have a dog that can wave the American flag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EiWIc8F99k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=477&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 See you next time, hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and happy 4th of July!
