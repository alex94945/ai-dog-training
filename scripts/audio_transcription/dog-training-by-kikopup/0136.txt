https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everybody, I'm extremely honored to welcome world-renowned trainer Laurie Stevens to give a brief introduction to canine fitness training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=9.1s	9.1	 Laurie is not only a professional dog trainer and animal behavior consultant,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=13.9s	13.9	 but she's also a canine fitness instructor, an animal massage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=19.4s	19.4	 practitioner, and a senior Tellington T-Touch training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 practitioner. You can find out more about her on her website
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=27.7s	27.7	 SeattleT-Touch.com. Laurie is also the creator of the Balance Harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=34.4s	34.4	 I don't know if you guys know about this harness, but it's actually a harness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 I use with one of my dogs, my Border Collie Halo, and I find it extremely useful because that it has a clip on the front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=44.8s	44.8	 and the back and when he wears his little service dog jacket,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=48.2s	48.2	 I love clipping it to the front and it's a very useful harness for me and my training and you guys know that I don't sponsor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=54.8s	54.8	 products so that's just a personal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 bit of information from me. So anyway,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=61.8s	61.8	 on to the video on canine fitness. Hello everyone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 I'm here to give you a short intro to canine fitness and hopefully pique your interest in learning more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=73.9s	73.9	 The first thing we want to think about when doing canine fitness is creating a safe learning environment for our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=82.2s	82.2	 This involves a lot of things, but the first is to make sure you're working on a non-slip flooring surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=90.2s	90.2	 So you can use a yoga mat or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=94.4s	94.4	 rubber flooring or some carpeting is not slippery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=98.4s	98.4	 If you're working outside, you just want to make sure the ground is semi-level and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=104.1s	104.1	 if you're working on grass, you want to make sure it's dry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=106.9s	106.9	 You also want to use appropriate equipment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=110.4s	110.4	 and you want to put that equipment away unless it's being used and I'll talk more about equipment later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=116.5s	116.5	 And you want to really make sure the environment is set up for success. So not too many distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=122.2s	122.2	 You want to have your treats ready, your marker ready if you're using a clicker or a verbal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 There's plenty of information on that in Kikopup channel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 So when teaching fitness behaviors, I like to start on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=138.1s	138.1	 The ground is a perfectly reasonable place to start. It's not sexy like some of the fitness equipment is, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=147.2s	147.2	 the safest place to start and there's a lot you can do on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=150.4s	150.4	 For example, if your dog or goat is standing, you can ask for a paw like a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=157.2s	157.2	 high five or a shake and for your dog to do that, they have to balance on the other three legs and that is hard work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 After you've worked on the ground for a bit, we can introduce stable equipment. For example, a platform or book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=174.2s	174.2	 So I'll talk about that in a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=177.8s	177.8	 If you're going to work on unstable equipment like an environment, you want to make sure the ground is stable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=184.2s	184.2	 If you're going to work on unstable equipment like an inflatable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 then you probably want to take a class in K9 Fitness that's given by a certified K9 Fitness trainer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=195.7s	195.7	 or work privately with a professional who's certified in K9 Fitness training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 You want to see that your learner is engaged, focused and in alignment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 And what I mean by in alignment is if your dog steps up on a platform, for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=214.6s	214.6	 you don't want the back legs to suddenly get really wide or the front legs to get wide or really narrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 You want the alignment to stay pretty consistent with where it is when your dog is normally standing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=228.1s	228.1	 And if your dog stands with their legs really wide, any dog really, you want to get your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=235.3s	235.3	 okayed for fitness by a veterinarian.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=238.6s	238.6	 And like I said, you want to have your treats and clicker ready and you want to keep your session short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=246.5s	246.5	 So I want to say a word about puppies and aging dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 So with puppies, as they're growing, their growth plates are open.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=254.8s	254.8	 And they're open until the puppy reaches 12 to 18 months of age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=261.2s	261.2	 So during this period when the growth plates are open, in order to keep from damaging their bones and joints,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=270.2s	270.2	 we just want to prevent them from jumping from height.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 For example, from beds, even pretty low beds, sofas, cars, that sort of thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=280.5s	280.5	 So best to keep your puppy on the ground or little jumps from the ground and not from high up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=287.8s	287.8	 There's plenty to do for puppies. They can experience balance. They can experience that on your bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=296.4s	296.4	 Just put them down off the bed onto the floor. They can walk across all sorts of different surfaces like hardwood floors, tiles, carpeting, cement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=309.5s	309.5	 Anything that you can put different things down. For example, bubble wrap or just lift the bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=317.4s	317.4	 Let them experience the environment. Let them experience life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=321.4s	321.4	 Because in all those experiences, they're learning and building confidence for what's ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=328.9s	328.9	 With aging dogs, we want to keep them moving. They might appear like as if they want to sleep all the time, but they don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=337.4s	337.4	 They want to engage with you and moving helps them engage with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=342.7s	342.7	 Fitness helps them stay strong throughout their entire lives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=347.8s	347.8	 What happens with aging dogs is they often lose hind end strength.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=352.7s	352.7	 Keeping their hind ends strong is super important for quality of life for aging dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=362.4s	362.4	 When we do fitness or movement type exercises, we want to make sure our dog chooses to engage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=369.0s	369.0	 We want to see that joy on their face. We want to progress slowly and incrementally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=374.6s	374.6	 Just like when you go to the gym, we don't start you off bench pressing 300 pounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=380.2s	380.2	 We start you off where you are, which is as a beginner and gradually building and probably never getting to 300 pounds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=389.2s	389.2	 We want to mark and reinforce movement or fitness behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=392.2s	392.2	 You want to happen as approximations along the way to the final behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=396.9s	396.9	 We always want to keep safety in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=400.6s	400.6	 I'm just going to mention a few of the benefits of fitness exercises or movement exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=406.6s	406.6	 Keep in mind you always want to check with your veterinarian first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=411.8s	411.8	 Fitness exercises strengthen muscle. They improve flexibility, alignment, and posture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=419.2s	419.2	 They can minimize the risk of injury. They can improve balance and stability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=424.8s	424.8	 They can improve confidence and behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=429.0s	429.0	 They build stamina. They increase body awareness, and they improve gait and movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=437.8s	437.8	 I'm just going to tell you about one simple exercise, and that's platform work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=442.7s	442.7	 Well, it can get complicated, but what I'm going to tell you about is the simple part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=447.5s	447.5	 You always want to start with stable platforms. So a book or two books or a short platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=455.0s	455.0	 Maybe one that's made for canine fitness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=458.2s	458.2	 You want to introduce your dog to all equipment slowly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=461.9s	461.9	 making sure that you mark and reinforce any action interactions with that equipment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=467.5s	467.5	 And you want to watch your dog for proper alignment, like I said earlier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=471.0s	471.0	 and after your session, put equipment away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=475.0s	475.0	 I like to teach dogs first thing, how to do a touch or target my fingers or my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=482.6s	482.6	 That way I can use that. For example, if this is a platform, I can use my hand or two fingers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 as a target and invite the dog or goat up onto the platform. Yes, goats do platform work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=506.0s	506.0	 So there's a video in Keiko Puff for how to teach this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=510.6s	510.6	 So this is just a really nice way to invite your dog to do canine fitness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=517.0s	517.0	 Okay, so if you have a small dog, for example, a Chihuahua, you might start with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=524.9s	524.9	 a book that's half an inch or an inch tall. If you have a much larger dog, maybe even a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=535.5s	535.5	 Great Dane, then you can start at three inches, maybe four. You want to make sure that you buy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=544.8s	544.8	 some anti-slip material. This is super cheap. It's rubber shelving material, anti-slip material,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=552.5s	552.5	 and you can cut it up and wrap whatever piece of equipment you're going to use or place it on top
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=560.6s	560.6	 so the dog's paws don't slip on the book, especially on book covers or on the platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=569.8s	569.8	 So there's two behaviors I teach first, and that is targeting the platform with two front paws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=580.3s	580.3	 and standing on the platform or two books and building some duration with all four feet up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=588.4s	588.4	 So standing, which is really a hard behavior. So I'm going to use my phone since it has a non-slip

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=605.0s	605.0	 you'll just have to pretend that I've got my fingers there to invite the goat up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=609.2s	609.2	 And so here's the ground, and I'm just going to invite the goat to put two front feet up

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=643.8s	643.8	 back. Okay, for standing on a platform, you wouldn't be able to use this short one because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=651.4s	651.4	 then the hind legs would have to come in really close and the back would really flex like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkOsyGJBrU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=137&pp=iAQB&t=659.0s	659.0	 or roach. So you want to use a long enough platform or you want to use two books to invite your dog up.
