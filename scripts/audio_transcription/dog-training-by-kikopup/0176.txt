https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XUaef63Fd4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=177&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 the things I do want her to do. So I've already been using that attention noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XUaef63Fd4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=177&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 if she goes to try and bother my other dogs or she goes to try and chew on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XUaef63Fd4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=177&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 something and then I can interrupt her and get her attention back on me so I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XUaef63Fd4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=177&pp=iAQB&t=41.3s	41.3	 perhaps going and chewing on one of her bones in her bed. In these next two
