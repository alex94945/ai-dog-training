https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone yesterday I posted a video example of a training session with my little nine week old puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=6.4s	6.4	 He just turned nine weeks yesterday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=8.4s	8.4	 And I thought it would be interesting to see the continuation of the training session yesterday today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 I actually haven't done any training with him like in a training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 since yesterday all I've been doing is reinforcing him for being calm around the house like this and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=28.3s	28.3	 Reinforcing appropriate behavior around my other dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=31.5s	31.5	 So I have practiced that game taking turns taking treats, which I also posted recently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=38.2s	38.2	 With him where I was practicing giving him a treat and my other dogs a treat so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=44.9s	44.9	 With most puppies you don't really need to immediately work on a stay with distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=51.4s	51.4	 But because I like training my other dogs with treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=55.3s	55.3	 And he's got a watch the other dogs getting trained and sometimes it's pretty exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 I'm gonna start working on teaching him to relax on his bed while there are distractions happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 So that's what I'm adding to yesterday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=69.9s	69.9	 I worked on teaching him to go to his bed for treats and lay down so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 Basically, I'm just gonna start to add some distractions to that so now that he's on his bed laying down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=83.7s	83.7	 And actually I might do it again teach him to go to the bed and lay down so you can see the process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=90.9s	90.9	 Good job, great. There you go. So before I was putting a treat down and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 Marking him for going to eat it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 then luring him with the treat in my hand and then with no treat in my hand and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=108.6s	108.6	 He he's looking for where the treats coming from right and then the next step was seeing if he might offer going to the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=116.2s	116.2	 And he just about offered it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 Yesterday, but you can see I'm helping him out with a few visual cues in my hand because I want to work on a different step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 So if I was gonna work on just the concept of offering going to the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=130.6s	130.6	 I would spend a little bit more time on that but right now I'm gonna work on some distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=135.7s	135.7	 So it's gonna be me and I'm holding the food that he wants so I'm gonna move around and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=141.8s	141.8	 Mark him for staying on the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 So I'm just gonna practice stepping away from the bed and then coming back and putting the treat down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=151.6s	151.6	 Slowly between his paws so the slower that I move my hand and bring it to him the more likely he's gonna stay down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 Good job and we worked on the settle and that's why he's doing really well with just staying down like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 And he might think to get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=169.9s	169.9	 If he weren't if he were to get up I could just lure him back into the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 See he got up right there. I could just lure him back to the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 Wait till he lays down again, and then just make it a little bit easier for him. Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 So I'm just practicing walking around the bed so when I go behind him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 I'm gonna drop a couple treats because most dogs will want to turn around to see where you went
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=194.4s	194.4	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=204.9s	204.9	 Good job now. I'm gonna release him free because I'm gonna change the camera angle again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 Since he did so well with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=212.4s	212.4	 I actually am gonna work on the concept of teaching him to offer going to his bed to lay down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 So now he's just offering sitting so I might put a treat down there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 So that he's up and about and then stand closer to the bed so that he might think to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 Onto the bed and then I'm just going to feed him on the bed down on the ground and hopefully that will help him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Think to lay down like that. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=237.7s	237.7	 Now I'm gonna release him free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=240.5s	240.5	 Now when I teach offering going onto the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 I also like to give multiple treats and not just have the dog get straight up again to offer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 Because what can happen is that you get a dog that goes to the bed and then jumps right off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=252.6s	252.6	 So they can go to the bed again to get their treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 So I'm not clicking the moment he goes to the bed anymore because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=264.5s	264.5	 What I want to do is eventually not click every time that he hits the bed because they can start to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=270.5s	270.5	 It can start to become a fixed picture where you can't increase criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=276.5s	276.5	 So if I keep clicking him going to the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=280.0s	280.0	 It's going to be really hard not to click when he goes to the bed because he'll be like, hey, where's my click?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=284.8s	284.8	 I always get the click when I hit the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=286.8s	286.8	 So I'm saying good job and just dropping a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=290.7s	290.7	 So I'm reinforcing the behavior but I'm getting rid of the clicker very quickly and changing the picture a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=296.7s	296.7	 So that it's not really really fixed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=299.7s	299.7	 So you can change the picture and that makes it easier to add
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=303.6s	303.6	 Criteria so I might send him to the bed from different areas free send him to the bed for different durations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=313.1s	313.1	 So here I'm going to just wait till he lays down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=315.7s	315.7	 Good before clicking good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=317.7s	317.7	 And that's really going to help because as you'll see he's going to go to the bed probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=323.7s	323.7	 Oh he's not when he does go to the bed and lay down he's not going to get confused if I don't click right away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=331.7s	331.7	 So I could continue talking to you for a little bit and then I can go to the bed and I can click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=337.7s	337.7	 And then I can go to the bed and I can click again and I can go to the bed and I can click again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=343.7s	343.7	 So I could continue talking to you for a little bit and then give him a treat like that awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=349.7s	349.7	 And he's not just going to think oh no I didn't get my click I did something wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=353.7s	353.7	 So that's why I like to do that that was a little bit of a long explanation sorry about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=359.7s	359.7	 So now we're going to do something fun are you ready free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=363.7s	363.7	 So we're going to do a little bit of leg weaving to practice our luring skills now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=367.7s	367.7	 And I worked a little bit long on the bed I wasn't planning to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=371.7s	371.7	 I just thought it would be fun to show him offering for the first time good good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=377.7s	377.7	 And I'm using a verbal marker good which I like to use with my puppies because I have treats in both my hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=384.7s	384.7	 And good I don't want to click near his ear now did you see how he opened his mouth while he was following the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=390.7s	390.7	 I had been trying to avoid that if you go back and watch the video about how I started the first luring session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=396.7s	396.7	 So he's a little hungry and a little excited now and I lured him too quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=401.7s	401.7	 So what I'm going to do is hold the treat higher higher up good and then not move it as fast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=411.7s	411.7	 Good and put it down on the ground before he's gone more distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=416.7s	416.7	 Another thing you can do if your dog is super excited and trying to bite your hand or opens their mouth to lick for the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=424.7s	424.7	 Is do this hunts and gradual trail first so they're getting used to following where the treat is coming from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=431.7s	431.7	 Without jumping licking and biting for it so another way of training luring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=438.7s	438.7	 You can see he's really calm eating those treats so now I'm going to try from higher up again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=444.7s	444.7	 And I'm just going to give that to him because I wasn't fast enough getting my hand into the right place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=451.7s	451.7	 Ready here we go good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=458.7s	458.7	 Good putting the treat down on the ground also gives you time to do the next step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=464.7s	464.7	 So he's still a little bit excited by the luring you can see he kind of darts forward and I'll keep working on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=472.7s	472.7	 But this is his maybe his fifth session with luring so he's doing really good in my opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=480.7s	480.7	 But that's something that you want to keep your eyes out for is that the dog isn't looking frustrated because all that frustration can get trapped in the concept of doing training sessions with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=493.7s	493.7	 Good okay that was very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=496.7s	496.7	 I'm going to lure him around me by just dropping treats and then I'm going to try to lure him from my left hand to my right hand good like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=508.7s	508.7	 And if you have a bad back you can do this sitting down or around a cone which I showed previously me doing in my luring video with him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=520.7s	520.7	 Good job you can also use a target stick with little short dogs or puppies if you're in a chair or you can't bend over and that is really awesome but I'm not going to work on that right now

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=544.7s	544.7	 So before this training session he was kind of sleepy and not very over excited he wasn't playing with toys he was just relaxing around the house and that's why I chose to do the stay type behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=558.7s	558.7	 And now that he's a little bit more frisky I'm going to work on a recall to the dremel so he's never heard the dremel before but he's not scared of noises out and about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=571.7s	571.7	 So I'm going to be maybe this distance from him when he hears the noise for the first time and I'm going to have it on for a very short amount of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=584.7s	584.7	 Hi Pepe! Okay so if you have a puppy that you think is worried about noises check out the video that I linked in the description on how to condition the dremel and the grooming tools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=599.7s	599.7	 Good job! So I have it on low and I'm just turning it on. Good boy! And moving away from him as I make happy noises. Yay! Good job! So he's getting used to that noise. Woohoo! Good boy! Oh you missed your treat over there. You missed your treat. Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=620.7s	620.7	 Awesome! There's one right here too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=624.7s	624.7	 Are you ready? Yay! Good boy! Good boy! Pupsy poo! Good job! Good boy! And now I'm just leaving it on and running away from him. Woohoo! Good job! There we go! That was awesome! That was awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=652.7s	652.7	 If I wasn't filming this training session I most likely would have just worked on the settle on the mat with distractions as a lesson in itself perhaps some handling as well but I would have broken it up into small little sessions where I just work on the dremel when he was a little bit interested in food. Keep that short and fun. The same with like training a recall but I thought I would add it all into this video just for convenience for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=682.7s	682.7	 And also because he's working for treats and he got a little bit excited by them so I'm just going to toss this one away because he's super close to me it's hard to see him there. So I'm just going to get him to sit and I'm reaching under his chin while I give him a treat like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=697.7s	697.7	 Because if I try to reach under his chin he thinks I'm giving him a treat so I'm just going to do that like that. Good job! And this is the beginning of teaching a chin rest so I'll also link that video in the description below. Good boy! Awesome! So I'm reaching over his head and feeding and at the moment I'm not doing very much petting without feeding at the same time because he is pretty mouthy so in this training session I'm just going to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=727.7s	727.7	 So I'm just getting him used to all the stuff that I do where he doesn't immediately go and check out what my hand is doing. So I'm going to touch his feet and feed the treat at the same time. So I'm basically reinforcing him for the absence of doing anything when I touch him. Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=743.7s	743.7	 So you want to make sure that your puppy is of course not backing away or looking worried about what you're doing. Good job! So one way you can test that is to throw the treat away and see if they want to come back to do more. He he! Yeah you do. Whoops! I dropped it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=761.7s	761.7	 Where'd it go? Okay well that's the end of that session. You did very well. Yes you did. Now after a training session like this is the perfect time to go out, have your puppy go out to the bathroom and also get some water especially if they had something dry like kibble. Are you ready to go out? Let's go out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=786.7s	786.7	 Actually I could bring you with me. Whoop!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=791.7s	791.7	 Go pee! So I'm going to say go pee if he's just about to pee. Good job! And then you can either use verbal praise. Good boy! Or give a treat afterwards. Yeah you did good. Want that? Let's go back in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6V6REcD3k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=143&pp=iAQB&t=814.7s	814.7	 Thank you so much for watching.
