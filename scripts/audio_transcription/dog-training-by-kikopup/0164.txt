https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody in this tutorial I'm going to show you how you can teach your dog to wave both of his paws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 like little epic is doing here. So some dogs find it easier than others and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=11.7s	11.7	 if your dog already knows to sit pretty it's going to be easier because they've already built the muscles to sit up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 so that they can then wave their paws. So there are many ways that you could do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 You could either do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 targeting of both paws where the dog puts both paws on your arm like that or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=30.8s	30.8	 you could do one paw and then the other and I have a video on how to train your dog to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=37.2s	37.2	 offer one paw and then the other and that's the way that I'm going to show you how to do it in this tutorial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=42.7s	42.7	 Now with Epic here when I first got her at eight weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 she was already offering this behavior when she wanted something like to go out the door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 or to get a treat and I actually didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=55.5s	55.5	 reinforce it instead I built it from scratch so she wouldn't just offer it all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 So that's one of the downfalls of if you mark a behavior that the dog does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 without putting a cue on it fast enough sometimes they can offer it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 thinking that that's what you want them to do if they want to ask for a treat. So I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 want her to sit calmly and then offer the behavior when I do this with my two fingers and I'm gonna call it celebrate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 Ready? Celebrate! Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 So I'm gonna show you how I'm training Halo to do it. So we've had a couple of training sessions and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 you will see him progress hopefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 So I like to have the dog on a mat like this to do the exercise to keep them in place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=100.7s	100.7	 but there's no need you could have just the dog on a non-slip surface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 but this surface is actually less slippery than this carpet so it's a nice surface for balancing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 I first warmed up by getting Halo to offer his left paw and his right paw on cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=116.7s	116.7	 Wave. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=118.5s	118.5	 Bye. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 Wave. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 Wave. Good. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 Good. I worked on teaching him to wave without touching my hand because the trick where he uses both paws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=137.1s	137.1	 he's not gonna touch my hand. So waving with the left paw and waving with the right paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=142.2s	142.2	 So this is wave. Good. And bye. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 And if he creeps forwards a little like that I can just lure him back onto the object and get him to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=153.3s	153.3	 That's why I have this object because when he uses his feet specifically he comes closer and closer in a very excited way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=160.3s	160.3	 I then also worked on getting him to sit pretty so you can teach that first and I have a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=166.7s	166.7	 tutorial on how to teach sit pretty in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=170.4s	170.4	 Halo sit pretty. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=173.1s	173.1	 The next thing I did was ask him to do sit pretty and then I said wave and bye and gave him the hand signals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 for both of his feet and then any sort of paw movement I would mark and reinforce. Sit pretty. Wave and bye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 Good. Now if you don't want your sit pretty to turn into something where they always wave and bye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=193.9s	193.9	 you can also just ask for a sit pretty and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=197.3s	197.3	 then mark and reinforce and sometimes I'll go back to using luring when training a new behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=203.1s	203.1	 so that the dog isn't going to be offering things in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=207.1s	207.1	 So I could say sit pretty and lure him into the behavior. Good. And now I'm gonna ask for the different paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 Are you ready? Sit pretty. Wave and bye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=219.2s	219.2	 Good job. Sit pretty. Wave and bye. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=224.9s	224.9	 Wave and bye. Good. Now if he gets up and waves and waves the paws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=230.2s	230.2	 I'm gonna mark but then I'm gonna ask him to sit again and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=233.7s	233.7	 mark and reinforce him for sitting pretty so that he's getting used to the concept that it's about sitting pretty and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 moving his feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=242.5s	242.5	 Sit pretty. Wave and bye. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=244.5s	244.5	 And I can hold my hands down lower too if that is encouraging him to get up if I have my hands up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 Ready? Wave and bye. Good. Sit pretty. Wave and bye. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=258.8s	258.8	 Sit pretty. Wave and bye. If you wanted to add a new cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=263.2s	263.2	 so that you don't have to say the two cues back-to-back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=266.4s	266.4	 you say that just before you say the old cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 So I'm gonna say celebrate and then I'm gonna do the hand signals and see if he gets it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 If not, I'm gonna use my old verbal cue. Sit pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=278.7s	278.7	 Celebrate. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=283.7s	283.7	 Sit pretty. Celebrate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=287.9s	287.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=289.3s	289.3	 The other way that you can teach this is teaching your dog to sit pretty and do a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=294.6s	294.6	 high ten with both of his paws and then what you're gonna do is ask for a high ten
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=299.7s	299.7	 but hold your paws your hands just out of reach so your dog can't reach them and that can initiate the waving behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=307.3s	307.3	 So you're gonna mark the millisecond the dog is reaching out for your hands and not touching them. Sit pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=313.3s	313.3	 Celebrate. Good. Can you cover your nose?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=317.1s	317.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VObmP_ZZ8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=165&pp=iAQB&t=318.7s	318.7	 Cover your nose. Good. Sit pretty. Be cool.
