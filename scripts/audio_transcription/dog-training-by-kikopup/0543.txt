https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, I want to talk today about how you can communicate with your dog using their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 own language with something called calming signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=8.6s	8.6	 So firstly, calming signals, what are they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=11.1s	11.1	 They're a way that dogs communicate with other dogs to calm down other dogs and tell them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=16.5s	16.5	 I'm okay, you're okay, or they're a way that dogs can calm themselves down internally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 Turid Rugas, an internationally renowned dog trainer, has been studying calming signals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=28.3s	28.3	 and researching them for over a decade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=31.2s	31.2	 She is responsible for all this information about calming signals being around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=36.1s	36.1	 She has a book and a DVD about calming signals and I'll put a link to those in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=41.8s	41.8	 So check those out, they're really cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 So dogs offer each other a multitude of signals constantly and if you start to recognize them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 you can actually get an idea of what your dog is thinking and feeling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=55.8s	55.8	 Watch what happens when I pick up Kiko, she's going to yawn and offer me a calming signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 Dogs think they're being obvious all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=70.8s	70.8	 They don't realize we don't understand what they're saying and that is how a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=74.7s	74.7	 get bitten in the face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 In this video I'm only going to give you calming signals that involve the face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=80.9s	80.9	 In another video we'll go over calming signals that dogs offer when they're moving or playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 So here are some of the calming signals you can actually offer your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 Okay, the first one is soft slow eye blinks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=99.7s	99.7	 The second one is looking away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=105.7s	105.7	 The third one is lip licking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=111.7s	111.7	 The fourth one is yawning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=112.7s	112.7	 I like to make a noise when I yawn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 Or sighing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=125.7s	125.7	 Yawn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=128.7s	128.7	 Those are the main four that are really important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=130.7s	130.7	 There are many others that dogs offer each other that you can try and imitate like sniffing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=135.7s	135.7	 the ground, you can pretend like you're interested in the ground, or lifting a paw, you can try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=141.6s	141.6	 showing your dog, lifting a paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=143.6s	143.6	 But I don't try to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=145.6s	145.6	 Other people have tried shaking off for their dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 Another thing you can do is offer a combination of calming signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=151.6s	151.6	 So for instance, here's a combination of calming signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 I might offer a dog that's scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 I go over to the client's house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 Here I come in the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 This dog is looking at me going, are you a threat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 And I say to the dog, no, I'm cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 And I do that by offering calming signals to the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 So I walk in, I yawn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 I don't look directly at the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=173.6s	173.6	 I'm saying I'm not a threat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=178.6s	178.6	 Lip licks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=181.6s	181.6	 Yawning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=184.6s	184.6	 Telling the dog calm down, it's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 Everything's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=188.6s	188.6	 I am not a threat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=189.6s	189.6	 Calming signals are great in a dog training class, before an agility trial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=195.6s	195.6	 Whenever your dog's stressed at the vet, you can offer your dog calming signals and tell them everything's cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 Calming signals are also great if you're walking down the street and your dog sees something that's slightly scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 You can yawn, tell them I'm not even freaked out about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 It's cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 I use calming signals constantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=214.6s	214.6	 The other night, there were coyotes howling really close to my house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 Both my dog's heads lifted up and they went like, whoa, what is that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=225.5s	225.5	 I yawned, I licked my lips, I made a huge sigh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=229.5s	229.5	 They looked at me and they thought, oh cool, well she's not bothered about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=234.5s	234.5	 It's not a big deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 It's a way of telling your dogs, be cool, everything's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=239.5s	239.5	 I'm in charge of these problems right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=243.5s	243.5	 Another way you can use calming signals is when you're greeting a strange dog and they don't know you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=250.5s	250.5	 It's a great way of saying, I'm cool, don't worry about me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 Here's some footage of dogs in my friend's dog training class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=257.5s	257.5	 If you're not consciously looking for calming signals, you probably haven't ever noticed them before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=262.5s	262.5	 But dogs offer them very often in a dog training class because it's stressful to be around a group of dogs you don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 Some of the calming signals happen so quickly you might not even see them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=272.5s	272.5	 This one is pretty obvious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=273.5s	273.5	 The little chihuahua is scratching her head and giving lip licks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=277.5s	277.5	 The dog in the back is yawning because he can't get to where he wants to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=281.4s	281.4	 This poodle is licking her lips to calm down the person who's petting her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=285.4s	285.4	 Carmen the chihuahua also offers a lip lick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=290.4s	290.4	 This shy cavalier puppy does a look away to tell the other dog to go away and it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=295.4s	295.4	 Now the same dog is being bothered by an adult poodle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=298.4s	298.4	 His ears are back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=299.4s	299.4	 He looks away numerous times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=301.4s	301.4	 He does a lip lick, he does a paw lift, and now he arcs around the poodle to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=307.4s	307.4	 Please don't bother me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=309.4s	309.4	 This little puppy is offering lip licks, soft slow eye blinks, and look aways and a yawn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=315.4s	315.4	 Here I'm petting Kiko in her bed and she's telling me in no uncertain terms that it's highly annoying and it's a great way to ruin the relationship we have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 Splash also tells me that it's a little stressful to constantly have your head messed with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=330.4s	330.4	 Ahhhh! Yawn!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=333.4s	333.4	 Yawn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=335.4s	335.4	 Yawn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=339.4s	339.4	 Ahhhh!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=341.4s	341.4	 Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19SZTwQkpEw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=544&pp=iAQB&t=342.4s	342.4	 Can you yawn?
