https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, in this video I want to do some myth busting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=3.3s	3.3	 There's a lot of information out there on dog training, in other YouTube videos, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=7.7s	7.7	 also in blog posts and articles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 But just because it's there doesn't mean it's necessarily correct information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=14.3s	14.3	 I just wanted to go over something that a lot of people have been asking me recently,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=18.9s	18.9	 and also I made a video about how you can pick your dog up if they're fearful, and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 lot of people have been responding that, oh, you shouldn't pick your dog up when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 fearful because you don't want to reinforce your dog for being fearful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=31.6s	31.6	 And that's a big misconception that people have, that you can actually reinforce fear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 I'm going to give you two reasons why you cannot reinforce fear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=41.2s	41.2	 The number one reason is very simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 Fear is an emotion, not a behavior, and you technically cannot reinforce an emotion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 And the second reason is that fear is so aversive that no amount of petting or food is going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=56.6s	56.6	 to combat that huge aversive quality that the animal's experiencing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=62.8s	62.8	 To make this more clear, I'm going to give you an example by Patricia McConnell in her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=67.3s	67.3	 article that's called, You Cannot Reinforce Fear, Dogs in Thunderstorms, and I'll put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 a link to that article below in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 Her example in the article is about a person who has their house robbed, and the woman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 is very, very fearful when she comes and finds out that her house is robbed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=83.7s	83.7	 When a friend comes over and hugs her and gives her tea, basically that person hugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 her and giving her tea isn't going to make that woman more likely to be fearful when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 a robber robs her house again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 In fact, it might actually do the opposite and make her less fearful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=101.6s	101.6	 My own example is my Chihuahua Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 When I moved to Sweden, there were people setting off fireworks every day during December,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 and at first when I took Kiko outside, she was so traumatized by the fireworks that she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 was shaking and she was fearful for three days after the fireworks had gone off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 So every time we heard a firework, I would present her with food, but she was unable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=122.2s	122.2	 to eat it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=123.2s	123.2	 Gradually, after many days, because these fireworks went off for a whole month, I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=128.4s	128.4	 present her food and pick her up and coddle her and tell her it was okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=133.3s	133.3	 After a month, Kiko went from being traumatized by a firework for three days to being traumatized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 for one day to being traumatized for only an hour after the firework.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 And then finally, we worked all the way down to after a month, a firework would go off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 and within three seconds, Kiko could eat a treat, shake it off, and recover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 And what I was doing with Kiko was after the firework happened, I'd pick her up and just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 restrain her, walk home, or offer her food, see if she'd take food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=161.9s	161.9	 If not, we would just go home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 A lot of people would say, ooh, don't pick your dog up because you'll reinforce fear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 Let him work through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 A lot of my techniques involve handling a dog to calm them down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=174.1s	174.1	 So if a dog is stressed, fearful, or reactive, I'm going to use massage to calm the dog down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 And a lot of clients are like, ooh, but I've heard that if you pet a dog or give them treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=186.3s	186.3	 that will reinforce them being reactive or fearful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=189.9s	189.9	 And in actual fact, it's the opposite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=192.6s	192.6	 Handling a dog can release oxytocin, which can calm a dog down and make a dog more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=197.8s	197.8	 social and increase their ability to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 So I would definitely say handle your dog and talk to your dog when your dog is fearful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=206.9s	206.9	 Try to help them cope with that fearful situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=209.9s	209.9	 Or if you can't help them cope, get out of there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 There's no point in having your dog have even a more fearful response to this stimuli that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=217.6s	217.6	 they'll remember in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=218.6s	218.6	 You're going to either interrupt it by getting out of there or try to help your dog cope
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 using your voice, your touch, or reinforcement like food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=227.9s	227.9	 What you don't want to do is panic yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=230.7s	230.7	 So if your dog is scared of a firework or something, don't go, it's OK, it's OK, it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 OK, don't worry, don't worry, and act frantic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=239.5s	239.5	 That is not very helpful to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=241.7s	241.7	 So that's all for today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=242.7s	242.7	 I'm going to have more videos containing tips and tutorials on working with shy, reactive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 and fearful dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvPzqealYM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=391&pp=iAQB&t=249.3s	249.3	 See you later, guys.
