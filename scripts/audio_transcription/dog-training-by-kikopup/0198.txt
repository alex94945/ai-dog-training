https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody! This video is on the topic of solving unwanted behavior without the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 use of physical or psychological intimidation. So when using positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=10.5s	10.5	 reinforcement to solve behavior problems, the focus is on training a new behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=16.9s	16.9	 to take place of the unwanted behavior and you're going to train it to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=21.7s	21.7	 point where it's stronger than the old behavior and while you're training this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 new behavior, you can use management and prevention from preventing the old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=32.5s	32.5	 behavior from happening and if the old behavior were to happen, you can use a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 technique called interruption where you're interrupting that behavior and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 not letting it become rehearsed and practiced again and there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=47.5s	47.5	 different ways to do that using positive reinforcement but very basically you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=52.6s	52.6	 train a cue like the recall come or something like that and then you can use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=59.4s	59.4	 that to interrupt the behavior. Now you'll need to train and proof this cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 so that you'll be able to use it when you need to interrupt unwanted behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 and I have a video on how to train those cues and also the different cues you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=76.2s	76.2	 use and I have a list of ten. I like to think of behaviors in two categories. One
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 is behaviors that are unwanted that the dogs do but they're calm and relaxed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=87.8s	87.8	 while doing them. So for example sitting on your couch. Your dog has a habit of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=92.7s	92.7	 sitting on your couch and all you need to do is train the dog to do an alternate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 behavior which is laying in their dog bed. So that's pretty simple. You just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=102.8s	102.8	 build that behavior to be stronger than the behavior of sitting on the couch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=107.6s	107.6	 Then the other category of behaviors is that the dog has a high level of arousal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=112.9s	112.9	 doing the behavior or they have a certain emotion that's connected to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=118.1s	118.1	 behavior. So for example that the dog is chasing a squirrel they're very excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=124.1s	124.1	 so when you have a behavior that's unwanted and the dog is also very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=128.5s	128.5	 aroused and very stressed you can't just use treats bring out treats or even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 punishment trainers they wouldn't be able to just use punishment in those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=139.7s	139.7	 situations because the animal is too excited to be able to learn correctly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 and the reinforcers or punishers aren't going to be effective because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=151.3s	151.3	 haven't been conditioned to be able to be used in those circumstances. So in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=156.2s	156.2	 those type of situations what's really necessary is to not put the dog into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=162.5s	162.5	 that exact situation again until the training is complete but instead to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=167.9s	167.9	 break the training up into small successful approximations. For example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=173.2s	173.2	 with the dog that chases cars you wouldn't initiate the training with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=177.3s	177.3	 dog on the sidewalk next to the road you could instead go somewhere like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 middle of a park or the edge of a parking lot where the cars are at a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=189.7s	189.7	 that had an extremely fearful or aggressive reaction to having his nails
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=194.1s	194.1	 trimmed you can't just pick his foot up trim a nail and then feed a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 because for some dogs that's too much and they won't find the food that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 give positively reinforcing and it's not going to change their emotional

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=213.5s	213.5	 happened before they got the treat was so traumatic to the dog that getting a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=199&pp=iAQB&t=227.2s	227.2	 steps up smaller and one thing you could do specifically with that exercise is
