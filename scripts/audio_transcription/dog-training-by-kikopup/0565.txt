https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Now the dogs are walking, yeah the dogs are walking, yeah the dogs are walking, yeah the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 dogs are walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 Before you get started, you might want to muffle your clicker with a piece of poster
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 tack over the dimple of the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=26.4s	26.4	 This makes it not as loud and is great for working in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 Charging the clicker or building meaning to the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=32.7s	32.7	 Click, pause, feed your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=35.2s	35.2	 Do this ten times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=36.7s	36.7	 If your dog doesn't alert to the clicker after ten to twenty repetitions, it could mean that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=41.9s	41.9	 what you have as a treat is not high value enough to work for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=46.4s	46.4	 You want to click and then move to give him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 Otherwise he will learn that this is the sign that a treat is coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 You can now use food to get behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=55.4s	55.4	 I could lure his face upwards and as his butt goes down, I can click and give him the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 So I'm telling him I like it when you do that with your butt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 Stopping mouthing and biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=70.9s	70.9	 And then he's going to want to eat the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=73.7s	73.7	 Okay so how about we talk about mouthing because he actually wants to mouth something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 All the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 So how do we stop him from doing that undesirable behavior without punishment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 Instead I'm going to tell him what he should do which is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 Puppers!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 When he's not mouthing the leash he gets a click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=99.2s	99.2	 And now I can wave the leash around and click him for not eating the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=112.2s	112.2	 The same would be for your hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 Like most puppies would bite you if you did this with your hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 So instead you can do all the same stuff that would usually make him bite you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=125.2s	125.2	 And give him a click instead for the absence of the bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 You can also use your voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 So having a marker word like, yes, to mean you did that perfectly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 So yes could mean you didn't turn around and nip my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=142.2s	142.2	 And some dogs, some little puppies, you might only get to do yes, barely touch them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=149.2s	149.2	 Because they want to mouth you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=151.2s	151.2	 This one not so much yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 And if you ever want to play rough and tumble games with him, have a toy in each hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=156.2s	156.2	 So he can play along because this kind of game is not a fun game for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=162.2s	162.2	 Because they want to interact and bite your hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=165.2s	165.2	 Yes, that's what he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=167.2s	167.2	 So toy in each hand and he gets to enjoy it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 So hand on the chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=174.2s	174.2	 He's waiting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 I can see already that after the click he's waiting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=179.2s	179.2	 Hand on top of the head equals a click and a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=182.2s	182.2	 You can practice all different grooming things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=185.2s	185.2	 Now looking inside his ears equals a click and a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=189.2s	189.2	 Checking his teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 Are his teeth still in there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=194.2s	194.2	 Click and treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=215.2s	215.2	 Positive Interrupter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=216.2s	216.2	 How to get your dog to stop doing an unwanted behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=221.2s	221.2	 Okay, in this short little tutorial I'm going to show you how to condition a positive interrupter noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 What is that you may ask?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 It's a noise you can use instead of saying no or eh eh or wrong or stop that or max.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=234.2s	234.2	 So there are a few reasons why you shouldn't say no or eh eh to interrupt dog's behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=238.2s	238.2	 One, it suppresses your dog's behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=241.2s	241.2	 It doesn't teach them what you do want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=243.2s	243.2	 Two, you associate yourself with punishment and your dog will be less likely to interact with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=248.2s	248.2	 And three, if your dog learns when you're not around nothing bad happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=253.2s	253.2	 They start to only offer the undesirable things while you're gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=257.2s	257.2	 So barking, chewing, urinating in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=261.2s	261.2	 They will start to do all those fun behaviors while you're not around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=264.2s	264.2	 And then that makes them very difficult to train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=267.2s	267.2	 It's better to use a sound rather than the dog's name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=270.2s	270.2	 Something that always sounds the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 Something that can be conditioned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=274.2s	274.2	 Like a green light you step on the gas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=276.2s	276.2	 It's muscle memory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=277.2s	277.2	 You step on the gas, you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=279.2s	279.2	 The dog hears the noise which means look at me or which means look at me, stop doing what you're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=285.2s	285.2	 They do it without even thinking because it's become muscle memory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=288.2s	288.2	 Where if you use their name like Kiko, Kiko, hi Kiko, oh you're such a good girl Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=295.2s	295.2	 Then the dog never knows should I stop what I'm doing and look at you or are you just saying my name over and over again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=302.2s	302.2	 People overuse their dog's names.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=304.2s	304.2	 You can make the same noise into a noise that's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=309.2s	309.2	 Your dog will always turn to you, give you 100% attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 So to do that you just make the noise and feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=318.2s	318.2	 And it has to be something really delicious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=320.2s	320.2	 Like right now he's not as excited as he was as when we started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=324.2s	324.2	 So two to three minute lessons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=327.2s	327.2	 Make the noise, feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=330.2s	330.2	 And you're associating that noise with a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=338.2s	338.2	 Here you can see I'm doing the same conditioning exercise with Spooky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=341.2s	341.2	 I'm pairing the noise with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=350.2s	350.2	 Next step is make the noise and get some eye contact from him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=354.2s	354.2	 So I'm going to make the noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=357.2s	357.2	 Look, he's looking at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=359.2s	359.2	 He looks at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=360.2s	360.2	 Yeah, if he doesn't look up I'm going to make some other noises just to get his attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=365.2s	365.2	 So he did look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=368.2s	368.2	 And now the click is when his eyes meet mine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=375.2s	375.2	 And now when he's good at that you just get longer and longer eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=381.2s	381.2	 Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=382.2s	382.2	 When he does something right you can also pet him as you feed him the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=386.2s	386.2	 So he gets used to handling it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=388.2s	388.2	 You know, this is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=390.2s	390.2	 This means you did a good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=393.2s	393.2	 Once you have conditioned the positive interrupter noise you can now start adding distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=397.2s	397.2	 If your dog ever ignores you that tells you you've raised criteria too fast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINYw5e0A1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=566&pp=iAQB&t=401.2s	401.2	 or the reinforcements aren't really reinforcing.
