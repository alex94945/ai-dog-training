https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, today I'm going to show you some fun training games that I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 be playing with my little puppy here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 I want to build his confidence with different surfaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=10.3s	10.3	 So I have a couple of different surfaces for this little guy and he's still nameless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=16.6s	16.6	 He just turned nine weeks old a few days ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 So he's not ever walked onto a box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=23.8s	23.8	 So what I can do is just sprinkle some treats on it and it's a little bit more slippery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=27.8s	27.8	 than things that he's been on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=29.6s	29.6	 So I'm just going to feed him some treats for checking out the box and he wanted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=34.9s	34.9	 go onto it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=36.2s	36.2	 So because he was so confident, I can make sure to be holding the box still and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 lure him on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 So you can see his feet are sliding a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=45.1s	45.1	 So he sat on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=47.7s	47.7	 So I wouldn't use a box any taller than this so that they wouldn't just slide as they jumped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=52.6s	52.6	 off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=53.6s	53.6	 So I'm going to put the treat down there to get him off the box and you can see that he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 using his body to go through the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=61.2s	61.2	 So I recently made a video called Agility for Enrichment and Fun and some of this stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=67.1s	67.1	 is actually from that video like this little teeter totter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=73.1s	73.1	 And I'd actually made it for my Chihuahua and then I got a surprise puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 So it's going to be a super fun game for him to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=81.1s	81.1	 Now this has got metal in it so when it's on a hardwood floor it makes a noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=86.3s	86.3	 So it's a really great confidence building exercise for a little puppy because it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=91.8s	91.8	 going to eventually make quite a loud noise for a little puppy but he's very confident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=98.8s	98.8	 So I can help him out by at first making it move slowly when he goes over the part that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 tips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=108.7s	108.7	 And he's very confident with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=112.5s	112.5	 It's probably because we've already been working on having him balance on a balance disc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=117.5s	117.5	 You could also just use a couch cushion or a mattress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 You don't have to buy any of this stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=122.9s	122.9	 Okay, so now he's pretty confident so I'm just going to let him go onto it and let it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=129.1s	129.1	 make that noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 Get it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=133.9s	133.9	 So the weight is distributed so that it's always down on this side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=137.9s	137.9	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=141.4s	141.4	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 And I'm feeding him so that his head is in a natural position like this facing forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=149.4s	149.4	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=150.4s	150.4	 I'm also using release cues because I want him to learn to go onto different objects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=156.8s	156.8	 and weight on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=158.4s	158.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=160.4s	160.4	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 I also don't want him sitting on everything because I would like him to learn to stand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 up on things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 And now for the balance disc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=171.1s	171.1	 So I'm just going to lure him on because he's comfortable with this disc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=175.1s	175.1	 I've had it in the area that he's staying in, his little pen area, so that he can practice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=181.7s	181.7	 wobbling on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=183.4s	183.4	 It's great for teaching balance and building the small muscles in their body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 That is great for preventing injuries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=193.7s	193.7	 So awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=198.8s	198.8	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=199.8s	199.8	 So now I'm going to work on teaching him to put his paws up on a platform like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=206.4s	206.4	 And I have a video of a training session that I worked on with him before on teaching him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=212.4s	212.4	 to follow a lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=213.9s	213.9	 So that's why this is so easy for him because he understands the concept of getting lured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 onto something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=220.1s	220.1	 Great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=221.1s	221.1	 So I'm going to give him a treat over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 And then I'm going to hold my hand up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=225.1s	225.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 He tripped a little bit, poor guy, because he was looking up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=229.7s	229.7	 So I didn't have a treat in my hand that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=232.4s	232.4	 And now I can mark and feed him a treat for staying with his feet up like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=238.2s	238.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 And now I'm going to say free, free, and then reinforce him for getting off of the platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=245.9s	245.9	 And he's super fast for a little guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 So I have to get ready.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 Now I'm going to go back to just feeding him a treat for putting his feet up so he doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=255.4s	255.4	 get confused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=256.4s	256.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 And then I'm going to say free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=261.1s	261.1	 If he was reliably putting his little feet up, I could add a cue such as pause up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=265.7s	265.7	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 Whoa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=268.9s	268.9	 So that wasn't so reliable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=270.3s	270.3	 He thought he had to sit on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=271.5s	271.5	 So I'm not going to add the verbal cue yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=274.2s	274.2	 A lot of people ask me, when do you add the cue?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=276.8s	276.8	 And it's when you reliably see the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 So I would say, like, if you think the puppy is going to do it eight out of 10 times, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=283.9s	283.9	 you could probably add the cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=285.7s	285.7	 But for me, it would be free that you are guessing the puppy is going to do it reliably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=291.6s	291.6	 when you lure like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=299.6s	299.6	 So I can reinforce him for standing on this little platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 And then I can work on going from the stand to the down by pushing the treat at a diagonal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=310.1s	310.1	 in towards him like that, and then get him to stand again by either lifting the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=315.7s	315.7	 at an angle like that, or just holding the treat up here so that he stands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=321.3s	321.3	 So I have my hand right where his face is going to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 So if you're not sure where your dog's face is going to be, you can get them to lay down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 and then hold the hand where their face used to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=332.7s	332.7	 And once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 Oh, he's right on the edge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=337.3s	337.3	 So this is a cat tunnel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=339.2s	339.2	 And you'll see that it was featured in my Agility for Enrichment and Fun video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEKQkAPB9M&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=141&pp=iAQB&t=344.6s	344.6	 And I'm just getting my little pup used to the tunnel by sprinkling treats through it.
