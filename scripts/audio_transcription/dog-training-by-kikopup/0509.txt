https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=3.0s	3.0	 As with any problem behavior, teach your puppy what you do want him to do instead of biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 Dogs use their mouths to interact with their environment, so it is normal for a puppy to want to bite your hands or clothes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 However, in our society it is highly inappropriate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 To train a puppy to stop using their mouth when interacting with humans is simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 All you have to do is set up training scenarios where your puppy would normally start biting and train an alternate response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 Calmly sitting, lying down, standing or walking with a closed mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 First you would start with the least arousing game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 So simply just a reaching hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 As you reach, click or say yes and then feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 As the puppy is successful you can progress to more and more arousing stimulus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 I'm going to touch her and click and feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 That time she actually got, you know, she opened her mouth on my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 But what I want to teach her is that a reaching hand doesn't mean just open your mouth and take it into your mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 It means the predictor of the treat is going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 So hopefully she'll catch on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 That action is not a stimulating action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 It just predicts that a treat is going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 And petting doesn't mean getting excited either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 So hands on you equals clicking the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 And then first you want to start off very, very slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 You don't want to get too excited and do what people are going to do later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 You want to start out with just touch equals treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 Click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 And you have to make sure, you know, the clicker isn't too loud or you'd make a few deaths on your dog or get them to hate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 Hate being touched because you'd make a scary noise when you click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 Another thing you can do is do all the things that your dog usually would lunge and bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 Perhaps if I didn't have treats and I didn't have the clicker right now and I shuffled my feet like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 your dog would go after my shoes and want to chew on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 So I'm going to do the thing that's the stimulus for, you know, for biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 And click the dog for being, working for the treat. Just standing calmly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 Now if the dog were to bite my shoes, I would say, whoops, that was too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 So I'm just going to go to doing step in front of the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 Maybe I can borrow the leash because I know she really wants the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 If your puppy is getting too excited by this game, stop and try again later when the puppy is calmer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 You can also use a lower level reinforcement if your puppy is too excited about the food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 as well as watching my video, Before You Start Training With Food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 The great thing about conditioning handling to be calming and reinforcing rather than exciting and arousing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 is that you can use handling in the future to calm your puppy down when he's too excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Or even as an adult dog, if your dog is fearful or reactive of something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 you can use handling to communicate and tell them everything's fine and calm them down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 Here I am demoing an appropriate way to pet your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 You should respect your dog and stop guests from doing invasive petting as well as over arousing petting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 You should not allow your dog to be manhandled or petted roughly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 Petting should not only be rewarding for the human, but for the dog as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 However, at some point in your dog's life, someone might get to your dog before you can stop them and be overly rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 You can prepare your dog for these situations by playing training games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 But when these situations do occur in real life, respect your dog and get them out of the stressful situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 Do practice handling exercises for grooming as well as vet visits regularly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 He's really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=269.0s	269.0	 Is this the same dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 Yeah, he has changed a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 Well, now we have a lot more time to focus on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 Now what kids might do, I don't know, poke the eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=281.0s	281.0	 Not actually poke the eyes, but you know, mess with him, poke his nose, look at his paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 Yes, you're very good with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 And then go, oh, little puppy, little puppy, hee hee hee hee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 Because that's what people do. They rub them like this and go hee hee hee, pat their ribs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=300.0s	300.0	 And that just means, you know, the human's doing really arousing stuff and you don't get to do much except lay there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 Sadly, that's what happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 Sadly, that's true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=310.0s	310.0	 Okay, it's all done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 Here are some tips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 These exercises should only be done by adults, as children can actually teach dogs to find mouthing and biting fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=320.0s	320.0	 If you want to work with your child as a distraction, have your puppy on leash while you control all interactions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 making sure to end the game if the puppy gets too aroused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 Children under the age of five should never be left alone with a dog or encouraged to interact with their pet dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=335.0s	335.0	 as they cannot control how rough they are and can make your dog learn to not like children as well as it being unsafe for the child.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 Put your puppy on leash and tether him to a door so that you can escape him if you make a mistake by progressing too quickly and elicit mouthing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=350.0s	350.0	 If your puppy starts mouthing you during the training games, it means you've gone too far too quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=355.0s	355.0	 Go back a step and make the game easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 Make sure your puppy can always back away from you so they don't feel trapped or forced when being handled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=363.0s	363.0	 This is because they could start learning to bite out of fear or stress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=367.0s	367.0	 If you have an adult dog or adolescent dog that is mouthy, watch my handling shyness video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 If you must roughhouse with your dog, have a structured game where you hold a toy in each hand that the dog can bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 Never allow your dog to bite your hands when playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=382.0s	382.0	 If you feel teeth, the game ends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=384.0s	384.0	 Always have a cue to start and end the game and never reinforce the dog for starting the game on his own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=391.0s	391.0	 What to do if your puppy bites you outside of a training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 Every time a puppy is reinforced for putting teeth on human skin, a bite reinforcement history is being created.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 Take mouthing seriously and make sure you do not reinforce it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=406.0s	406.0	 Ignoring biting is a bad idea because it is self-reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=410.0s	410.0	 There are many ways to stop biting from being reinforced, so use your judgment as to which technique works best for your puppy to lower his arousal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=419.0s	419.0	 Interrupt and redirect. Call your puppy away from the person being bitten.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 Puppy! Puppy! Puppy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=425.0s	425.0	 And redirect him to a toy or something more appropriate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=428.0s	428.0	 You can also interrupt a bite by simulating the yipe of another puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=432.0s	432.0	 But this can actually have the reverse effect on some puppies and make them want to bite you more, so use your common sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 Remove your attention. Stand up and withdraw your hands if the puppy is biting them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=444.0s	444.0	 Resume when the puppy is calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=446.0s	446.0	 You can also step over a baby gate to prevent interactions until the puppy calms down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=452.0s	452.0	 Calmly pick the puppy up and hold him in a way that his teeth do not reach your skin until he is calmed down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=457.0s	457.0	 You can offer calming signals like yawning and blinking to help him calm down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=461.0s	461.0	 In no way should you do this in a vindictive or threatening manner, as you want to train your dog to trust you and find being restrained calming and reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=470.0s	470.0	 See my video on puppy restraints coming soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiwInd62IP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=510&pp=iAQB&t=474.0s	474.0	 5. Use prevention. If you know your puppy always bites in certain situations, set those situations up as training games first.
