https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone and welcome to Kikopup's dog training tip of the day for today. Now, this is just a tip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=6.2s	6.2	 I do have tutorials already on how to add a verbal cue and to get your dog to respond to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=13.5s	13.5	 Just the verbal cue and not a visual cue from your body. And so this is just a tip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 Okay, so to get started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 I'm gonna get a nice rhythmic picture going and then I'm gonna take away the crutches that are part of the cue and really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=29.6s	29.6	 Make sure that the dog is paying attention to just the verbal cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 So my cue is go jump up and I want him to go and jump up on the couch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 So if I stand like this and say go jump up go jump up go jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=45.5s	45.5	 Cloud go jump up. You can see he doesn't know what it means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=49.5s	49.5	 Without the visual cue. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say the cue go jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 And then I'm gonna throw a treat onto the couch like that mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 Multiple times. I realized I had to put these pillows here so that he can get down without having to jump down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Repetitively because he's got really short legs and he's not really meant to be jumping that high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=72.3s	72.3	 It's great for dogs to jump up but jumping down is when it jams on their on their joints and growth plates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=79.2s	79.2	 Okay, so what I'm gonna do is say my cue go jump up and then throw the treat onto the couch mark and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=87.1s	87.1	 reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 Multiple times so I can also go back over here mark and reinforce him for staying there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 And then I'm gonna tell him to get off the couch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 Right and I can lure him down just so that he doesn't do something ridiculous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=101.9s	101.9	 and then I'm gonna do it again and say go jump up and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 Pretend to throw a treat. I was worried you didn't make it up there mark and reinforce for being up there multiple times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 Good and then I'm gonna say at some point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=120.4s	120.4	 Cloudfree and then lure him down the stairs. Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=124.7s	124.7	 So I'm only giving him one treat here. I gave him two because I was talking but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=130.8s	130.8	 What you want to do when you're playing this game is only give them one treat so they know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=134.8s	134.8	 When I go up there that's when I get a huge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 Quantity of treats so now I'm gonna try saying go jump up and then looking over there without pointing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 Go jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=148.1s	148.1	 Awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=149.9s	149.9	 Throw a party and because you could see I had to say the cue twice and do some little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 Gestures with my body next time. I want to make sure he has the precision back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=160.5s	160.5	 So because I raised criteria by not having a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=164.8s	164.8	 Visual cue for him to look at and just that one part of the cue so it was a different picture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=170.1s	170.1	 I'm gonna lower criteria about how pretty the behavior looks and now because I don't want the behavior free to deteriorate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=177.2s	177.2	 I'm then gonna go back and say go jump up and then make it super easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=182.4s	182.4	 So he gets it a hundred percent right and it looks beautiful and I'm there supporting him all the way so it's fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=190.1s	190.1	 Cloud free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=192.8s	192.8	 Good boy, and then we'll probably do two more because it's a lot of effort for a little dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 I should have chose a smaller object. Are you ready cloud?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=202.5s	202.5	 Go jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 Awesome and you can see he's learned it quite quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=210.3s	210.3	 Because this is a highly ring ring for reinforcing place to be up here. He's getting lots of treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 Free and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=219.2s	219.2	 I'm saying the cue before I did the hand movement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 Are you ready cloud?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 Go jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=228.9s	228.9	 Awesome good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=230.7s	230.7	 Did I say I would do two more? I can't remember if I did two, but I'm only gonna do one more repetition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=236.1s	236.1	 Here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=237.8s	237.8	 free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=239.3s	239.3	 Woohoo, so I'm gonna try and show off. Hopefully it works ready cloud
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=245.6s	245.6	 Uh-oh he's sitting he might be more likely to jump up if he's standing up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 So I'm gonna lure him so that he's standing cloud go jump up. Awesome. Yay

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqaLTJXC4P0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=92&pp=iAQB&t=262.7s	262.7	 It's just a matter of giving the information and making it in small enough steps that your dog
