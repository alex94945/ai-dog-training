https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, I'm going to give you some tips on safety when restraining a dog, picking a dog up, or catching a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Now, a lot of people, they see stuff online and they think, oh, because this person is a professional trainer, then it must be okay for my dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 But sometimes even professional trainers don't know the damage they could do to their dog or haven't gone to a physical therapist to find out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 One of the things that I've seen a lot, even with really positive trainers, is that when they restrain their dog to get their dog excited,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 they're restraining their dog by the collar and even lifting the dog off the ground by the collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 Now, the problem with that is that their dog's necks are made just like ours, so if you were to put a leash around your neck and then hang forwards,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 that's basically what's happening to the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 When dogs are very aroused, they will act as though they're not in pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 So if you can imagine in your living room, if you were to go over, grab your dog's collar and just lift them off the ground by it, they're not going to like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 But when they're excited, they want the toy, they want to do protection work, they want to do fly ball, they're not going to tell you that it's hurting their neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 So the best way to restrain a dog is in front of their shoulders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 You could even pick them off the ground if you wanted and say, ready, steady, are you going to, going to, going to, go, go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 Yeah, awesome. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 Another thing is when you pick your dog up, you don't want to pick, wait, you don't want to pick your dog up by the stomach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 You want to pick your dog up by the chest and behind their legs like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 And that's the same way you would want to catch your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 You don't want to catch them where their weight is landing on their delicate stomach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Are you ready? So ready, wish. There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 You can see I've got my hand around her butt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 What I also like to do is have the dog jump up on my legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 So see how I have it forwards like this, jump up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 So she's basically standing on my leg and then I'm just supporting her like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 Jump up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 Jump up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876vxILLLGY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=321&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 Good girl. Get it.
