https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, here's just a quick tip on reading dogs. Now oftentimes you'll read
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 something about how dogs act in certain circumstances but just because it says
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=10.9s	10.9	 the dog acts this way when they feel this way it doesn't necessarily mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=14.6s	14.6	 that is how your dog is feeling at that specific time. Now as you can see here my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=19.7s	19.7	 Chihuahua is shivering and it's actually because it's very cold in this room and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=24.7s	24.7	 the other dogs are not shivering but she's shivering because she's cold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 Another thing she does when she's cold is she holds her tail between her legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 So you can see that while she's sitting here like this she's got her tail tucked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=36.4s	36.4	 and oftentimes dogs with very little hair they'll put their tail between their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=40.4s	40.4	 legs to keep themselves warmer so it doesn't necessarily mean that the dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=45.7s	45.7	 feeling fearful or scared if they're shivering and they have their tail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=49.5s	49.5	 between their legs. It could simply just mean that the dog is cold. Another type
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=54.3s	54.3	 of behavior that dogs do is they'll shiver when they're excited so maybe the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=59.1s	59.1	 dog is excited for food or a toy and they start to shiver because of that. The
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 second behavior that oftentimes gets misinterpreted is that the dog has a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 relaxed and open mouth. Now that is commonly described in dog training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 literature as a dog that's relaxed and not very stressed. However you have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=76.7s	76.7	 look at the whole picture. So if you're in a cold environment or a cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=80.5s	80.5	 environment and the dog has done no exercise they shouldn't have their mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 open because that's their way of reducing the heat in their body. Their

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 of their mouths are closed and if they were to suddenly start panting that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=98.1s	98.1	 would be the sign that something has changed in the dog. So maybe they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=102.4s	102.4	 feeling more stressed or more excited. So an open mouth doesn't necessarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=107.7s	107.7	 mean that the dog is relaxed. If a dog is in a cool environment and they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=111.3s	111.3	 done no exercise and say you're in a shelter and you enter the room and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=115.3s	115.3	 suddenly the dog starts panting it could actually be a sign that the dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 stressed by you. Now conversely if a dog were panting and then they suddenly did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=124.6s	124.6	 close their mouth it could be the sign that the dog is concerned or smelling

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=134.5s	134.5	 If you have a very hairy dog and you're out in the sun and your dog gets hot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=138.4s	138.4	 easily they're gonna be panting more or if you have a dog that is not physically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=143.3s	143.3	 fit they're gonna pant faster, be more likely to pant faster when they start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 doing exercise than a dog that is physically fit. Another example is my

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=271&pp=iAQB&t=158.3s	158.3	 when she's doing exercise unless it's over a hundred degrees. I call her the
