https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone! Along with posting my own video tutorials to this YouTube channel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 I've decided to host trainers who I greatly admire and who are experts in their field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=10.4s	10.4	 Today, I am honored to be hosting Mara Veles on the topic of dog play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=15.8s	15.8	 So I hope you enjoy her expertise and insight on this topic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=20.5s	20.5	 Mara Veles is a certified professional dog trainer and also the executive director of the Shelter Playgroup Alliance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 You can find out more about her and the Shelter Playgroup Alliance in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 Hi, my name is Mara Veles and I am the executive director of Shelter Playgroup Alliance and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 I'd like to thank Emily for inviting me on the Kikopup YouTube channel to talk about dog play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=50.8s	50.8	 So when we think about dog play, we want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=55.7s	55.7	 consider what good looks like probably first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 and then I'll contrast that with what might be a little concerning behaviors and when we need to intervene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=66.1s	66.1	 And then I'll show you some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=69.1s	69.1	 demonstrations of the process for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=72.5s	72.5	 helping dogs get to good and assessing whether dogs want to play with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 So first thing is that dog play is actually most often,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=86.6s	86.6	 at least good play, is most often between two dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=90.6s	90.6	 So if you think about your own social interactions and when you have the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=97.5s	97.5	 conversations with friends, I mean the best connection with friends,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=102.4s	102.4	 that's usually one-on-one. It's hard to manage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=107.2s	107.2	 having a really good interaction with a group of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=111.2s	111.2	 So similarly, good dog play just generally occurs in a dyad or in a pair too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=118.7s	118.7	 The next thing that we look for is that the bodies are loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 So what does loose look like? It means that the musculature is nice and relaxed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 that there's a lot of curvature and bending in the spine. So we see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=135.4s	135.4	 C curves in the spine quite often,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 that the weight shifts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=141.8s	141.8	 when a dog is moving, their weight shifts are fluid and intentional,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=147.2s	147.2	 that they're not super stiff and moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=151.3s	151.3	 One of the other things that actually might be a little bit of a surprise to a lot of people is that there is a break
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 taking about every 30 seconds, which is interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=162.2s	162.2	 So the pace of the play will look like play, play, play, pause, play, play, play, pause,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=168.4s	168.4	 and then maybe a longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=171.7s	171.7	 half a second, full second as opposed to a fraction of a second pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=176.9s	176.9	 And then oftentimes there's a couple of minutes of play and then the dogs walk away and do something different and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=184.5s	184.5	 then they re-engage. So we want to see lots of space given and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 breaks taken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=192.5s	192.5	 to give us an indication that that's a really good play pair, that the two dogs are listening to each other well and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=200.2s	200.2	 respecting each other's boundaries and then giving each other a break every once in a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 The other component, so I was just kind of talking about space, but also like during the play,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=213.8s	213.8	 not that the dogs are separating completely, but that they are giving each other a bit of space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=220.1s	220.1	 whether they're jaw wrestling, they're not fully engaging and gripping and holding for long periods of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 that there's some air space between the dogs physically. Also, if they're like running and chasing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=235.1s	235.1	 or even if they're doing some ground wrestling, there's a little bit of space in between the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 So that airspace is a really important component.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 And then the next thing is that there is a lot of shifting of what the dogs are doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 While dogs may have some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=256.3s	256.3	 preferences for the things that they like to be able to do, so some dogs prefer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 chase or wrestling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=265.9s	265.9	 or jaw wrestling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=269.8s	269.8	 when dogs are interacting with each other really nicely, they will be really flexible with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=276.2s	276.2	 So they'll negotiate what that play looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=279.4s	279.4	 So we want to see regular shifts in activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=283.4s	283.4	 So we hear this concept of a play style quite often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=288.9s	288.9	 So there's no real evidence for play styles per se, that a dog will do this one thing only,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=296.8s	296.8	 but usually that super repetitive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=300.1s	300.1	 activity is a good indication that things aren't going well in play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 So let's then shift to thinking about what not good play looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=312.1s	312.1	 Not good play is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=314.7s	314.7	 we often see it in large groups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=317.6s	317.6	 So we see the dogs are overwhelmed. They're not super relaxed in a larger group setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 So quite often we might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=327.1s	327.1	 see in a dog park if things are going well, dogs may
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=332.1s	332.1	 find a playmate that is a good match for them and then they might go off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=337.3s	337.3	 So it's not that having groups of dogs is a bad thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=341.7s	341.7	 where there is enough space for them to get away from each other and select out a good playmate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=347.9s	347.9	 But larger groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=350.1s	350.1	 of dogs, like four or five dogs that are interacting with each other,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=355.2s	355.2	 usually is not a good indication of play or appropriate play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=361.7s	361.7	 Another thing that we look at, so in contrast to those loose spines and loose musculature, are tense bodies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=369.1s	369.1	 So the muscular tension,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=372.1s	372.1	 if you think about when you're in a social setting and you're a little worried,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 your shoulders may get really tense,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=380.8s	380.8	 your core may get tense, and then that gives us an aligned spine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=387.4s	387.4	 Similarly with dogs, so if their bodies are really tense, then we see that absence of curvature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=394.4s	394.4	 We see some spinal alignment and when the dog is walking, often they're walking as if they're really stiff and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=401.1s	401.1	 worried about things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=404.1s	404.1	 Another aspect of not good play is that there's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=408.8s	408.8	 break-taking, so that they're doing the same thing over and over and over again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=414.3s	414.3	 without taking breaks, without giving the other dog a little bit of space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=420.7s	420.7	 Similarly, and this often happens at the same time in those not good play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=427.9s	427.9	 interactions or not play interactions, is that one dog is pursuing another, that the enjoyment is just one-sided.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=434.5s	434.5	 So one dog's like, I really want to interact with you, and the other dog's like, I'm not so sure about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=440.2s	440.2	 Hey, maybe you can give me some space or if I'll interact with you if we do this thing, but not that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=446.9s	446.9	 So when we see enjoyment is just one-sided, then that's an indication that we should probably take a break
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=453.9s	453.9	 and remove the dogs and then see if we can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=457.3s	457.3	 help them learn. We definitely can teach good play operantly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=462.0s	462.0	 help them learn to interact with each other appropriately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=466.2s	466.2	 So now that we've discussed what good play and not good play looks like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=471.8s	471.8	 you're wondering how to start that process and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=475.8s	475.8	 ensure that your dog or a dog that's in your care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=480.1s	480.1	 is matched with an appropriate playmate and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=483.7s	483.7	 that the play is managed well. I had mentioned that we can operantly teach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=489.2s	489.2	 good play with social dogs who are interested in being around other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=496.5s	496.5	 Our first step is to make sure that we have all of the things that we need in order to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=504.8s	504.8	 do that well. So a couple of things that probably not be surprising is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=510.4s	510.4	 have a treat pouch that has food in it because we want to reinforce or reward

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=559.0s	559.0	 And so you get the dog's attention and then they turn their head back to you and then you reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=565.6s	565.6	 So that's the basic setup for what's on you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=570.4s	570.4	 and then what you have on you and then what the dog has on them is a harness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=576.3s	576.3	 and a leash.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=585.0s	585.0	 corrections or any pressure around the neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=588.6s	588.6	 But if your dog isn't comfortable in a harness and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=591.2s	591.2	 they're okay on a flat collar,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=595.8s	595.8	 that's okay. It's not the worst, but definitely prefer a harness with a back clip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=603.6s	603.6	 because we're not directing the dog. So if we have a front clip harness,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=607.9s	607.9	 the idea is that they're pulling in one direction and that they're being sort of redirected

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=617.8s	617.8	 means that it's a safety, so that you're holding onto the dog for safety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=623.0s	623.0	 and not letting them sort of rush up on the other dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=646.8s	646.8	 That means that there is a secure fence or barrier between the two dogs, that they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=653.2s	653.2	 visibility between the two of them so that they can see each other's body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=658.0s	658.0	 We start a little ways away and because we want to see, we want to slowly walk the dogs to each
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=665.0s	665.0	 other and we want to be able to see any shifts in behavior. So as the dog is approaching the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=671.6s	671.6	 dog, are they giving any indications that they're uncomfortable with the dog that they're being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=677.2s	677.2	 introduced to? So we want to look for any head turns away, any full body turns away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=684.6s	684.6	 excessive sniffing on the ground, anything that we might catalog as a displacement behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=691.2s	691.2	 So we want to make sure that that dog is nice and relaxed, that they're comfortable, they see that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=696.7s	696.7	 other dog, they're interested in meeting them, but we're putting some barriers in place so that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=713.1s	713.1	 The dogs are very aware that there is much more safety behind a fence, so that sets them up for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=720.3s	720.3	 a nice and relaxed initial greeting. So let's say that everything is going really nicely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=726.5s	726.5	 that the dog sees the other dog, they're nice and loose. As you're approaching, you can squeak the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=733.2s	733.2	 squeaker or say the dog's name and then they orient you. So we want to see that as you're making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=742.8s	742.8	 the approach that they're able to be redirected towards you, that they're not so focused on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=749.4s	749.4	 other dog, that they can't have their attention diverted. So we want to do a couple of attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=755.6s	755.6	 diverting just to test that and make sure that's an assessment of their arousal level in greeting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=762.4s	762.4	 that other dog. So we want them to be like a relatively calm, like, oh hey, how's it going?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=768.7s	768.7	 Not like, oh my god! Right? So nobody wants to be greeted like that. I'm a pretty high extrovert,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=778.5s	778.5	 I don't even want to be greeted like that. So we want, you know, just a, oh hey, how's it going?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=786.4s	786.4	 Greet. So that, oh hey, how's it going? Greet is a slower walk up to, we want to be able to redirect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=794.5s	794.5	 their attention, and then we allow a couple of seconds at the fence and then assess what their

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=806.8s	806.8	 talked about earlier, where we want to see the spine's nice and loose, we want to see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=812.2s	812.2	 the musculature nice and relaxed. We'd like to see that maybe there's a play bow, there doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=819.5s	819.5	 necessarily need to be a play bow, but when we're looking from behind, because that's going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=825.0s	825.0	 our view when we're holding the leash, if we look from behind, we want to see that that spine is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=830.5s	830.5	 nice and flexible, that the tail is wagging nice and wide, and so that there's a nice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=839.7s	839.7	 that the tail is kind of wagging the dog, and that's a really good indication of high affiliation or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=846.5s	846.5	 real positive interest with that other dog. So we'll take a look at what that looks like now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=855.2s	855.2	 So you see that these two dogs are interested in each other, that's an example of that really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=862.3s	862.3	 wide tail wag where it looks like the tail is wagging the dog, and we also see that we're able

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=876.4s	876.4	 seconds at the fence, and then take a break and then come back to the fence. So we're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=883.2s	883.2	 take a break and then come back to the fence. So we're looking for, just like this dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=889.8s	889.8	 demonstrating to us, some really nice soft body, some really lovely greeting behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=901.1s	901.1	 Here's another example of a fence greet that I'm testing to see if she can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=908.0s	908.0	 come back to me from looking at that other dog. You see that she's super excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=914.9s	914.9	 in greeting the other dog. This is some of the behavior that we want to see, some really loose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=920.4s	920.4	 and bouncy bodies, but before I bring her into the next step, which is in semi-protected contact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=929.2s	929.2	 which is with leashes, I want to see that she can get her attention diverted from that other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=938.2s	938.2	 So then what's next? So we have a semi-protected contact greet. So we take the dogs on their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=946.8s	946.8	 harnesses and leashes and bring them into the space together. So semi-protected contact means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=953.3s	953.3	 that there is a handler who is attached to the leash, holding the leash, and which is attached

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=964.6s	964.6	 still some amount of safety that is in play, just like our fence provided quite a bit of safety,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=973.3s	973.3	 the harness and leash provides a level of safety as well. So if the dogs get uncomfortable with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=979.3s	979.3	 each other, that they're easily separated. So when we're bringing the dogs in for the semi-protected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=986.3s	986.3	 contact greet, then we're looking for the same behavior. So we want to see that the bodies are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=991.6s	991.6	 nice and loose, and that the musculature is nice and relaxed, that the spines are nice and relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1000.8s	1000.8	 We want to also see that the dogs are greeting each other about two seconds in the butt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1006.4s	1006.4	 two seconds in the face. Don't want anything super extended. It would be just like somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1013.6s	1013.6	 shaking your hand for an excessive period of time, probably like more than two or three seconds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1019.5s	1019.5	 starts to feel a little uncomfortable. So same too with dogs. So the most polite greeting is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1028.3s	1028.3	 about two seconds at the butt, two seconds at the face. So if we see that a dog is sniffing for too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1035.6s	1035.6	 long, then we can still use our same redirect. So we can ask for the attention to be put on us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1043.0s	1043.0	 So we reinforce that. So we can either use our squeaker or our voice, whatever our recall is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1052.8s	1052.8	 for the dog, and then ask them to turn back to us, break that greeting, and then we can come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1061.9s	1061.9	 to sniffing, to either greeting that other dog, or then the next thing that we'd want to see

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1077.1s	1077.1	 would like to do something else with the dog in the presence. So a good interaction doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1084.4s	1084.4	 necessarily even mean that the dogs are playing together. It's that they're hanging out. They're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1089.5s	1089.5	 going and investigating things together. So all of that is still really good. Any positive interactions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1097.1s	1097.1	 between the dogs, it doesn't necessarily need to be a play type interaction for it to be a good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1108.7s	1108.7	 greets. In this interaction, we have two young dogs who are going to meet each other in semi-protected
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1117.3s	1117.3	 contact. So you see the a little bit younger dog coming in, and I'm the one who's holding the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1126.0s	1126.0	 brindle dog. So the brindle dog is a little bit bigger, so we want to keep him from overwhelming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1133.4s	1133.4	 that the little younger pup. You see that every time that he's looking, I'm feeding, and I'm just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1139.5s	1139.5	 using the leash as a safety mechanism and also not allowing him to go too far. In our next interaction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1149.9s	1149.9	 you see two adult dogs. You see this lovely girl here who is going to meet a little chihuahua.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1158.8s	1158.8	 So we see that couple seconds. So a couple seconds at the butt, and he's going in for a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1165.6s	1165.6	 longer of a sniff than she'd like. So we're just moving them away and then reinforcing her for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1173.8s	1173.8	 coming back. So not a horrible greeting, but the chihuahua went a little long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1180.6s	1180.6	 So after those initial greets, so after that phase of initially greeting, and we see that the dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1187.8s	1187.8	 are still really interested in interacting with each other, then we can shift into a more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1194.5s	1194.5	 play management type phase of the of the greeting. So if we look at the phases as being kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1202.0s	1202.0	 three phases, semi-protected contact, semi-protected contact, and then play management.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1208.5s	1208.5	 So in play management, we're going to be looking for the time when we can perhaps drop leashes and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1217.7s	1217.7	 have leashes drag for a little while. So if everybody, if the dogs are playing nicely with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1225.2s	1225.2	 each other, then we look for the moment that we feel really comfortable that is going to go pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1231.6s	1231.6	 well, that they're able to be, so the criteria for that is that they're responding to our prompts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1239.2s	1239.2	 to move away from the other dog or taking breaks on their own so that we can reinforce breaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1245.8s	1245.8	 And then the next step is if we're seeing that all of that is going well for a couple of minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1253.6s	1253.6	 and then we can take the leashes off. So we leave the leashes as a drag, as a drag line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1261.2s	1261.2	 as a way of providing some amount of safety. So if we need to pick up the leashes and direct the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1267.0s	1267.0	 dogs away from each other, that we have that option, that it's an easy option. And then if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1274.0s	1274.0	 everything goes well, then we look to removing the leashes. So again, we're, you know, we're prompting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1282.5s	1282.5	 lots of breaks. So every couple of minutes that we're taking a little bit of a break and then,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1288.7s	1288.7	 then feeding the dogs, doing maybe a couple of asking them to do a couple of operant behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1294.7s	1294.7	 that they know, either targeting or sitting or, you know, a spin or, you know, whatever sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1300.3s	1300.3	 trick that they may have learned. So you can prompt a number of behaviors. When we're prompting those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1308.0s	1308.0	 behaviors, then we're also looking for their arousal level to return to some level of baseline. So that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1317.1s	1317.1	 interrupting the play behaviors is a really good arousal management tool so that the play doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1324.1s	1324.1	 get like super excited. And then the dog starts to get into repetitive type of behaviors or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1331.4s	1331.4	 that there's the space closes a little bit, or they start biting a little bit harder. So that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1337.5s	1337.5	 really the impact of arousal or not managing arousal is that the play can kind of go sideways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1344.4s	1344.4	 So if we want to keep the play safe, then we manage that arousal really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1349.6s	1349.6	 So let's look at a couple of examples of that. So here's a great example of two dogs who
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1357.1s	1357.1	 are greeting each other for the first time, they already had their protected contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1361.6s	1361.6	 greet, now they're coming in for semi protected contact. They're very interested in each other,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1366.8s	1366.8	 look at those bodies are just sort of flipping around. So nice musculature, nice relaxed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1374.9s	1374.9	 musculature, the bodies are kind of bouncing around. We don't see one dog really overwhelming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1385.0s	1385.0	 the other dog, we did see that that striped dog was kind of pursuing he, you know, put his paw over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1393.5s	1393.5	 And then that was a little bit of a break. So it gave the handlers an opportunity to pick up the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1400.1s	1400.1	 leashes and force a little break, and then see if the dogs want to go back to each other. So asking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1407.2s	1407.2	 whether the dogs want to go back to each other is what we call a consent test. So if one dog starts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1413.3s	1413.3	 to avoid the other dog by turning their head away, then we would interrupt but in this case,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1421.2s	1421.2	 both of the dogs are interested in continuing the interaction. So the handlers are dropping the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1427.6s	1427.6	 leashes and then picking them up as they need to. So we see some investigation on the part of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1437.2s	1437.2	 black dog and then re engagement of like, hey, how's it going? This, this is a little bit of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1445.2s	1445.2	 prolonged sniff. So that's a little bit rude, but the lighter color dog doesn't seem to mind too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1454.5s	1454.5	 He's allowing that to happen and then turns and then we have some play solicitation from the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1463.2s	1463.2	 two dogs or then giving them an opportunity to to interact with each other and then still take breaks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1471.9s	1471.9	 come back to a handler and get some food. And so through this slow process of introducing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1480.0s	1480.0	 taking lots of breaks, then we see that the dogs are learning how to do that on their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1489.6s	1489.6	 So we have the lighter, the darker color dog is coming back and then looking at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1501.0s	1501.0	 the lighter color dog. And this is really what we want to see between the interactions that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1507.2s	1507.2	 both enjoying each other. You look at her tail has a nice wide sweep that she's not on that. Neither
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1515.0s	1515.0	 of the dogs are on top of each other, but they're enjoying sharing space with each other. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1523.2s	1523.2	 they have some moments of play. So this is actually what appropriate play looks like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1531.1s	1531.1	 is a little bit of bouncy interactions and then moving away from each other, a little bit of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1537.6s	1537.6	 bouncy interactions and then moving away from each other. And this is that space that I'm talking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1544.5s	1544.5	 about. So again, I want to thank Emily for inviting me as a guest on the Kikopup YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1554.0s	1554.0	 channel to talk about dog play. We actually do some shelter playgroup alliance, the organization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1561.3s	1561.3	 that I'm the executive director of. We have a lot of resources for you. So if the dogs that are in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1568.3s	1568.3	 your care are not playing similarly to the dogs that you saw today, then we do have some guidelines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1575.7s	1575.7	 So again, play is a behavior, appropriate play is a behavior that you can shape. So you can teach it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQP2Z9z9jQ0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=176&pp=iAQB&t=1584.0s	1584.0	 through operant conditioning. So we do have our guidelines that are on our website, shelter dog
