https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This is my dog training tip of the day for today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 Should you tug with your dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=7.2s	7.2	 In my opinion, yes, you should tug with your dog because it's a way of interacting with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=10.8s	10.8	 your dog and reinforcing your dog with something that you have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=14.6s	14.6	 However, the problem with tugging can be that you build arousal and you never want to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=20.5s	20.5	 over arousal in your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 So when you're going to tug with your dog, you want to reinforce them when they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=25.6s	25.6	 over aroused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 So when you see that your dog's over aroused, you're just going to put the tug away in some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=30.1s	30.1	 drawer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=31.1s	31.1	 But when you see your dog acting pretty calm, slightly aroused, then you can say, okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 get it, and let them tug on the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 You also want to teach your dog to let go of the toy when you ask them to because if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=43.3s	43.3	 the game's getting too aroused, you're reinforcing them for being over excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=48.2s	48.2	 So as long as they're not excited, the game continues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=50.9s	50.9	 If they get too excited, the game ends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=53.7s	53.7	 Splash already knows how to drop, but I'm going to show you how you would teach that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 You put food in their nose, click, when they let go, and then feed them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=62.5s	62.5	 Once they've got that down, if the treat's not working, get a better treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=66.3s	66.3	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=67.3s	67.3	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=68.3s	68.3	 Get the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=69.3s	69.3	 They might not want to get the toy if you use a really good treat, and then you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=71.5s	71.5	 use a less valuable one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 But when they've forgotten that you have a treat, they start tugging again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 You put the treat on their nose and say drop, click, and feed them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 You want to, that click was a little slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=83.4s	83.4	 You want to click them for actual letting go of the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=87.1s	87.1	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=88.1s	88.1	 So now, after you've done that maybe 20 times, you're going to say drop, click the dog for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 dropping and feed them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=96.6s	96.6	 The final step is they get the toy, get it, get it, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 You say drop, good girl, okay, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 And the reward is to get the toy again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 Drop, get it, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 Now you can prove the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=113.4s	113.4	 They only get the toy when you say get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=115.9s	115.9	 If they try to get the toy before you say get it, simply don't let them get the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=119.9s	119.9	 Okay, get it, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 Okay, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 Ha ha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 Wee hee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 Another thing you don't want to do is move their head around too much because you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 hurt their neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 So nice pulling back action is good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=141.1s	141.1	 Side to side a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=143.7s	143.7	 Lifting them up, but you don't want to swing them around because that's going to put too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 much pressure on their, I don't know, on their neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=151.3s	151.3	 Ha ha ha ha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=153.8s	153.8	 Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=154.8s	154.8	 Now you can incorporate the toy as a reward for doing behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=159.1s	159.1	 Whoopas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=160.1s	160.1	 Okay, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=161.1s	161.1	 Ha ha.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=163.1s	163.1	 Another tip is if you have a high value toy, you want to hide it so that the dogs still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=169.5s	169.5	 find it really exciting every time you bring it out and they'll be more likely to want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 to play with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l8Qv1htUY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=555&pp=iAQB&t=174.8s	174.8	 Get it, keep going.
