https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 So if the dog gets up, you need to slow down the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 You also don't want to make it more and more exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=13.4s	13.4	 So if he's good with one step, then two steps and three steps, then running around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=17.5s	17.5	 You want to keep going back to where it's easy for the puppy so you don't mess up and the puppy gets overexcited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=25.5s	25.5	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 So I'm going to take a couple steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=31.8s	31.8	 Jiggle the fabric a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=40.6s	40.6	 When the puppy's doing really well, you can make the distraction, wait a little bit, then mark and feed the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 Or do the distraction for longer increments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56FceSUHAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=23&pp=iAQB&t=49.6s	49.6	 So you might walk a step and mark as you make the first step, but then you might make a couple more steps before marking and reinforcing.
