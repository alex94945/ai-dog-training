https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=5.1s	5.1	 with shy, reactive, and over-excited dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 It's called giving into leash pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=11.1s	11.1	 At first when you put pressure on a leash, dogs can get either over-excited, over-aroused,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 on a leash, it means move with me instead of move away from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 Naturally, dogs tend to move in the opposite direction when you put pressure on the leash,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 This is Gremlin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=52.2s	52.2	 She's my friend's new rescue dog from Spain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 She's about seven months old, and she's very scared and reactive in the city.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=59.6s	59.6	 So we're going to practice in this calm environment where she feels comfortable, how to give into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=63.9s	63.9	 leash pressure, so that when she's got the behavior down, she can start using it in the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ygmQ4mRWfM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=393&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 If your dog is very scared of being handled and touched, you want to do the exercises
