https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=4.0s	4.0	 In this video tutorial, I'm going to show you how to do a calming chin rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 Now this can be beneficial to many types of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 For example, reactive dogs, shy dogs, overexcited dogs, and easily distracted dogs like this dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 She gets easily distracted, especially in the forest, or if she hears something scary, some scary noises, then she can become very, very distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 So teaching a calming chin rest can be a great way to reconnect with your dog in a situation where your dog is having trouble paying attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 It can also help to calm the dog down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 Now, just grabbing your dog's chin is not very calming at all, and it increases your dog's stress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 So I'm not saying to grab your dog's chin. It's a behavior that your dog offers to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 The dog puts their chin in your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 Now you can teach this as an excitable trick using clicker training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 Here's Kiko, my chihuahua, demoing a trick chin rest where she gets very excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 But in this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to teach a calming chin rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 I'm not going to use a clicker when teaching this behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 One, because it's very hard to hold a clicker and touch your dog and feed your dog, unless you have a helper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 But also, if you use the clicker in an exciting way, like for agility or for teaching very excitable canine freestyle or arousing obedience exercises, like fast recalls,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 the dog can have a conditioned response to the sound of the clicker, which is arousal and excitement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 And then if you're trying to work on something calm, it's hard to avoid that scenario of your dog getting excited when they hear the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 So, Lacey has had about one or two training sessions on working on putting her chin in a palm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 And the first step you'd want to do with teaching a chin rest is teaching your dog to find you reaching under their chin comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 Now we've worked with Lacey on this when she was a puppy, so she was very comfortable with us reaching under her chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 But I'll start and show you each step to teaching your dog to be comfortable with having your hand under their chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 If you have an extremely shy dog, work on the exercise touch first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 Another great exercise that you can do before you start doing a calm chin rest is teaching your dog to settle and be calm around food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 And you can see how to do that in my video, Capturing Calmness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 Because if you have a dog that's highly aroused by food, just the presence of the food is making your dog aroused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 And how can you condition some calmness with a chin rest if your dog is over the top already because you have a handful of hot dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 The first step is simply reaching yes and saying yes or yep as you reach towards your dog. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 Then move to feed the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 You don't want to do them both at the same time because look where the dog's eyes are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 The predictor that I'm going to give Lacey the treat is my hand moving and she's already starting to offer some funny behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 Ready? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 So if your dog were to back up as you reach for their chin, simply go back a step. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 And start reaching from a distance. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 Step two. Touch and feed at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 So to start out, to get him used to it, at first they might be a little scared when you touch them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 And you've done an amazing job because I can touch them with the chin today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 But at first you're going to feed and touch him so that he's getting used to the hands being on his face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 Because if you just try to reach yes and then feed, what if he didn't like it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 He might back up and be like, what did you just do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 So you're going to start by feeding him and touching him at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 If you have a dog that is fearful or handshy, use neutral body postures as you do this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 Also make sure to blink slowly and look away from your dog often so that your dog doesn't feel intimidated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 So you want to be either maybe standing to the side as you do it or sitting like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 But not leaning and then coming like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 Step three. Reach, touch, say yes and then feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 With your dog in front of you, reach forwards and touch your dog's chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 Use your marker word and then move to feed your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 Step four. Add eye contact and increase duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=295.0s	295.0	 Now I'm going to reach and keep my hand underneath her chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=300.0s	300.0	 Yes. And say yes for her accepting me keeping my hand there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=304.0s	304.0	 Good job. Yes. Yes. Yum, yum, yum. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 So you can see she's looking at my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=317.0s	317.0	 So now the next step after she's accepting having my hand under her chin is getting some eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 So I can make a little kissy noise. Yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=330.0s	330.0	 And the moment you want to say yes is when your dog's eyes are looking at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=333.0s	333.0	 As you can see when I move my hand, some of the eyes will move away from my eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 So I want to make sure that I say yes before I move my hand. Yes. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=346.0s	346.0	 Yes. So he's very smart. Now he's doing it without me asking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 Yes. And I can feed him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 Step five. Get the dog to offer the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=360.0s	360.0	 Okay. Now the dog is very comfortable with the chin rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=365.0s	365.0	 You can start to see if the dog will offer the chin rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=368.0s	368.0	 Now you can either free shape the behavior where you simply offer your hand and see if the dog, yes, will put their chin in your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 Now you're going to lower criteria. So you're just going to yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 Say yes for the chin going in your hand but not also the eye contact because asking for the chin and eye contact would be very hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 and your dog might just give up and say, hey, you're making things too hard and walk away or get frustrated, whine, bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=394.0s	394.0	 So if your dog can't offer putting their chin in your hand, there's a way that you can lure it using a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=401.0s	401.0	 And I'll show you that with Lacey. It's much easier if your dog is sitting or laying down when you do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 because if they're up and about, they'll be moving about and it'll be harder to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=411.0s	411.0	 Ready? Lacey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=415.0s	415.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=417.0s	417.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 If they think you're asking for paw, just ignore that and try to be a little quicker with getting your hand underneath their chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=425.0s	425.0	 Or you can distract them with the treat, put your hand underneath their chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=430.0s	430.0	 Good job. And then while they're eating, then you can start luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=433.0s	433.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=434.0s	434.0	 So I am bringing my hand up from up here to down with my other hand underneath the chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=449.0s	449.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=452.0s	452.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=454.0s	454.0	 The next step is getting further and further away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=457.0s	457.0	 She also has a trick where I do that and she puts her two paws up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=461.0s	461.0	 So she's got to learn that, oh, it's not about that, it's about the chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=465.0s	465.0	 And I'm not going to say no when she does that because I don't want to punish her because that can have some side effects that I really don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=473.0s	473.0	 So, Lacey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=475.0s	475.0	 I'm just going to ignore it and try and reinforce the behavior that I do want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=479.0s	479.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=481.0s	481.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=483.0s	483.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=485.0s	485.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=486.0s	486.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=487.0s	487.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=488.0s	488.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1DORI9bDBU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=383&pp=iAQB&t=490.0s	490.0	 Also, if I get her to stand up, she might not offer the paw movement.
