https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=7.9s	7.9	 Now, it's a very simple game, but most people don't often play it this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 Usually when you want to get your dog interested in finding grooming a positive experience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 the dog is stationary and then what happens is these new objects are moved towards the dog and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=25.3s	25.3	 touch the dog and for some dogs this isn't the best first start to being introduced to grooming equipment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=32.3s	32.3	 So instead I suggest playing this game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=34.8s	34.8	 which is the grooming recall game that I play with young puppies and adult dogs to build their positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 association with the way the tools look and the way the tools sound. In this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 you'll see me conditioning a positive emotional response to the sight and the sound of the grooming equipment with my new puppy, Halo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=55.2s	55.2	 The game is very simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=56.6s	56.6	 You simply pick up the equipment and then move away from your dog, mark and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=61.2s	61.2	 reinforce your dog for moving towards the equipment. So you're basically playing a keep away game with the equipment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=67.8s	67.8	 If you're using equipment that makes noise such as a nail trimmer or a dremel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=72.2s	72.2	 you can drop a treat for your dog and then move 15 feet or 20 feet away and then make the noise of the tool in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=79.1s	79.1	 very soft manner before then encouraging your puppy or dog to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=83.5s	83.5	 So you might click the nail clippers very gently as the dog is further at a distance and he's just finished his treat and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 then you're gonna say pop up up up and then mark and reinforce for the dog moving towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 You don't want to make the noise as the dog gets to you at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=98.2s	98.2	 You want to make the noise while the dog is at a distance and you're moving away from the dog as you make the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 noise and then encouraging your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=105.2s	105.2	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=107.2s	107.2	 Once your dog is responding happily with a positive emotional response to the noise at a low level and can move straight at you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 excitedly expecting his treat without any reservation, you can start increasing the level of the noise as well as the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=122.4s	122.4	 duration of how long the noise is going. So if you have a dog that is at a distance, you can move away from the dog and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=129.1s	129.1	 start increasing the level of the noise as well as the duration of how long the noise is going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 So if you have the Dremel, you can start to have the Dremel go for a longer period of time before the dog reaches you to get his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=141.5s	141.5	 treat and then you can also have the Dremel at a louder or more intense volume.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=147.1s	147.1	 Good job!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0XEr4DGfs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=216&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 Oh, bye! This is very loud!
