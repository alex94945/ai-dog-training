https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=4.0s	4.0	 This is my dog training tip of the day for today. How to teach your dog their name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 Sometimes a name can be useful if you have more than one dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 I just recently named my puppy Tug, but I haven't yet started calling him that. I've been calling him Puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 So right now I'm going to show you how I'm going to teach Tug his new name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 He probably thinks his name is Puppy. Who knows?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 Okay, so I'll show you with Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 All you have to do is say the name Kiko and then give them a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 Kiko treat. Tug treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 In the next clip you'll see Tug try to get Kiko's treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 Instead of saying no, I'm simply going to lift the treat back up again until he's backed away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 If the problem kept happening, I could put him on leash or go back to clicking or saying yes for him standing calmly to watch Kiko get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 You will also see that if Tug's paws leave the ground while I'm giving him a treat, I remove the treat and only release it to his mouth when he has all four feet on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 Here's an example of what you can do if you've taught your dogs their names.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 Splash down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Kiko down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 Kiko sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 Splash sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 Now if you have a dog that guards food, you don't want to feed your dogs all together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 Have them on leash first far enough apart that they can't go after each other if a treat drops or if they suddenly don't want the other dog in their face while they're getting a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 This could be potentially disastrous if your dog doesn't like other dogs in their face while they're eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 An exercise you can do for that is having your dog on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 Kiko actually doesn't like other dogs near her while she's eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 So an exercise for that would be having her on leash so that she can't reach Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 And as Tug gets a treat, yes, she gets a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 So she's learning that when he gets a treat, she also gets a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 This is basic, classical conditioning to change your dog's emotional response to other dogs being around while they're working for food from being a punishing experience to being a reinforcing one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 When you feed this one a treat, you want to feed this one a treat too so that this dog's learning not to put their face into Kiko's face when Kiko gets a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 If you're unsure how your dogs will be around food together, always start off with both dogs on leash held by a separate handler so they can't reach each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 Some dogs might need to be over 10 feet away from each other to begin with until they've learned they do not have to compete for the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 These exercises are great for teaching a pack of dogs there's no need to bicker or argue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=535&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 Their handler is in charge of who gets what and they don't need to take matters into their own hands, decreasing all the dog's stress levels.
