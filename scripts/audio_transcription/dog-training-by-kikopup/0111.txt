https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone in this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=2.0s	2.0	 I'm going to do a demo with my puppy who's learning to do a down on just a verbal cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 His name is cloud and we got to the point where he's offering a down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=12.3s	12.3	 So I'm going to start to do a training session where we do quick repetitions of a down where I'm not changing my location
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 so in other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 in other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=23.2s	23.2	 Situations when I'm training I'm moving around and making it slightly different all the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 But in this situation when adding a verbal cue, I'm going to let the environment help with cueing the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=35.1s	35.1	 So he might be offering a whole bunch of different behaviors, but I'm going to start to ask for a down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=41.3s	41.3	 Repetitively, so I'm going to come over here. I don't think you're oh, he's already laying down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 He can read my mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=47.7s	47.7	 So I'm going to say down and then I'm going to lure him into the down position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=52.3s	52.3	 Mark and reinforce and then I'm going to cue him to get up free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 and then throw a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Then cue him to down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=62.9s	62.9	 Good whoops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 Treat throw wasn't very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=71.1s	71.1	 Great, so I'm giving him random amounts of treats for staying down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=75.9s	75.9	 Great, and then cueing him to get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 So when he gets up free he gets one treat and when he goes down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=83.5s	83.5	 He gets multiple treats and the same you could do for a sit or a stand stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 The problem with just giving one treat is sometimes if you then want the dog to stay down for a longer period of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 They don't get that one treat and it's suddenly a different picture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 Or they they just get the one treat and then they pop up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 I thought I would zoom in a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 So the technique I was using was that I say the cue down and then if he didn't do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=111.4s	111.4	 I would lure him into the position mark and reinforce another way you can do it is repeat the behavior down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=118.3s	118.3	 Release the dog free and then feed the treat and then see how fast the dog goes back into the down position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=125.3s	125.3	 mark and feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 Free get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=128.9s	128.9	 So he most likely is going to go into the down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=131.6s	131.6	 Within a second and that's a great time to add a verbal cue now you can free repeat the behavior multiple times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 And see how fast he goes into the down position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=142.2s	142.2	 Free and what I usually suggest is that if you keep seeing the dog not immediately go into the down position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=149.1s	149.1	 Two to three times when you're doing about five to ten repetitions free then don't add the verbal cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 Good free, but I really like to use luring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=161.2s	161.2	 So if I sit down and he suddenly sat I would just lure him into the down position and then feed him a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 Because he didn't know what to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=169.9s	169.9	 Free now you might not want to do that yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 But that's that's how I train so that there's a high rate of reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=176.7s	176.7	 The dog is trying he doesn't know what we want. So I reinforce the dog trying to figure it out and then give hints
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=185.6s	185.6	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=187.6s	187.6	 You can also practice with your dog at your left or right side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=194.5s	194.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y84AlAP2Ovk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=112&pp=iAQB&t=195.9s	195.9	 Thank you so much for watching if you'd like to support my work
