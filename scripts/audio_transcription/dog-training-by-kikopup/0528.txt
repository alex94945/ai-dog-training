https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 The default leave it is one of the first exercises to do with your new puppy or rescue dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 This is Max's first lesson. He is a six month old Chihuahua.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 This is a default leave it where the dog learns never to do what this dog is doing right now, which is mugging the hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 They're trying to get the treats out of the hand. If they're constantly thinking about the food, they're not going to learn as quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 So instead of going no no bad dog or going like this or going wrong, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 I'm going to let the dog try and do what they want to do. So let the dog scratch you. Let the dog bite your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 Obviously not if it's really painful, but the millisecond the dog backs away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 they get a click and treat so they get what they want by not trying to get what they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 Like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 And for staying back, you don't want to build a behavior chain of mug the hand and then back away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 Here is the first lesson of Bogart. He is a rescued 12 week old golden mix.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 So right now he's like trying to get the treats out with his paws and his mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 And the millisecond that he decides not to try it, like he backs away and thinks, hmm, that's not working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 That's when I'm going to click. He's pretty smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 Good boy. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 So when you have food, the best thing you can do is just lay down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 That's that's the behavior that works. Not just coming and bothering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 So treats are happening for for not thinking about the food in my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 Even some eye contact might be nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 So I'm asking for eye contact instead of staring at or looking at my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 So the way to get treats is stare at my eyes, not at the food or think about the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 So I'm going to wait Max out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 Hopefully Max will think to look up at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 And now I'm going to put my hand somewhere else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 So make it a different situation. The food is now here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 Max is going to try and get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 You know, again, so dogs don't generalize well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 New situation means try everything again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 So do this a couple of times, you know, do a couple of sessions of this before they actually get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 So I'm going to put my hand somewhere else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 So I'm going to put my hand somewhere else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 So I'm going to put my hand somewhere else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 So do this a couple of times, you know, do a couple of sessions of this before they actually get what it means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 Use this same exercise for your bait bag or treat containers that you use to train with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 He's already not bothering the bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 So I'm going to click that because I like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 But basically a normal dog will, a much slower dog, will try to get his nose in here and get the treats out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 Which is annoying because you're standing there and they keep trying to get the treats out, especially when he's taller.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Or if you're sitting on the ground, he's going to keep trying to get the treats out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 So you want to teach him a default, leave it, leave the bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 If you try to get treats out, nothing will happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=204.0s	204.0	 So instead of going no or closing, you know, not letting him gain access to it, you're teaching him that it doesn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 So why would you bother?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 If you keep saying no or some people will turn around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 the dog will think as soon as she's distracted I can get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 If your dog becomes very aroused by food or has a hard mouth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 begin this exercise with something in your hand that he has low interest in, like a carrot or a piece of kibble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 Thanks for watching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CCJxF-9U4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=529&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 Don't forget to subscribe if you want to see more free training videos.
