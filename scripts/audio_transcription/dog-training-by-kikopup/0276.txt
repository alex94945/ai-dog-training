https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, in my last video I talked briefly about how you can use previously trained cues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=6.1s	6.1	 to interrupt undesirable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=8.7s	8.7	 Today I want to talk about training a cue that is great for dogs who have no sense of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=13.1s	13.1	 personal space or can seem a little bit pushy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 Now if you were to walk into a dog to get them to move away from you, that is for most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 dogs considered very intimidating and can be challenging, frightening, scary or even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=27.7s	27.7	 frustrating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=28.7s	28.7	 So in this tutorial I'm going to show you how you can teach your dog that you walking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 towards them to get them to move is simply a cue to back up and it's not some sort of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=38.7s	38.7	 intimidation game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=40.3s	40.3	 So say for example you want to get through a doorway and your dog's not moving, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 just walk into them and it's a cue for them to back out of your way as you get through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=49.5s	49.5	 the door with your groceries without them starting to think that you're trying to play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=53.2s	53.2	 some type of intimidation game with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 Are you ready Boo Boo?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=57.9s	57.9	 This is also a really good technique say for example if you have a dog that when you walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 into them they start to climb up you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 If you've not had a dog do this to you, you probably don't know what I'm talking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=71.2s	71.2	 but some dogs as you approach them and they don't back up they'll then start to climb
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=76.4s	76.4	 up your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 So this is a great technique for dogs like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=81.6s	81.6	 Without prior training most dogs find a direct approach where you move into their space punishing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=87.3s	87.3	 and intimidating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 So for me it's a really important idea to work on this behavior so that when you move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=93.6s	93.6	 into your dog's space it's simply a cue for them to back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 So it's actually really easy to train your dog the cue of you moving into their space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 to be the cue to back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 You just need to have a treat in your hand, put it against your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 If your dog sits lure them up like this and then you just move towards them and click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=115.9s	115.9	 a stutter step backwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 Now if you have an extremely loud clicker don't click near your dog's ears you can use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=122.1s	122.1	 a marker word like yes when you see a paw movement in the opposite direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 It doesn't matter if they go a little bit skew but what you're looking for is the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=131.1s	131.1	 is moving away from you without climbing up you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 So I've got my treat down low at the head area and I'm going to move it into my dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=143.5s	143.5	 If your dog is very sensitive you can start with this exercise where you're not doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 a direct approach but you're moving into your dog from the side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=154.4s	154.4	 Now what you want to look out for is that the dog isn't putting his ears back as you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=159.9s	159.9	 move into your dog or tucking their tail or arching their back or looking submissive licking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 their lips and blinking their eyes at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=168.3s	168.3	 So you want to see a confident dog that's looking at you with soft eyes, perky ears
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=173.5s	173.5	 and a relaxed tail or a wagging tail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 Once the dog is backing up when you take a step into them you can start to put the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 a little bit further away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 So you move the treat back a little bit click and then put the treat even further down for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=189.1s	189.1	 the dog to eat off the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=194.3s	194.3	 So I have my treat here I'm going to walk into my dog, click and then put the food down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=198.4s	198.4	 there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=199.4s	199.4	 You can also click and reinforce for your dog staying back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 Now it depends on your dog how far away you want them to move when you step into them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 I suggest if you have a dog that's really finding your approach intimidating that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=219.3s	219.3	 do a couple of training sessions before just walking into your dog without a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=224.1s	224.1	 Now you're going to take a step into your dog without a treat in your hand but you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=227.1s	227.1	 have your hand in the same area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=228.4s	228.4	 So you take a little step into your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 It doesn't matter if they sit you can get them to stand up again by putting the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=235.3s	235.3	 down on the ground like that or to the side so they have to get up to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 It's okay if they sit or lay down but it can make the training a little bit confusing because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=245.1s	245.1	 you might end up that every time you take a step towards your dog they sit then if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=248.9s	248.9	 trying to get through a doorway they might just sit in front of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=252.1s	252.1	 Ready?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=255.2s	255.2	 I'm going to take a step towards her, click and then throw the treat down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=261.3s	261.3	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=262.3s	262.3	 And now I'm just going to step towards her with my hands behind my back so she starts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 to understand the concept that it's me moving towards her and not the treat moving towards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 her that means back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=271.5s	271.5	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=272.5s	272.5	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=273.5s	273.5	 Then if you want to have your dog back up further I suggest bringing back your treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=279.6s	279.6	 lower to get more distance to the backing up behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=283.8s	283.8	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=285.1s	285.1	 You can also talk to your dog in a happy voice if you think that they're feeling a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=288.9s	288.9	 bit intimidated so you can go wee hoo hoo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=292.5s	292.5	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=298.1s	298.1	 in front of you while you're watching TV so you can cue the dog back up and then throw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=303.0s	303.0	 the treat back there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=314.2s	314.2	 You simply need to say the cue before you move towards your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=318.3s	318.3	 I with my own dogs use the cue back up but a great cue to use for guests is the noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=324.1s	324.1	 of a truck reversing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=330.0s	330.0	 know the trainer who came up with this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=333.7s	333.7	 But the great thing about the noise of a truck reversing is you can tell your guests to say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=339.8s	339.8	 that noise if they want your dog to reverse and they won't be able to say it in an intimidating

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 When playing this game you can also teach your dog a cue for coming towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyVkZrlcVSA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=277&pp=iAQB&t=350.5s	350.5	 I call it come forwards but you could call it come here.
