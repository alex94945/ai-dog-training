https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 there are some dogs that sail through puppyhood, adolescence and adulthood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=10.3s	10.3	 easily and the training goes really well and you have this amazing dog that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 everyone says, oh wow your dog's so well trained. But then there are some dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 that really struggle with adolescence and also start to develop different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 interests and desires during that period and that can get in the way of your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=31.2s	31.2	 training. So for example, a little example is my little terrier Tug. When I first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 got him he, well he actually had the issue that he didn't like, he had
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 separation anxiety so he really enjoyed being really close to me and he was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=46.9s	46.9	 socially anxious. So when I would go on walks he chose to walk next to me and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=51.6s	51.6	 even though I highly reinforced it, it wasn't really the same picture as him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 choosing me over things that he wanted to do because he, there were very little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=62.5s	62.5	 things that he wanted to do. So when he went into adolescence and I had built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=67.1s	67.1	 his confidence in training, what started to happen is he started to pull on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=71.2s	71.2	 because no longer was I the only thing that he wanted to be around and and this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 training was the only thing he wanted to do. He wanted to mark, he wanted to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=81.6s	81.6	 investigate, he wanted to see stuff in the world and he was very interested and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 excited about this new world and his new confidence so he started pulling on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 So it was like I suddenly had an untrained dog. So this can often happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 when the dog hits adolescence. It seems like all your training has gone out the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=103.6s	103.6	 window and that's just simply because before you, for a lot of puppies, you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=111.2s	111.2	 trumping everything in the environment. You are the most reinforcing thing to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=115.3s	115.3	 around and the treats are the most reinforcing thing to be around so the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=119.1s	119.1	 proofing that you've done hasn't really been the same as now when they're having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 these new interests. So it's just a matter of starting to proof or train the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=130.6s	130.6	 dog that to do the same behaviors even though there are these other interests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=135.4s	135.4	 in their life and that's a new concept for them. Another thing that happens is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=141.6s	141.6	 when you're a little two-year-old baby and you see someone with a red umbrella
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=146.4s	146.4	 or you meet your aunt for a week and then when you're you know like eight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=153.9s	153.9	 years old or ten years old someone asks you hey do you remember that umbrella or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=158.6s	158.6	 remember the aunt and you say I don't I don't remember at all and that's because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=163.1s	163.1	 what happens is the brain throws out some neural connections so not only is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 the dog have a completely different body especially if they're a large breed

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=180.5s	180.5	 this new big body that grew in just a matter of months but their brain is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 different they have different hormones in their body going around and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 might not remember the training that you did so and they have different things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=199.4s	199.4	 that they find reinforcing so there it's like you have a different dog on your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 hands than you did when you had a little puppy. Training and living with an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 adolescent dog can be overwhelming and frustrating for everybody sometimes you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=213.8s	213.8	 might even feel like it was a bad idea to get a dog in the first place everybody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=218.3s	218.3	 has that feeling so what is necessary is a little bit more work and management
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 during the adolescent period so also keep in mind the animal has only been on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=231.7s	231.7	 this planet a few months so expecting this robotic obedience from an animal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=237.1s	237.1	 when we don't even expect that sort of behavior from human beings at that age
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=242.9s	242.9	 you have to keep that in mind so here are four things that I suggest working on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=247.6s	247.6	 when your dog is in their adolescence. One, I suggest that you retrain all the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=253.5s	253.5	 basics all those foundation behaviors and use a one-to-one ratio of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=257.9s	257.9	 reinforcement and really reduce criteria so for example go back to how you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=263.3s	263.3	 originally trained leave it, loose leash walking, the recall, all those behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=269.6s	269.6	 that are important to you and if you do like sit or down stay and things like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=274.8s	274.8	 that you start working on those you could even work on luring the behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=279.9s	279.9	 so if you had like a five month old puppy there and it's a great day in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=283.8s	283.8	 their body is a completely different size than when they just two months ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=288.8s	288.8	 when they were tiny so their whole body has got to learn how to sit and down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 again with this new huge body that they're in it's like they've been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=299.1s	299.1	 transplanted into a giant's body so you can go back to luring sit down stand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=305.2s	305.2	 and or any behaviors that you want because it's almost a different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=310.0s	310.0	 behavior to the dog because they're learning to manipulate this enormous

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=321.5s	321.5	 you were proofing with a puppy if they like being around you more than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=326.4s	326.4	 everything else then perhaps you know if you were using the distraction of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=330.6s	330.6	 people and dogs they weren't that interested in going to see those people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 so it wasn't really the same proofing games as when they in this new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=342.1s	342.1	 environment when they're having different interests and finding

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=355.7s	355.7	 by that I mean for example working on a sit and a down stay you start adding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kvwI_DmHU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 distractions that they really would like to interact with so they're staying even
