https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi guys, I've been getting a lot of requests lately on how I train Splasher dancing trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=5.1s	5.1	 And so I thought I'd make a video tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 It was about eight years ago that I was in Spain doing some seminars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=11.5s	11.5	 And I also got to hang out with some amazing trainers one of them being Julia Fassi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=16.9s	16.9	 And she has this amazing trick that she trained her dog Nenna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=20.5s	20.5	 Where she sits down on the ground and her dog backs around her standing up multiple times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 And I was just so blown away by how cool that trick was that I wanted to train Splash the same trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 But I added a little twist by getting her to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=34.9s	34.9	 Side-step around me standing up and I would dance in a circle in the middle just to make it a little bit different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=40.6s	40.6	 But the credit really goes to Julia Fassi on this amazing trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=44.4s	44.4	 Not all dogs were built to be able to stand up on their back legs for example my Chihuahua and my Terrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=49.7s	49.7	 So it's a good idea to get the advice from a physical therapist to see if this is an okay trick for your dog to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=55.5s	55.5	 It's also a really good idea to practice this trick always on a non-slip surface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 Step one teach foundation behaviors. I suggest teaching your dog to stand up and the footwork separately before adding them together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=71.9s	71.9	 At first you can teach a supported stand where the dogs resting their front paws on your arm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 Standing up is not a trick for puppies instead you can work on the footwork and also teaching your puppy to sit pretty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=86.3s	86.3	 Make sure your dogs warmed up for example walking around for four minutes on leash before doing short mini sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 Don't worry if it doesn't look very pretty at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 I suggest clicking the moment your dog stands up and then feeding your dog with all four feet on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=102.9s	102.9	 If your dog puts his front feet down on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 He's giving you information that it's either too hard for him or he's tired
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=109.9s	109.9	 So listen to your dog and don't tell him he's wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=113.1s	113.1	 Simply see if he'll follow the lure up into the air or give him a break and try again later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 Now for the footwork. I suggest working on backing up turning at your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=124.6s	124.6	 backward circles around you and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=127.2s	127.2	 Side-stepping as a first step before asking your dog to do similar behaviors while standing on the back legs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=134.1s	134.1	 If you've added cues to the footwork it can help your dog understand what to do when he's standing up and you're luring him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=153.7s	153.7	 Step two use luring or targeting to get a full circle. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=158.4s	158.4	 Suggest refreshing the footwork before seeing if your dog can do the movement standing up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 It's a good idea to train this trick in both directions so your dog's muscles are equally built
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=188.4s	188.4	 This is how I originally train splash to turn even though I was standing still or turning in the other direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=197.6s	197.6	 However in my older age, I think I would use a target stick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=201.6s	201.6	 So I wouldn't have to bend over backwards a target stick basically extends your arm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 Step three adding a verbal cue and removing the lure or target
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=331&pp=iAQB&t=217.5s	217.5	 For me, yes
