https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone and happy new year! I'd love to introduce you to the latest member of the Kikopup dog pack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 This little guy is a terrier mix. He's about nine weeks old. I got him about a week ago and immediately I knew his name was Cloud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 He's a terrier mix. He might be a beaver terrier mixed with some other terrier. I might do an embark test and see exactly what he is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 But what exact percentages he is. But he really loves playing with toys which is super fun and he also likes food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 So I thought I'd talk to you a little bit about the first week of having this little guy in my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 Of course because I have so many dogs the priority for me is the happiness and reduced stress of all the dogs in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 So exercises that we worked on. Taking turns, taking treats, being comfortable, eating around each other and eating chews which I worked on last night where everyone learns to eat their chews in their own area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 And because I've already trained my other dogs before adding another dog all these basics I'm just mainly focusing on the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 So it's a good idea if you're thinking of getting a puppy and you have one dog to work on skills of waiting their turn for things and teaching them those concepts before you add the dog so you don't have to train two dogs at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 That makes it really that really reduces the stress in everybody's life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 My other dogs are trained to be okay behind the door of the training room or waiting their turn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 But because this is a new pup it's easier for them to be behind the door so I can concentrate and work on training this guy one on one and talking to you guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 Another thing that I did that you probably have seen in a couple of my videos is worked on building the reinforcement value of playing with toys immediately as I get my puppy so they don't start thinking whatever they play with first is extremely exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 Like the edges of carpets or your shoelaces or your shoes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 So my dad he actually was sitting at the table and my little guy played with my dad's shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 And then I said try bringing a different pair of shoes and tuck the shoelaces in and he completely didn't recognize them as the same thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 So a good idea is if the dog starts to show an interest in something like the corners of a small rug just put it away for a couple of weeks if the dog has become really interested in that thing and then build the value of these toys to play with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 So you can see he really enjoys these toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 Another thing that we did was just the basics of being in a group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 I don't remember if I mentioned it because I'm a little distracted with this guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 But so we worked on taking turns taking treats and settling while the other dogs work do their training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 So I have a little crate for him that he can go in and I can feed him treats for watching the other dogs do stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 So we've done that a lot and he's really good at separation training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 So I'll make a video on separation training tips but very quickly he was immediately very comfortable being left alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 So anytime that he felt like taking a nap and he was looking for a place to sleep and like settled in his little dog bed then I would calmly pick him up put him into his crate in the cushy bed and sit next to the crate until he fell asleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 And if he woke up and whined I would just take him out and what that did and take him to the bathroom and what that did is reinforce him for going to the crate to sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 But a lot of people would worry that if the dog whines and you let them out they will pop up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 They will learn to always got stuck in his teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 They will learn to whine to get out of the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 But if you're training your dog to like being in there they're not going to whine anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 So I just let them out when they whine or if I hear them waking that's even better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 So if you hear them rousing just let the puppy out to go to the bathroom before he thinks to whine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 So there he was chewing on the curtain and I recall can you see the curtain?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 Oh yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 And I recalled him but the curtain was stuck in his teeth so I just unhooked his teeth from the curtain and didn't make a big deal about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 Where a lot of people would be like oh you punished him for going and messing with the curtain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 If your dog thinks hands on them, manipulating them is punishing and aversive you need to work on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 So handling games and games to build your dog's trust and connection with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 And then if something happens say they get something stuck in their mouth like yesterday Bliss chewed on some wood and got some wood stuck between his teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 I could open his mouth and you know wrench that piece of wood out from between his teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=304.0s	304.0	 And he didn't think it was some sort of intimidation game where without any prior husbandry or handling training or grooming training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 The dogs can think you're doing something intimidating to them and it can it can be punishing and aversive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 So okay then so we worked on building interest in toys and also when I first got him I noticed that he was being free fed which was amazing because he was very comfortable around food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=334.0s	334.0	 He doesn't show any signs of resource guarding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 Ow! You've got my finger in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 He doesn't show any signs of resource guarding which is really lovely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 But I noticed when I first got him he was excited about the new treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=349.0s	349.0	 But then soon after eating a couple of them after one training session then for the next day the training sessions I would try to use food and he would just kind of put it in his mouth and then just toss it and play with it like it was a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 So instead of trying to train anything what I did was feed him his meals and then times in between meals I would work on the taking turns taking treats just handing out treats to everybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 And then once he got interested in taking treats and a few days had gone by where he was having scheduled meals and I like to feed a nice big meal in the morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 So I would do the training around midday and just work on something very very simple like a recall for his name for a treat or running towards me a recall or an attention noise for a treat or moving towards me or feeding taking turns taking treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 And then he started to show more interest in working for food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=413.0s	413.0	 So a lot of people think oh no my dog's not food motivated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 It's changeable and what you have now can change so don't take for granted what you do have now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=422.0s	422.0	 If you see it starting to change you need to change your training plan so you might need to try different types of treats or you might have to reassess that you might be over feeding your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=432.0s	432.0	 Sometimes if you overfeed a puppy this is just my opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=436.0s	436.0	 I don't know if it's scientifically correct but it's something I've observed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=440.0s	440.0	 If a dog has been overfed they might not want to train for the next few days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 Some dogs because they've had a lot to eat and they're just not interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 Also if you really like cereal and you eat cereal every day for every meal it can get boring and it might be months for some dogs to get bored of cereal but then the day happens that they get bored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=466.0s	466.0	 So Bliss started my six month old border collie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=471.0s	471.0	 He started to get a little bored of the treats and we switched it up and he's amazing again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=477.0s	477.0	 So it wasn't just that he was becoming disinterested in training he was just not that interested in the treats that we had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=485.0s	485.0	 Importantly right at the beginning when you get your pup around 8 to 12 weeks old they chew a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 They don't know to not chew on stuff so it's important to watch them 100% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=499.0s	499.0	 Then what I find with my own puppies is they get much better at not chewing on everything with training and sometimes that can happen as quickly as in a week so that they're focused on just chewing on their own things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=513.0s	513.0	 But you saw this little guy he was going after the curtains so I really have to watch him to make sure that I'm reinforcing the getting him rehearsing chewing on the appropriate items and enjoying those and not finding the other stuff of interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=529.0s	529.0	 Because I'm not creating a reinforcement history by quickly interrupting that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=535.0s	535.0	 But sometimes what can happen is that you then think that the dog is trained but what happens is when the adult teeth grow in around five or six months of age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=547.0s	547.0	 Once the back molars have grown in they start to want to chew on things as those molars are setting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=554.0s	554.0	 So I'm not sure exactly what the sensation is for the dog but they start to look for things to chew at things that are hard so they might go for your skirting boards or door frames or anything like table legs things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=572.0s	572.0	 And they might never have chewed on wood or table legs before and then around five or six months depending on the dog's size because dogs grow their teeth at different times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=583.0s	583.0	 Depending on their size but for Border Collies I always find it around five months like just after they've turned five months it starts to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=591.0s	591.0	 So for Bliss it started just before I got this other puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=598.0s	598.0	 So basically I'm having to watch two baby puppy and another adolescent and making sure they don't chew on stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=610.0s	610.0	 So I used to leave Bliss alone in the bedroom with the other dogs loose all my six dogs loose in the bedroom and that was great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=618.0s	618.0	 But now that he's chewing on stuff I've gone back to leaving him in a crate if I leave for an hour during a time that he might sleep or leaving him in a pen or a room that I know is safe that he's not going to chew on stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=633.0s	633.0	 So that's extremely important. You can also use something like bitter apple and rub it on the skirting boards and things that the dog might think to chew on and then leave out things like a really nice bully stick or something like that or a bone to chew on so that they have something to chew on when they need to because they do need to chew on something especially when the teeth are coming in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=660.0s	660.0	 So Cloud here can become very excitable and want to play and run around. You saw him going after the curtain biting my finger right now. So now wouldn't be a very good time to work on something very calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=672.0s	672.0	 If your dog your little pup was in a sleepy calm mood that would be the perfect time to work on training a settle or stationary behavior like a down or going and standing on a platform with two feet or four feet where you want the dog to be still and then when they're in a mood like this where they're a little bit excitable then you and perhaps they're not interested that much in food then you would work on moving tricks with food but you might if your dog is very excited you might want to work on moving tricks with food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=702.0s	702.0	 If your dog is very excited by food you might just want to work on playing with toys at one of these moments and then only work with the food when your dog is calm so that you start to build that association of being calm and concentrating and not over excited when working with food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=718.0s	718.0	 However when he was not that interested in food I would wait for moments where he was like this and then work on recalls and attention noises and another thing I personally have worked on is things like leg weaving and teaching the dog to go around in a circle when they're feeling active to motivate them to move for the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=745.0s	745.0	 So I really like teaching the weaving and circling behaviors to puppies because it's a nice slow movement where they're learning to turn in a circle rather than spin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=758.0s	758.0	 If your puppy is spinning too fast when you lure them then what they can be doing is an unusual movement where it's much better if they're walking in a circle to the left and the right or around you or around your legs in a figure of eight as a nice fitness exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=775.0s	775.0	 Hey little one. Now we're going to do some training with some of his food that's in very small pieces and I've pre-measured it so that I don't overfeed him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=784.0s	784.0	 It's about 12 p.m. and I fed him around eight this morning a meal of a pretty similar size and I want to give him treats here while I'm talking to make sure he doesn't get frustrated with me holding treats out and not reinforcing him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=801.0s	801.0	 So we're going to work on going around this plant because it's a really nice game for him while he's feeling active and wanting to move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=813.0s	813.0	 So I'm not feeding him from my hands right now because he's in such an excitable mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=818.0s	818.0	 I don't want him to learn to take treats hard from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=821.0s	821.0	 So I'm just playing Hansel and Gretel go around the object or the cone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=827.0s	827.0	 So I have a video on how to teach this and at first I'm just feeding him to get him used to the concept of the treats keep happening in front of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=836.0s	836.0	 And then I'm going to start clicking his movement and feeding him a little bit further ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=841.0s	841.0	 So I have a couple of treats in my hand and I'm going to mark him moving towards the tree and then putting the treat down in front of him and trying to get him to go around that cone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=854.0s	854.0	 But you can also see that this is a great luring exercise because if I naturally lure him I have to be quite far away from him to prevent him from jumping and bouncing and trying to bite my hand to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=866.0s	866.0	 There I clicked him for being still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=871.0s	871.0	 Let's go around the other way just for fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=874.0s	874.0	 Confuse him a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=876.0s	876.0	 Not on purpose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=878.0s	878.0	 We won't go around the other way because it will confuse him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=881.0s	881.0	 It's better to work on one direction for a little bit of time until they get it and then go in the other direction unless it's a movement that's going to make them completely dizzy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=896.0s	896.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=899.0s	899.0	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=900.0s	900.0	 And you'll see his movement start to get more smooth and concentrated than the stutter start movement that started at the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=911.0s	911.0	 Okay, I've got to reload my hand with treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=915.0s	915.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=916.0s	916.0	 And give him one for waiting patiently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=918.0s	918.0	 And now I'm going to do the game again where I feed him a treat and then mark him moving towards my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=928.0s	928.0	 And you really want to make sure you're marking for walking or trotting or running towards your hand without jumping or biting in the air or doing some strange behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=940.0s	940.0	 He might be hopping or something, you know, like a little rabbit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=945.0s	945.0	 Okay, here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=949.0s	949.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=951.0s	951.0	 This is a much taller prop than I thought.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=956.0s	956.0	 It's a little hard to lean over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=959.0s	959.0	 There he got my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=961.0s	961.0	 So I need to be faster at moving my hand away and marking the moment he's moving towards it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=968.0s	968.0	 Otherwise, I'm just going to train him to bite at my hand instead of follow a treat with precision as a lure to train him something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=980.0s	980.0	 And it would help if this was lower for me so that it's not such an awkward movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=987.0s	987.0	 You want to make sure whatever your dog is going around, it's a little bit higher than their shoulder or they might just walk over it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=994.0s	994.0	 Okay, so we worked on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=997.0s	997.0	 That's as much as I want to work on that in one training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1001.0s	1001.0	 So now the bag is empty and I've got the rest of the remaining treats out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1006.0s	1006.0	 I think I'm going to work on some nose targeting, teaching him to touch my hand because most likely he might bite at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1015.0s	1015.0	 But of course, he touched it perfectly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1018.0s	1018.0	 So because there's treats on my hand and I'm holding them out, I'm going to mark that moment he goes to sniff my fingers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1024.0s	1024.0	 And I promise you I have not worked on this prior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1029.0s	1029.0	 I like to make a different signal than the luring gesture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1032.0s	1032.0	 So I lure like this or like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1034.0s	1034.0	 And then for targeting with little dogs, I do that and have two fingers that they touch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1041.0s	1041.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1043.0s	1043.0	 You can also, if you have a dog that's biting at your fingers, mark them moving towards your hand before they go to bite it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1052.0s	1052.0	 And there he had an open mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1054.0s	1054.0	 If you can see that as he approached my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1057.0s	1057.0	 So I've just make sure that it just doesn't happen multiple times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1062.0s	1062.0	 So if your dog's in an excitable mood during this exercise, like if I had done it while he was super excitable right after he'd gone a bit the curtain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1071.0s	1071.0	 then I might want to use something like a large target plate and rub some smelly thing in the middle that your dog wants to go to sniff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1080.0s	1080.0	 And they might be less likely to want to bite at the middle of a disc that smells good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1087.0s	1087.0	 So I've got a tiny bit of treats left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1090.0s	1090.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1091.0s	1091.0	 And I'm going to end there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1093.0s	1093.0	 As you noticed, I didn't add any verbal cue because I wasn't sure if he was going to touch my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1098.0s	1098.0	 So if I kept saying touch, touch, touch, and he's not touching my outstretched fingers, then the cue is not going to mean very much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1108.0s	1108.0	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1109.0s	1109.0	 So now I'm just going to feed him the rest that's in my hand like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1113.0s	1113.0	 And I like to teach dogs that once I fed them all those treats at the end of the training session,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1119.0s	1119.0	 I show them that there's no more and I say, all done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1122.0s	1122.0	 And he might not hear it right now, but he'll see that there's no more treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1126.0s	1126.0	 All done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1127.0s	1127.0	 And then I'll say, let's go out, go pee or go play with a toy or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1131.0s	1131.0	 And that creates an end to the training session for those times where you've trained your dog to offer behavior for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1138.0s	1138.0	 So there's no more treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1140.0s	1140.0	 And then I could say, you know, take him out to the toilet or just say, OK, go play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1145.0s	1145.0	 And then he could play with his toys again if he wanted to or get a drink of water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1150.0s	1150.0	 So you can always end a training session with dry treats by going, let's go get some water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1155.0s	1155.0	 And then they go drink some water and then go out to the bathroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1159.0s	1159.0	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1160.0s	1160.0	 Well, I hope you enjoyed this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1163.0s	1163.0	 I'm super excited and happy to introduce this little guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZJI-sBCTQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=118&pp=iAQB&t=1167.0s	1167.0	 If you want to support my work, don't forget to like, comment and subscribe to my channel.
