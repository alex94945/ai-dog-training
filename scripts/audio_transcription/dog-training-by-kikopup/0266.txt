https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everyone, today's topic is on submissive urination when greeting people. Now this can be a very frustrating behavior for owners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 but the most important thing you want to remember is to not act emotionally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=11.4s	11.4	 when this happens. You want to act very neutral and tell yourself that in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=15.9s	15.9	 you'll prevent it from happening and you will train your dog. But if it's already happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=20.1s	20.1	 there's nothing you can do about it and the worst thing you can do about it is act frustrated or angry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=25.4s	25.4	 because what can happen is it can make your dog more likely to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=29.3s	29.3	 submissively pee themselves the next time that they greet you or greet a person. So it feels frustrating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=35.8s	35.8	 but you have to learn to control your emotions and just think oh well next time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=40.6s	40.6	 I'll be more careful with my dog. All dogs are different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=44.1s	44.1	 but there are some specific stimuli that make dogs more likely to submissively urinate when greeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 So I'm going to go over some of those. One is a direct approach where you walk directly at your dog like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 direct eye contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 leaning over your dog like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=59.9s	59.9	 petting the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 using a just speaking in general some dogs will pee just at the sound of a voice but a high-pitched voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 or a very deep loud voice can tend to make dogs submissively urinate and most importantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=75.3s	75.3	 how excited the dog is and how much time has passed since the dog has seen that person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=80.4s	80.4	 Now I'm going to talk about things you can do to make your dog less likely to submissively urinate when you're greeting your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=87.3s	87.3	 The first thing is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=89.3s	89.3	 waiting till the dog calms down to initiate a greeting or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=94.1s	94.1	 physical contact with your dog and in the description it gives some ideas on what you can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=99.8s	99.8	 Now if when you are greeting your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=102.8s	102.8	 I suggest instead of a direct approach you can arc around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=107.1s	107.1	 towards your dog or you can invite your dog into your space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 So the dog is coming towards you or coming towards your guest rather than them approaching your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 The other thing that you can do is not do direct eye contact at your dog. As you approach your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 you can look to the left and the right and blink at your dog because that is telling your dog that you're not a threat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 The other thing that you can do is instead of leaning over your dog like this to pet your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=134.3s	134.3	 you can lean over from the side to pet your dog and this is going to make your dog less likely to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 submissively urinate when you pet or interact with them. If you have guests visiting your house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=145.6s	145.6	 you want to give your dog an opportunity to go to the bathroom just before the guest arrives and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=149.8s	149.8	 then you can have your dog on a leash and a harness or in a pen so your dog has time to calm down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 before the initial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 interaction with the guest. You can feed your dog's treats for settling on his mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=162.3s	162.3	 while the guest is talking to you and ignoring your dog and then when you do have your dog interact with the guest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=168.9s	168.9	 you don't have to make it all about being touched and being excited by the guest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=174.5s	174.5	 Instead you could ask your guest to ask the dog for his favorite behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 So perhaps your dog likes to sit. You could get the guest to ask your dog to sit and give your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=185.9s	185.9	 Another really great behavior for dogs and guests to work on is the touch cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 and I'll link a video in the description, but it's basically teaching your dog to touch your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=197.7s	197.7	 So when you say touch the dog goes and touches their nose to your hand and the great thing about this is for a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=204.5s	204.5	 who submissively pees themselves when being touched the dog is actually touching the guest rather than the guest touching the dog as the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=212.1s	212.1	 first interaction and that can make the dog less likely to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 start to make that connection that greeting a person is about peeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 but rather that greeting a person is just about touching each other and there's no need to pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=267&pp=iAQB&t=225.4s	225.4	 Both paws! I hope you enjoyed this video. Don't forget to subscribe to channel Kikopup to show your support.
