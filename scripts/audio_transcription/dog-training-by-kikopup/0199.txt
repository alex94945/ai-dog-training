https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=5.2s	5.2	 a hundred percent of your attention in your free time and you're adding a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=9.2s	9.2	 dog to your household and you're worried that the existing dog is going to feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 a little bit neglected, stressed, or perhaps feel like they're gonna have to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=18.9s	18.9	 compete for your attention. In this video I'm gonna give you some tips and ideas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=23.4s	23.4	 on what you can do to reduce the stress for your existing dog when adding a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=29.6s	29.6	 dog to your household. It's a good idea that your existing dog's life and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=34.1s	34.1	 routines don't change too drastically with the appearance of this new family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 member. Some things you can do are if there more than one of you in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=42.9s	42.9	 family, one of you can walk your existing dog or dogs as you train your new puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=48.8s	48.8	 so that you don't have to train two dogs at the same time and teach your your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=54.8s	54.8	 dog that you already have to share your attention in training games. So one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 you can walk the dogs and the other can do training sessions with the puppy. Then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=65.3s	65.3	 that gives you more time when all the dogs are together to just work on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 concept of taking treats and taking turns taking treats because if you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=75.5s	75.5	 trying to train your puppy other stuff then your adult dog, especially if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 only have one other dog, is gonna feel really left out because they're used to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 getting all of your attention and not having to share their treats with other

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=92.8s	92.8	 puppy or adult dog is begin teaching them to be inside a large pen or behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=98.9s	98.9	 a barrier so your other dog or dogs are having their normal life going on as it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=104.9s	104.9	 usually did. Maybe they like to lay on the couch in the evening and watch TV
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=108.7s	108.7	 with you and the new member is getting used to this setup because they've never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=114.3s	114.3	 been in your house before and they don't know that everyone likes to lay on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 couch and watch TV at night and your existing dogs can have their same habits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=122.9s	122.9	 that they've usually been doing and this new dog can learn to be in a pen or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 behind a barrier and get reinforced for settling on a mat or playing with his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 toys and by doing this you're going to greatly reduce the stress for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=138.7s	138.7	 existing dogs and also you're going to be teaching this other dog that they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=142.8s	142.8	 don't need your attention a hundred percent of the time and that that will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=147.2s	147.2	 really help in the future with sharing your attention with other dogs and also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=152.5s	152.5	 being able to be left alone or separated from you. So another thing that's also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=158.1s	158.1	 really important is working on separation training with your new puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=162.3s	162.3	 or adult dog and while working on this training you can actually be giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=167.2s	167.2	 the dogs you already have that one-on-one attention that they really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 need during this time. So I think it's extremely important that when you get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=177.5s	177.5	 new puppy or adult dog that you give your other dogs more attention than you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=182.4s	182.4	 usually would. So one thing you can do is what I did with my puppy is I would put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 my puppy in my office in a pen with his toys and his bed and his water bowl for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=195.7s	195.7	 some alone time, turn some music on, shut the door and then for a couple of hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 I would play with my other dogs or take them for a walk and give them their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=205.2s	205.2	 one-on-one attention while the puppy was put away. Then when I got home what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=210.6s	210.6	 could work on is teaching the dogs to share me. So one game I would play which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 I'll link at the end of this video is taking turns taking treats. So teaching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 the dogs to wait their turn for a treat. The other game that's really good is and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=230.4s	230.4	 I do it with all the puppies and adult dogs that I ever get. The first game they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=235.5s	235.5	 learn is to wait while the dogs you already have do a training session. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=241.8s	241.8	 the dogs that I already have could learn behaviors that they'd already worked on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=247.7s	247.7	 and that were really easy. So I'd ask them to do different behaviors and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=251.8s	251.8	 the new family member would learn to just settle on a bed and receive treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 for watching the training session. Now when you work on this first with your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=260.8s	260.8	 new puppy it's going to be an amazing skill for that puppy to have down the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=265.4s	265.4	 line because they're going to be less frustrated when you're when you're when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=270.1s	270.1	 you're when they have to share your attention and also during training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=275.2s	275.2	 Another thing you can train if your dogs really enjoy being pet by you for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=279.3s	279.3	 example in the evening is you can teach your dogs their names and then they can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=283.6s	283.6	 take turns getting petting from you. So you can call your dog by name I could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=288.1s	288.1	 say wish come here come say hi and then I pet wish and then I can say all done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=292.8s	292.8	 now it's time for splash splash come here and then I can pet splash and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=297.9s	297.9	 give her the cue that it's all done you could say all done or go to your bed or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=302.3s	302.3	 whatever it is and then give another dog a chance for some social interaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=308.4s	308.4	 and petting with you. It's really helpful if you have multiple dogs to be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=313.8s	313.8	 share petting. Sometimes dogs in my household if I'm petting one dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 another dog will come in and want petting and that's totally fine as long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=323.9s	323.9	 as the other the dogs that's getting petted doesn't mind you have two hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=328.8s	328.8	 you could pet two dogs at the same time but if you notice some sort of tendency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=333.4s	333.4	 for guarding you you could just make it more clear that one dog gets pet and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=339.6s	339.6	 then the other dog gets pet and the dog that's waiting for their turn can get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=343.7s	343.7	 treats for watching the other dog get pet. With my own dogs I like to make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=348.6s	348.6	 that the dogs that I've previously had get their proper walk without the new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=353.2s	353.2	 dog or puppy coming along with them at first because this can be very stressful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=358.3s	358.3	 because that dog probably doesn't know how to walk on a loose leash so they'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=361.9s	361.9	 be pulling all over the place and that can stress out a dog that's calmly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=365.9s	365.9	 walking and sniffing and knows the routine. So what I suggest is that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=371.2s	371.2	 adult dogs or the dogs you previously have go on their walk while the puppy is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=376.2s	376.2	 having their separation training games or someone else is staying home with the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=380.8s	380.8	 puppy and doing puppy training and then later in the day you can do a mini
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=385.9s	385.9	 walk together to get them used to seeing each other walking around and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 could just go at your house and they could sniff around a little bit and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=394.0s	394.0	 go back inside rather than a long walk where you have to keep stopping because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 the puppy is pulling or the puppy is trying to bite at the legs of your other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 dog. So basically if you're walking two dogs and one's a puppy and one's an
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=407.8s	407.8	 adult dog that's you know not used to having a puppy around it can be really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=412.5s	412.5	 stressful and annoying to see this creature acting completely unpredictable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=417.6s	417.6	 next to your adult dog or if you're walking off leash that this poor adult
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 dog is becoming the target of the puppy or perhaps if you got an adult dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=429.8s	429.8	 that your dog can't escape anywhere because you're out on a walk. So that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=436.2s	436.2	 brings up another point that it's a great idea that if you see the dogs that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=441.1s	441.1	 you already own wanting to escape the new family member that they can have a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=451.4s	451.4	 a pen and vice versa if you get a new dog and the dog you already have is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=458.6s	458.6	 obsessed or just can't leave that other dog alone that you give them time apart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=463.9s	463.9	 so that they don't learn to dislike each other. I really like to build on positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=471.1s	471.1	 experiences so I don't actually like to let it depends on the dogs but if I if a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=478.0s	478.0	 dog is a real unknown dog or I have a very sensitive dog I'm not just going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk2hG-JQmhY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=200&pp=iAQB&t=482.4s	482.4	 let them when they start to initiate play play for too long because what can
