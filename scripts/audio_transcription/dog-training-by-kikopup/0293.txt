https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=9.6s	9.6	 Wish looks at me to see what I'm going to ask for next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=14.6s	14.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 So I suggest when you have a dog and you're interested in training them in training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 that you teach them what you want them to do when you haven't asked them to do anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=25.8s	25.8	 yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=26.8s	26.8	 For me, I would just like my dog to stand calmly and pay attention to me instead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=32.1s	32.1	 just stare at the treats or start offering strange behaviors that they think might work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=38.4s	38.4	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=40.4s	40.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 So now I'm going to ask her for some behaviors like a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=46.4s	46.4	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=47.4s	47.4	 And then I'm going to release her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=50.4s	50.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=51.4s	51.4	 And then.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=52.4s	52.4	 Ask her to twirl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=53.4s	53.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 And now I'm going to wait and reinforce her for waiting to hear what I have to say next.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=68.4s	68.4	 So if you have a dog that offers behaviors at you like crazy, I suggest just working
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=72.9s	72.9	 on a stand in front of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=75.7s	75.7	 So get your dog in front of you and click and treat them for keeping their feet still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 and then ask for some eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 And if they don't know eye contact, you need to work on that first and then add it together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 so they're just standing and looking at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=92.5s	92.5	 You could have your dog sit and wait or down and wait as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 It all depends on what type of training that you're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=102.4s	102.4	 But I really encourage people that if they have a dog that when you have a pause in your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=108.4s	108.4	 training and the dog starts offering random behaviors that you really do teach them what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff59EjL2jWk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=294&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 you do want them to do when you're training and you haven't given them any cues yet.
