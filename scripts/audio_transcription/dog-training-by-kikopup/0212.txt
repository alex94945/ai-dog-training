https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 To set your dog up for success, you can train the greeting as a behavior in training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 rather than trying to train your dog in those real life situations where he's over excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=17.4s	17.4	 So during your training process, you might need to use management and prevention where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=22.4s	22.4	 you prevent your dog from jumping up on your guests or doing undesirable behaviors as you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 train your dog what you do want him to do when around guests and greeting people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=31.9s	31.9	 Are you ready, Wishy? So I like to add a cue to this behavior, a verbal cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=37.6s	37.6	 wish free, but dogs can learn situational cues but I like to give a release to the guest so if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 I don't want my dog to meet a certain guest, I can just not cue the behavior of going to say hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=50.2s	50.2	 Are you ready? So I'm gonna say go say hello which is gonna be my cue for saying hello to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=56.1s	56.1	 guests so I'm gonna say that cue go say hello and first I'm just gonna mark and reinforce my dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 for standing in front of me directly and not moving her feet so I'm clicking and feeding her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=70.2s	70.2	 for standing still like this. Go say hello. You can also choose to put the treat down in front of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=79.4s	79.4	 the person or yourself like this if your dog takes treats hard when your dog is a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 excited. Awesome. The next step is clicking and reinforcing your dog for making eye contact with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=93.3s	93.3	 you. Good. So basically you want your dog to station in front of the guest and look up at their face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=104.1s	104.1	 Awesome. Go say hello. Good. Good. Get it. Say hello. Awesome. If your dog keeps looking at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=125.8s	125.8	 the treats in your hand you can check out my video on how to train your dog to make eye contact with

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=138.7s	138.7	 position for dogs like Wish who at some point get a little bit overwhelmed with too much handling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=143.4s	143.4	 and too much social interaction and she can easily back away where if I ask her to sit for guests she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=149.4s	149.4	 might be less likely to be able to tell us that she's had enough by simply backing away. If you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=156.1s	156.1	 have a happy-go-lucky dog that's extremely comfortable with being handled you can use sitting as the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 to you you're gonna cue the dog to sit either with a visual or a verbal cue and then you're gonna see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=172.4s	172.4	 if the dog might offer sitting before you say sit or give the hand signal. So I'm gonna throw the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 treat or you could simply feed the dog and then walk away if you don't want to put treats down and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=182.9s	182.9	 say go say hello and then sit. Good. Now I'm gonna show you a video clip of my friend Sarah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=190.8s	190.8	 Surrit who's a professional dog trainer from Get Positive Dog Training who's training a large

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 If your dog is comfortable with handling you can add handling into the greeting behavior. So after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 you've cued your dog go say hello and your dog is stationed in front of you you can then start to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=240.8s	240.8	 handle your dog in the ways that guests might handle your dog but first starting off with very

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 Mark and feed. The side of the face. Good. If your dog is uncomfortable or gets excited and jumps up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=259.3s	259.3	 when people bend over your dog you can practice bending over. Good. And marking and reinforcing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=599.5s	599.5	 Then, when your dog is eating food again, you can practice the greeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=603.5s	603.5	 If the dog is too excited to eat food, he most likely is too excited to greet your guest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=611.5s	611.5	 Yes, what a good dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=613.5s	613.5	 What a good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=618.5s	618.5	 If your dog is too focused on you and the food that you're holding,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=621.5s	621.5	 you need to wait for the moment that the dog is looking at the guest to mark and feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=625.5s	625.5	 This is because if he just stares at you and the food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=629.5s	629.5	 he will not learn to not jump up when the food is out of the picture and he's staring straight at the guest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=635.5s	635.5	 Say hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=637.5s	637.5	 Hi, Hannah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=638.5s	638.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=640.5s	640.5	 Hi, Hannah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=641.5s	641.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=642.5s	642.5	 Hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=645.5s	645.5	 Hello, Hannah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=647.5s	647.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=650.5s	650.5	 It's important to understand that no matter what you train as your greeting behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=654.5s	654.5	 and no matter what your dog's personality is like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=656.5s	656.5	 that sometimes the greeting can go on for too long if the guest is very excited about seeing the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=662.5s	662.5	 So it's a good idea to give your dog a break from the guest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=665.5s	665.5	 ask your dog to come to you or say, let's go and move away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=668.5s	668.5	 and then see if your dog wants to go back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=670.5s	670.5	 And sometimes dogs don't want to go back because they realize only at a distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=674.5s	674.5	 that what was happening was a little overwhelming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=677.5s	677.5	 Also, guests, if they keep on going, they can make your dog too excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=681.5s	681.5	 or conversely make your dog disinterested in wanting to say hi to more guests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=686.5s	686.5	 because the guests are just being too overwhelming for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=689.5s	689.5	 So the best way to teach your dog to enjoy saying hello to guests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=693.5s	693.5	 is keeping the interaction short and giving the dog a break in between saying hello to guests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=699.5s	699.5	 If you cue your dog to say hi to someone and your dog refuses to say hi to them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=704.5s	704.5	 it's important to respect your dog's decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=706.5s	706.5	 Perhaps your dog isn't feeling very well that day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=709.5s	709.5	 and it's not really a good idea for someone to be petting a dog that doesn't want this social interaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=715.5s	715.5	 Hey, wishy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=716.5s	716.5	 If you have a dog that can become shy, fearful, or reactive when being handled by guests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=721.5s	721.5	 or greeting guests or even yourself, it's important to seek the help from a professional trainer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=727.5s	727.5	 that doesn't use any forms of physical or psychological intimidation to help you with the training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=732.5s	732.5	 because you might be raising criteria too quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=735.5s	735.5	 or not being able to read your dog's signs that he's uncomfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=739.5s	739.5	 or feeling conflicted with the greeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=741.5s	741.5	 And what you can be doing is actually teaching the dog to not enjoy greeting guests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=747.5s	747.5	 Thank you so much for watching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=749.5s	749.5	 I just want to give a quick shout out to one of my number one YouTube sponsors, Bella Fiori Logotos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQrefk0Wyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=213&pp=iAQB&t=756.5s	756.5	 Can you do both paws?
