https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=4.3s	4.3	 Yesterday's tip was about teaching your dog to down from the heel position on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=9.4s	9.4	 the move and today's tip is down on a recall or in other words down while the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 dog is running to you after you've called them. This can be a useful safety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=19.7s	19.7	 tip say for example your dog's running at you and then the car suddenly appears
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=23.7s	23.7	 out of nowhere and you want your dog to stop but it's also a fun way to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 your relationship with your dog and build clarity to the recall and the stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 behaviors. Are you ready? So it's a very simple game it's just a matter of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 practicing and using the environment to set the dog up for success so the mat is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 going to be the signal area of where the dog is going to lay down when you ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 them to down so it's going to be very obvious to the dog to not lay in front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=53.7s	53.7	 of you because without any visual cues if you've always worked on down in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=59.4s	59.4	 front of you and at your side when you say down the dog might want to get into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 that normal picture of where they usually down so they'll go to the area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 that you've trained down the most which is in front of you or at your side so if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 you start working on go to the mat and down that's going to be the new area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 where your dog's going to learn to down and it's going to make it so much easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 for the dog to understand the concept of you asking for the behavior when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 they're not near you. Hi there! So let's get started. I'm just going to get some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 more treats okay and I'm going to ask her to sit and take some steps away from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 her now this is something we need to work on anyway so it's a great way to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=101.6s	101.6	 proof your your stay in a sit position if you want to work on that or you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 have the dog stand or down or have a different mat for them to first sit on if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 you want to cheat and you don't want to work on your stay and you just want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=116.6s	116.6	 work on the down on the recall you can use a mat for the dog to wait on can you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=121.2s	121.2	 see that yeah okay so now I'm going to call her epic come down good come awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=131.7s	131.7	 and then we'll repeat that go to the mat and you can see it's much easier now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=137.7s	137.7	 that I have this platform for her to wait on I could make my I could make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 another video on what I really need to work with her on is teaching her to stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=147.2s	147.2	 in a sit position as I walk away which I've not worked on so that's why I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=151.2s	151.2	 utilizing that platform to break the steps up to make them easier okay and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=156.3s	156.3	 that's why she looks well trained if I take that mat away you'll see she can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=160.1s	160.1	 stay in the sit position I'll have to keep working on that while I also try to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 teach her a new behavior so if you notice your training sessions are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 turning into where you're working on multiple behaviors pick one and just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 work on that one so for me I'm gonna work on the down on the recall because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=175.9s	175.9	 that's what I feel like working on and I think she'll enjoy it and then I really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 need to make a mental note to work on this part of the behavior without the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 mat are you ready okay so I'm gonna call her epic come down good and then I'm

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=196.5s	196.5	 and I haven't gotten far away and I'm working in a room of no distraction so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=201.3s	201.3	 once she's gotten this behavior down I can practice without the mat in here and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=205.6s	205.6	 then I can go into the yard or some outdoor space that's less distracting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=211.2s	211.2	 than just general public areas and then work on this behavior using the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=215.9s	215.9	 platforms so that's gonna help her understand that it applies outside and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=220.4s	220.4	 then I can fade the platforms outside are you ready okay hold on I need more

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=240.3s	240.3	 already I usually like to tell them to do it so they understand it is a stay a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke-6iCZ7jqA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=79&pp=iAQB&t=245.8s	245.8	 behavior good job so now I'm gonna work on going back over here and her staying
