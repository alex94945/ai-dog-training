https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, this video is on tips for teaching your dog to be comfortable with veterinary procedures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 This is actually one of my Kikopup members videos that I posted to my members area on YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=12.4s	12.4	 Last year and I wanted to share this with you all so you could see an example of what the membership videos are like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 Basically, I go into more detail about certain things or I cover advanced topics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=24.8s	24.8	 Or I do a lot of problem-solving or show real-time training sessions with my with my own dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=30.9s	30.9	 So to become a member you can click the join button under any of my videos or on my YouTube channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=37.8s	37.8	 There's a join button you can click and it's around five dollars depending on what country you're living in five dollars a month
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 For the extra video in the members area sadly splash and my little chihuahua Kiko
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=51.2s	51.2	 Who's in that little black crate in the video? They're no longer with us splash died at 14 and Kiko died at 17
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=60.2s	60.2	 But I wanted to let you know that splash actually was a very difficult dog as a puppy and an adolescent dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 She was reactive to people she feared people and she feared vets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=72.9s	72.9	 I actually had to sedate her at six months for her to get her rabies shot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=79.2s	79.2	 Because I was really worried that she might actually bite the vet so she was human reactive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 She didn't like being touched by me or other people and she didn't like to be looked at and her worst fear was the vet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=92.3s	92.3	 So I worked a lot with her and in her old age
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=96.4s	96.4	 I could give her away to a vet and she would walk on a loose leash calmly and happily into the building and even have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=104.1s	104.1	 Radiation treatment and after 20 days in a row of going in for an hour and coming back out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 She still would go in on a lovely loose leash and it really made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=116.2s	116.2	 veterinary visits for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=118.3s	118.3	 during her whole life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=120.5s	120.5	 Sorry, I'm getting a little emotional made it so easy for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=123.9s	123.9	 So it's really really a good idea to work on this stuff and you know doing this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=129.9s	129.9	 I'm remembering that you know my little Chihuahua epic who's also starring in this video and my terrier tug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 I can do more of this. I need to work more on this because sometimes time goes by and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=144.1s	144.1	 And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=145.5s	145.5	 You know behaviors degrade so you have to brush up on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=148.7s	148.7	 So I hope this video gives you a little bit of a motivation to want to work on some handling and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=155.7s	155.7	 veterinary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 Procedures, so I hope you enjoy this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=159.8s	159.8	 There are many ways to teach grooming and handling procedures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 One of them is Chirag Patel's bucket game where the dog stares at a bucket of treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 And I'll link that in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=172.1s	172.1	 But instead of using a bucket you can have multiple treats in your hand and then have your dog stare at the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=178.7s	178.7	 That you're going to give them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 There's a little fly in here. That's what she's looking at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=183.2s	183.2	 So as you touch the dog they look at the treats yep, you can mark and then give your dog a treat slowly like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=191.9s	191.9	 Yep, good what I like to do and I have a video on grooming and handling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=197.7s	197.7	 On YouTube and I'll link that in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=200.4s	200.4	 But I like to do eye contact where the dog is looking at your eyes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 So as you reach and touch them they look up at your eyes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=207.8s	207.8	 Yep, and it's a little confusing to her because I just worked on staring at my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 But that's okay. She's smart. She'll figure it out. Yep. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=217.1s	217.1	 So I'm marking her for looking up at my eyes when a handling procedure is being done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=223.3s	223.3	 So that she can tell me yep that she's comfortable with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=226.7s	226.7	 And another way of doing this is reinforcing your dog for being in the neutral position good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=232.2s	232.2	 So you're going to mark the moment that the dog's head is in a very natural position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=238.1s	238.1	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=239.4s	239.4	 Facing forward like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=241.1s	241.1	 So I'm hiding my treat in a way that looks different from what I was doing earlier where I got her to stare at my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=247.2s	247.2	 And I'm making sure not to offer eye contact so good so it makes it easier for her to look forward like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 So with this where the dog is looking forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=258.5s	258.5	 It's when they stop looking forward and turn to look at you that tells you that something is too much for them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 Or they want to break good, so did you see how she looks forward like that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=270.1s	270.1	 Then with all these techniques good you want to make sure to move the treat slowly and feed the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=276.9s	276.9	 If they're laying down like that between their paws or make sure that you're feeding with the head in that neutral position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 Rather than they look forward and then whoops and then you this is treat is way too big for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 And then you feed with the head facing you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=293.9s	293.9	 Splash needs to have subq fluids given weekly in which an inch long needle is inserted into the skin and fluids are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=301.5s	301.5	 Administered there for the body to absorb so in between these sessions where she has an actual needle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=308.1s	308.1	 Poked into her back I can do games like this where I'm just reinforcing her for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=314.6s	314.6	 Trusting me doing stuff to her body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=320.3s	320.3	 Good so I'm gonna practice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 Laying my hand on her back good and reinforcing her for being in the neutral position good like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=331.6s	331.6	 This is helpful if you need both of your hands for the procedure good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=335.9s	335.9	 So I'm gonna lift her skin up and then stick the needle in like that good and instead of just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=343.3s	343.3	 Going over exactly what I will do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=346.1s	346.1	 A tip that I learned from Ken Ramirez is seminars is that you're going to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 unpredictable things to the dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=353.8s	353.8	 To the dog or the animal so that they don't know so that it isn't always a predictably painful or uncomfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=360.9s	360.9	 situation so grabbing her scruff like this and then you know finding a place to stick the needle and then poking if I keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=368.7s	368.7	 doing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=370.4s	370.4	 The dog starts to associate that with always being something negative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=375.1s	375.1	 So you can do a combination of things such as just laying your hand on your dog's back like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 Good splash actually does need to have subq fluids at the moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 But I just wanted to give you a tip for the vet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=388.9s	388.9	 if it's going to be something a little bit painful what you can do is bring extremely high value treats and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=395.9s	395.9	 feed as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=397.2s	397.2	 the pain happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=399.8s	399.8	 Now if you didn't do any training and you only did that that wouldn't have a very good result
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=405.6s	405.6	 because what could happen is your dog can start to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=409.3s	409.3	 Anticipate that when they get a treat something bad is going to happen and you can ruin all your training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=414.3s	414.3	 but if you have a dog like splash that you've done a lot of work with and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=419.4s	419.4	 You're going to have like a painful needle put in their back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=422.7s	422.7	 You can feed as it happens to help distract them away from the actual of some the actual pain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=429.1s	429.1	 That's happening to them. Another thing you can do is as they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=434.1s	434.1	 As the needle goes in you can also do a lot of other random
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=440.3s	440.3	 Touching that they're that they find really comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=443.1s	443.1	 Obviously if they don't like their feet being touched you can touch them on the shoulders like this good and then reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=449.6s	449.6	 And then another thing is practicing this in training sessions where you're doing all this weird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=455.7s	455.7	 extra touching while a procedure happens good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=460.4s	460.4	 awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=461.7s	461.7	 So as I said earlier you don't want to keep doing the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=466.4s	466.4	 Motion that's going to happen that that's going to predict the pain because if it is a painful thing for your dog or a discomfort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=473.8s	473.8	 It's going to start to predict the Punisher. So instead of always doing the same thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=479.9s	479.9	 Keep it different keep doing weird stuff until they trust everything every weird thing that you do to them. Hey splash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=487.9s	487.9	 Okay, so now we're actually gonna do the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=491.9s	491.9	 Sub-q and I am NOT an expert but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=495.5s	495.5	 Because she has to have it done so often we're doing it from home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=499.5s	499.5	 So sometimes I let her just lick a plate of peanut butter, but at the moment I'm going to have her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=507.2s	507.2	 I'm gonna reinforce her after the needles gone in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=511.0s	511.0	 So I need both hands to put it in and so she's gonna be a little bit patient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=515.1s	515.1	 So I'm gonna talk to her as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=517.6s	517.6	 as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=518.8s	518.8	 I'm doing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=519.9s	519.9	 I just have to make sure I do it correctly because as I said, I'm not the biggest expert
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=524.6s	524.6	 But one thing is needle safety. So I've got the cap on there and then good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=532.6s	532.6	 Give her a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=534.3s	534.3	 Find a nice spot on her back and then another thing is practicing a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=540.0s	540.0	 So I did a lot of practicing of what to do before the needle goes in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=547.0s	547.0	 Not before I do it but just randomly in the house so sitting on the couch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=552.2s	552.2	 I've been practicing how to make it a little tense with her skin so that the the needle goes straight in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=558.2s	558.2	 Now I'm nervous because I'm filming myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=561.2s	561.2	 So here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=563.2s	563.2	 Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=565.7s	565.7	 So I usually tell her good girl as it happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=571.0s	571.0	 Good girl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=572.6s	572.6	 So now the needle is in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=575.1s	575.1	 I'm gonna give her a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=577.7s	577.7	 I'm gonna let the fluid through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=580.8s	580.8	 And give her another treat you're doing so good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=584.7s	584.7	 Now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=586.4s	586.4	 I'm just going to squeeze the bag
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=589.3s	589.3	 of fluid into her body and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=592.1s	592.1	 That always good feels a little weird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=596.2s	596.2	 so my friend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=598.2s	598.2	 Who's a vet tech she gave me the tip to warm the fluid up nicely as I said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=605.4s	605.4	 What I did before was just give her a plate of food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=609.0s	609.0	 I gave her a dish with peanut butter and treats on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=612.7s	612.7	 But you can't just do that and and expect your dog to then like the procedure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=617.7s	617.7	 What it's what it's like is like if you're at a restaurant and a waiter comes by and pokes you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=624.1s	624.1	 If you keep going to that restaurant and they keep poking you it's not going to make you like the poking anymore while you're eating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=630.2s	630.2	 so you really have to make the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=633.3s	633.3	 What the procedure the predict predictor that something good is not going to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=638.3s	638.3	 But when you have trained your dog you can do things like give them a plate of food to to lick up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=646.0s	646.0	 And I'll put a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=647.9s	647.9	 Piece of video of her doing that or little treats to find in a snuffle mat during this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=654.4s	654.4	 Procedure of getting fluid put into your back. Well, this is gonna take a few minutes. So I'm gonna end the video here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=661.0s	661.0	 I just wanted to say thanks for watching and supporting my work and splash is doing amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=666.5s	666.5	 Actually, all my dogs are doing really well now if you had asked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=671.2s	671.2	 She's doing really good. She's getting fluids, but that's the reason that she's doing really well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=676.4s	676.4	 She's got a lot more energy since they found out about her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=681.5s	681.5	 High blood pressure so she's on high blood pressure medicine and it's almost like she has a second chance at life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=688.3s	688.3	 So she's really enjoying her final days here because she does actually have bladder cancer that we did some radiation and chemo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=697.0s	697.0	 But she had a really really bad reaction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=700.9s	700.9	 To the medicine so she almost died
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=704.4s	704.4	 So she it was like she came back from the dead and I didn't know that she was gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=710.4s	710.4	 Be around anymore for more than like a day or two at one point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUT90ojyc0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=62&pp=iAQB&t=714.1s	714.1	 But now she's just really enjoying life and part of the reason that she's enjoying life is that this is so easy for her
