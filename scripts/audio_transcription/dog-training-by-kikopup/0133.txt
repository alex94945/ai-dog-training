https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone! In this video I'm going to go over how you can teach your dog to hold an object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 Now there are many different ways to teach this, but the way that I'm going to show is involving choosing things that your dog most likely would like to have in their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 As you can see Epic is very interested in this cardboard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=22.5s	22.5	 If you have a little dog that doesn't really like playing with toys or you have a big dog that doesn't really like playing with toys, sometimes choosing the right object to work with initially is really going to help.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=36.5s	36.5	 I like to choose very thin objects. Also to teach the dog not to chomp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=42.5s	42.5	 These toys, sometimes as soon as the dog is holding it, especially if it has a squeaker in, they're going to want to chomp on it like that and they can still hold it even though they're moving their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 Where something very thin, if you're holding the other end and they start to open their mouth, it leaves their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 So I have these little note cards. You want to make sure that if they take an object that the edge isn't sharp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 So with my other dogs, they really liked holding onto these yogurt lids, but when Epic held onto the yogurt lid, she didn't like the little ridge on the end so I could cut that ridge off if I was going to use these yogurt lids.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 But I have different types of cardboard, really thin cardboard and the corrugated cardboard, and I thought she might like these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 So she did like those. Another idea is toilet paper or towel rolls to initially teach a dog to hold something if they're a little dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 Or you could have the whole towel roll and just squish it for a bigger dog and then paper towel rolled up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 This is actually what I taught Kiko originally to start holding because Kiko, my other little chihuahua who's in her bed over there, she's 16.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 But when she was a little pup, she didn't want to hold onto objects. Epic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 And so I used toilet paper roll, toilet paper rolled up at first and then moved on to paper towel and she really enjoyed holding onto that more than she did to toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 So experiment with different types of material and see what your dog might be interested in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 So I'm just going to play a little bit of a keep away game and the moment that she grabs onto whatever it is with her mouth, I'm going to mark and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 Now, if you have a dog that once you've given them a treat, they're no longer interested in what you have, putting the other thing in their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 I have a video on how to go over how to get the dog to want to play with you even though you have food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 And I'll put that after this video so you can check that out after this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 But basically what I'm doing is I'm marking her for interacting with the object with her mouth and eventually it's going to turn into tugging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 So once she's got a hold of it, I'm going to move it around and mark her for not opening and closing her mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 And because I've got slight pressure on it, if she does open her mouth like that, I can just pull it out of her mouth and I could give her a treat for that too, just so she doesn't get frustrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 But if I have slight pressure on the toy, like we're playing tug, I can mark her for holding without moving her teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 Ready? I can then start to add a cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 I can say, get it for like a faster, excited hold or I can say, take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 But she doesn't know that cue yet. So we're going to use get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 You ready? Get it. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 The next step, once you've taught your dog to hold on to the object and pull on it, is trying to let go while they're holding on to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 Good! And try to get two tugs like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 So what I'm hoping for is that it's in her mouth, I pull on it, and then it stays in her mouth for a millisecond before I pull on it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 And by pulling on it, it's going to make the dog less likely to just drop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 Because what can happen if you're not pulling on the object and you're just trying to mark and reinforce the dog for holding it for a longer duration,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 what can happen is they can pick the object up and then immediately drop it in anticipation of the treat, which a lot of people can struggle with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 Sometimes it's really easy to teach to free shape a holding behavior by just marking the dog for picking up an object or marking when the dog goes to fetch an object,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 marking the dog for waiting to give it to you. That's one way of teaching a dog to do a duration hold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 Another way is when the dogs fetch the object, that you just keep backing away and mark the dog for continuing to hold it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 as well as if you walk backwards and stop and then the dog walks towards you and you mark that millisecond that they're holding it in front of you stationary without dropping it yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 But this way is if you're really struggling. So I actually like to do it this way right from the start because I think it's fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=313.0s	313.0	 So I'm going to keep pulling on it and letting go like that. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 Good. And if the dog moves away from you holding it, you can still mark and reinforce because they have the object in their mouth and they're holding it, which is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=334.0s	334.0	 Hey, little one, even if you wanted to play, keep away with it. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=340.0s	340.0	 You can see that she really likes holding this in her mouth. But if I had started with something like metal object, she might not have wanted to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 This is a chopstick. I've made sure that there's no, what do you call it, splinters. Let's see if she might want to hold that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 So you always want to move the object away from them to get them interested in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 If you move it at their face, not very many dogs are going to open their mouth to let you put it in their mouth, except for Epic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=369.0s	369.0	 You can also play fetch with whatever it is. Get it. Bring Epic. Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=381.0s	381.0	 No? She said she didn't like the wood so much. Another one here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 Good. Another thing I could do is I have the chopsticks with the paper on them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 And she's much happier holding on to that, as you can see there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=412.0s	412.0	 So it's all a matter of making it as fun as possible to begin with and choosing surfaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 Choosing materials the dog really enjoys holding on to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=425.0s	425.0	 Good. That was a nice grip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=430.0s	430.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=432.0s	432.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=438.0s	438.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 Ready? Get it. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=461.0s	461.0	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=464.0s	464.0	 What's this? Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=469.0s	469.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=479.0s	479.0	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=483.0s	483.0	 That's a little hard because there are two chopsticks in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=487.0s	487.0	 Let's try with this thing. You want that thing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=496.0s	496.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=502.0s	502.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=511.0s	511.0	 Oh, she doesn't want to let go of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=518.0s	518.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=527.0s	527.0	 Good. That worked pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=533.0s	533.0	 Ready? Get it. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=544.0s	544.0	 She heard a noise outside. So I am going to give her a treat just to keep her in the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=551.0s	551.0	 And then I'm going to try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=554.0s	554.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=556.0s	556.0	 That actually seemed to stick to your tongue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=560.0s	560.0	 Ready? There's a dog barking outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=565.0s	565.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=567.0s	567.0	 I actually made her hold on for longer because she was holding it and thinking about the dog outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=573.0s	573.0	 Ready? Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=579.0s	579.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=581.0s	581.0	 So as you can see, this was way easier for her to hold and it's really, really thin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=585.0s	585.0	 And it's not too wide. So this specific little ring she wants to hold on to isn't that great?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=596.0s	596.0	 She's like, I love this. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=599.0s	599.0	 And now we're going to stop because I've given her quite a few treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=604.0s	604.0	 I've not given her all the treats, but she did so well with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=607.0s	607.0	 I'm not going to go back and ruin it with the other stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=609.0s	609.0	 But the next step would be just switching between objects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=614.0s	614.0	 And I'm going to build in the cue, take it, which was that nice delicate little hold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=620.0s	620.0	 So instead of get it, which means like go for it really aggressively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=624.0s	624.0	 Well, not too aggressive to play tug or to fetch an object very fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=631.0s	631.0	 I like to teach take it to mean take something gently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=634.0s	634.0	 Are you ready? So I can say take it and then have her take it like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=639.0s	639.0	 But we're going to end there because she was doing so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=643.0s	643.0	 It probably was also because she was a little distracted by the barking dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=647.0s	647.0	 But sometimes things just work out really nice. Hey, Popsie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=652.0s	652.0	 Take it. Once your dog is holding an object with duration, you can then use the cue drop to mean drop the object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=660.0s	660.0	 Instead of just clicking the dog for holding the object and then it drops out of their mouth when you click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=665.0s	665.0	 So you can also teach get it and drop along with this game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=670.0s	670.0	 So if you're asking your dog get it and then you're playing and then you say drop, mark and feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=677.0s	677.0	 You can also increase the duration that way and use the cue drop right from the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=682.0s	682.0	 But it really doesn't matter. The click in this situation ends the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=688.0s	688.0	 So if your dog is holding on to something, take it and you click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=692.0s	692.0	 They will drop the toy and you don't need to worry about that. Take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=697.0s	697.0	 But if you are worried about that, you can just use the cue drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=701.0s	701.0	 Drop and if the dog doesn't drop, you put a treat on the nose and then feed the dog the treat. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=707.0s	707.0	 If you have an adult dog or larger puppy or you're just worried about getting your fingers nipped,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=713.0s	713.0	 I suggest using a larger object such as a soft large frisbee or a soft plastic frisbee to do this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=721.0s	721.0	 Teaching drop and get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=724.0s	724.0	 First you have to get the dog interested in playing with the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=728.0s	728.0	 So this might take a little bit of time if you have treats out and your dog thinks that he's going to get treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=734.0s	734.0	 So you might want to wave the toy around. You might spend a few minutes getting your dog invested in that toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=741.0s	741.0	 Once your dog's invested in tugging on the toy, hold a treat to your dog's nose and when your dog lets go, give them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=747.0s	747.0	 Then you want to cue your dog to get the toy so you can say get it or whatever you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=753.0s	753.0	 But be careful because your dog might get your hand so you might want to use a bigger toy than I'm using here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=759.0s	759.0	 if you have a dog that might go for your hand instead of the toy. Are you ready? Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=763.0s	763.0	 So you say get it first and then move the toy around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=767.0s	767.0	 You want to make sure your dog's really invested in tugging on that toy but not too excited that he might be not wanting to let go of the toy for the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=775.0s	775.0	 If your dog doesn't let go of the toy for the treat, you need to use a lower value toy or a higher value treat to play the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=783.0s	783.0	 and maybe be less exciting about tugging on the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=787.0s	787.0	 So once you've played the game where you put the treat up towards your dog's nose and he drops the frisbee or the toy reliably,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=795.0s	795.0	 then you can start to add your cue. So you're just going to say your cue, drop and then put the treat to your dog's nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=801.0s	801.0	 Ready? Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=804.0s	804.0	 It might take a couple of training sessions to get to the next step but the next step is saying drop. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=810.0s	810.0	 Marking and then moving your hand to feed the treat. Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=814.0s	814.0	 You can mark and feed multiple times before cueing get it to teach your dog to wait for the cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=820.0s	820.0	 You can also add eye contact if your dog knows to look at you. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=826.0s	826.0	 Get it. What's this? Get it. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=834.0s	834.0	 Drop. Good. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=841.0s	841.0	 Good. Ready? Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=847.0s	847.0	 Troubleshooting for if the dog won't touch the toy if food is around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=852.0s	852.0	 Hi everybody. This is just a quick video for troubleshooting when teaching drop toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=858.0s	858.0	 So here is my little puppy, Epic, and she's really food motivated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=864.0s	864.0	 So when I have food out, she doesn't want to play with the toys. She wants to eat the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=870.0s	870.0	 And if you're working on drop with food and you're tugging with your dog and then you present a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=875.0s	875.0	 then the dog can sometimes not want to play tug anymore and want to eat the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=880.0s	880.0	 So actually right at this moment, she's realized there's some more treats up on that counter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=884.0s	884.0	 But before I started playing tug with her over here, I have some treats on that counter back there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=890.0s	890.0	 So what I'm going to do is get her invested in playing tug again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=894.0s	894.0	 And then the moment that she's tugging, I can mark her. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=899.0s	899.0	 And then go and get a treat from this cup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=904.0s	904.0	 And then I'm going to show her I have no more treats. All done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=909.0s	909.0	 And then I'm going to get her to play with the toy again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=911.0s	911.0	 And then I'm going to get her to play with the toy again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=914.0s	914.0	 And it might take some time to get her invested in playing with the toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=918.0s	918.0	 rather than going off and checking where she might get treats from.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=923.0s	923.0	 Because what she's saying to me is actually I prefer treats right now to tugging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=929.0s	929.0	 But if you go through this training, what you're going to do is get the dog to want to work for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=935.0s	935.0	 Move over so you can see if she goes over to the cup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=938.0s	938.0	 But what you're going to do is you're going to get the dog to want to work for you for the things you have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=944.0s	944.0	 And what they're learning is that the things they want, it's in their best interest to do what you want them to do to get what they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=951.0s	951.0	 So here she's tugging again. I can say good. And then I can go and get the treat from the cup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=959.0s	959.0	 So drop it and tugging are kind of like yin and yang.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=963.0s	963.0	 If you work too much on tugging, it's hard and you need to work more on teaching the dog to drop if the dog is really good at tugging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=971.0s	971.0	 But if the dog is really good at dropping for a treat, you have to reinforce tugging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=976.0s	976.0	 So that's why when she comes back and gets re-engaged in the toys that I'm playing with over here, that's when I'm going to mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=984.0s	984.0	 So I want to make sure she's engaged and she doesn't just come over and as I mark runs off,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=988.0s	988.0	 I want to make sure she's playing with this toy nicely before I mark it. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=995.0s	995.0	 Now I'm going to go get the treat. Good job, epic. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1001.0s	1001.0	 And now I'm going to say all done. Show her I have nothing so that she doesn't feel confused,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1007.0s	1007.0	 that she has to do something like perhaps sitting in order to earn the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1012.0s	1012.0	 And I'm going to play with the toys again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1013.0s	1013.0	 If I wasn't sure that she might not get the toy, I'm not going to say get it because what can happen is you say get it, get it, get it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1021.0s	1021.0	 and the dog is standing looking around for how they can get the treat off the shelf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1026.0s	1026.0	 You might even have to keep the treat in another room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1029.0s	1029.0	 So you go to the kitchen, give the dog a treat, come back and play the game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1034.0s	1034.0	 and your dog might be sitting there in the kitchen and it might take a while to get the dog invested back in the toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1039.0s	1039.0	 And then as soon as they're invested, good. And then go to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1047.0s	1047.0	 Awesome. And now I'm going to move closer to where the treats are kept and see if I can get her back interested in tugging on the toy. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1061.0s	1061.0	 That was very good, epic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1063.0s	1063.0	 Now even closer. Woohoo. Woo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1067.0s	1067.0	 Woo. Good, epic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1070.0s	1070.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1076.0s	1076.0	 Show her I have nothing and then make the toy come alive again. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1085.0s	1085.0	 Awesome job. I'm going to just zoom in a little bit so you can see what I'm doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1088.0s	1088.0	 Hi. Now she's looking over to see the cup and hoping that she could do something in order to get the treats out of the cup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1096.0s	1096.0	 But I'm going to play with the toy again. And as soon as she's invested in that toy, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1101.0s	1101.0	 I'm going to mark and reinforce. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1105.0s	1105.0	 Ready? Get it. Good. Good girl. Good girl. Get it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1118.0s	1118.0	 Good. Good. Good. Good girl. Oh yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1125.0s	1125.0	 Drop? Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1130.0s	1130.0	 Once your dog is reliably letting go when you say good to get the treats, you can instead start to say drop. So I'm going to play with her with this toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1148.0s	1148.0	 Drop. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1157.0s	1157.0	 In your training, you might not get to the point where you need to start adding the cue drop to have your dog let go of the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1165.0s	1165.0	 You simply need to say good and move towards the treats and let go of the toy because most likely the dog is going to drop the toy in order to go and get the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1173.0s	1173.0	 But in a couple of training sessions, you then might be able to add the cue drop where once the dog is engaged in tugging, and she's not that interested in tugging right now because the treats are there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1184.0s	1184.0	 So I shouldn't really be working on this with her. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1188.0s	1188.0	 But once the dog is engaged in tugging, get it, get it, get it, you then say the cue. Hold on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1195.0s	1195.0	 Then say the cue drop. Good. And then say good and go get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1200.0s	1200.0	 I'm sure her I don't have anymore. Awesome. And then get the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1206.0s	1206.0	 The next step, which I'm not sure if Epic is ready for yet is then having the treats in your bait bag or in a treat container that your dog already knows to leave in order to do behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1217.0s	1217.0	 So I have these treats in a cup over here and I'm going to try and get her interested in the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1223.0s	1223.0	 I can show her all done, but I don't have any treats in my hand like I was doing earlier with the cup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1229.0s	1229.0	 And then I'm going to wiggle the toy around and see if I might get just a tiny bit of interest in going for the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1237.0s	1237.0	 So this type of game is too hard to begin with because as you can see, you get a half hearted interest in the toy because the dog is telling you I want these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1247.0s	1247.0	 But after some training, if you break the steps up small enough with having the treats far away and move towards the treats in small approximations, you're going to keep that interest in playing with the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1259.0s	1259.0	 So at some point she's going to good. She's going to go for the toy and then I'm going to feed her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1265.0s	1265.0	 So she's not ready for this step just yet. I'm going to continue to play with her where the treats are further away and really build that interest in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1271.0s	1271.0	 Yes, I can totally play with the toy with you even though the foods the foods there on the shelf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1277.0s	1277.0	 But as you can see here, it was much harder for her in between the training sessions where you're teaching your dog to tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1283.0s	1283.0	 Even though there's food around and teaching drop using the treat, you can simply play tug with your dog and then just let go when the game's over and let the dog enjoy the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1292.0s	1292.0	 If it's appropriate for the dog to have a toy like that, you can also play a game with two toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1297.0s	1297.0	 It's better if you have two toys that are exactly the same as the dog might have a preference for another one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1304.0s	1304.0	 But it's a game that a lot of dog trainers play when they don't want to teach drop using food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1310.0s	1310.0	 And to play the game, there are different ways of playing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1313.0s	1313.0	 But a very simple way is that you move one toy and get the dog invested in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1317.0s	1317.0	 And you can move the toy back and forth gently like this so that the dog doesn't readjust their grip so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1323.0s	1323.0	 And we haven't really worked on tugging so much because she's been losing her teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1329.0s	1329.0	 So I've been avoiding tugging so that she doesn't have discomfort while we're playing tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1334.0s	1334.0	 But here she's gripping it better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1336.0s	1336.0	 And then I'm going to hold it still and to get her to change to the next toy, I'm going to wiggle the other toy around like this until she's engaged in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1345.0s	1345.0	 And when the dog starts to drop it reliably within a second of moving the other toy, you can add a cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0BKbHCWaBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=1351.0s	1351.0	 Thank you so much for watching. If you'd like to support my work, don't forget to like, comment and subscribe to my channel.
