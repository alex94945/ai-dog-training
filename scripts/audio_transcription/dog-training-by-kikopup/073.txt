https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone! I'm here with Gummy Bear the Aussie. She's my friend's dog and I'm doing a little dog sitting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 and I thought I would work on the trick of sit pretty. So she's done a little bit of training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 Basically if you teach your dog get it and they get to eat a treat out of your hand, get it like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 and you ask your dog to sit and then you just hold the treat a little bit higher up over their head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 and then cue them to get it. So I'm going to say get it, good, get it, awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 And then I'm just going to hold it a little higher so she has to do a little pop up to get the treat like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 Good job. Get it, awesome. Get it, awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 So I have the treat in my hand like this. Get it. And it's a treat that's easy to give.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 It's a piece of kibble so nothing too messy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 The next step is not having a treat. So I don't have a treat here and I'm just clicking her for getting into the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS3vu2Hi5A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=74&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 Awesome, good girl.
