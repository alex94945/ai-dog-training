https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This is what my Border Collies look like when I let them out the door to the training field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 They just sit and stare at the house or sniff around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 They actually don't play with all the toys that I have out for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=12.5s	12.5	 And I have toys out for them in the house and in the yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 And they're actually the ones that I train them with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=18.5s	18.5	 And so it's not about gaining access to the toy that's reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 It's playing with the toy with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 They can have fun playing with each other with toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 But in training, they really get the reinforcement from the interaction with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=35.5s	35.5	 So you don't have to go around not letting your dog play with toys in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxlIhZjBeEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=39.5s	39.5	 It's all about building that fun of the game with you.
