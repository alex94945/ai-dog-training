https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, this video is on the topic of the advantages and the disadvantages to using crates and tethers with young puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 Now in my opinion, it's extremely important to teach every puppy how to behave when in a small confined area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 like a crate as well as on a short leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 This is because even though you might not intend for your puppy to ever be in that situation in their whole life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=23.9s	23.9	 because you live in the country, at some point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=26.7s	26.7	 there might be an emergency or you might need to go to the vet and your dog will have to be on a leash as well as have to be in a crate if they're going to get an operation for something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=33.7s	33.7	 Say your dog's broken their leg and they need to be kept in a crate in the back room of the vet before the operation or after they wake up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=43.7s	43.7	 So for me, it's extremely important to teach dogs how to behave on a leash and in a crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=50.5s	50.5	 When on a short leash or in a crate, a dog's movement is very limited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 They can literally stand up, turn around and lay down again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 So I believe it's extremely important for us to teach dogs that when they're in a situation where they can't make any choices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=65.6s	65.6	 that they should enjoy relaxing, it's time for a nap or just to settle and look around in the environment and know that they will be released at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=75.7s	75.7	 Without training your dog what to do when confined on a short leash or in a crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=80.1s	80.1	 some dogs are going to be okay with it and figure it out that it's a time to relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 But other dogs with different personalities might feel frustrated, stressed or even anxious in these situations without any training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 I like to think of it in the way that what a person would feel like is most likely similar to being trapped in an elevator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 You have all these intentions about what you're going to be doing during the day and then suddenly the elevator closes and doesn't open again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=110.2s	110.2	 And that can feel for some people very stressful, frustrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=113.7s	113.7	 And when you had intentions of doing other things and not being standing in an elevator,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=118.9s	118.9	 the time in the elevator can be extremely stressful and for some people even frightening because you don't know if you're going to get out again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 And I believe that's how some dogs feel when they're put into crates and they've had no training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=132.5s	132.5	 So I like to train the crate as a bedroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=137.1s	137.1	 So when the dog goes into the crate they know it's time for sleeping and when the door opens then the sleeping time is over like a bedroom rather than an elevator.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=147.7s	147.7	 When you've taught your puppy or dog to settle when on a short leash or in a crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=152.3s	152.3	 it can then become an amazing tool to help you with managing your dog's behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=157.2s	157.2	 Say for example if you'd like to go to a cafe with your dog you can sit down and because the dog is confined to a short leash they know it's time to relax and take a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=167.5s	167.5	 Or if you need to go on a plane somewhere and your dog goes into their crate it's a great way for the puppy or the dog to relax on the plane being in their little crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=177.3s	177.3	 I personally love bringing a crate or a short leash and a mat to parks and places where if I'm going to be there all day the dog needs a break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=187.3s	187.3	 And the perfect place for a dog to relax and get some sleep is inside of a crate or on his mat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=194.3s	194.3	 Personally I prefer the crate because the dog knows that nothing's going to bother him while he's asleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=200.1s	200.1	 So I always bring crates for my dogs if we're going to be doing some all-day event so they can relax and have a break when they need to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=208.3s	208.3	 Crates and leashes are also great for managing behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=211.7s	211.7	 For example introducing dogs together where you're practicing working on dogs settling near each other and the leash is there for safety in case one dog were to get up and overwhelm the other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=222.9s	222.9	 Another great use for a crate is that once your puppy understands that a crate is about taking a nap or settling then you can take the crate and put it in your car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=231.7s	231.7	 And then it makes it so much easier to train your puppy to relax and take a nap while you're driving somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=237.5s	237.5	 Now if you don't train your puppy to be calm and relaxed in the car what can happen if you go exciting places is that your dog can learn to walk around inside of your car looking out the windows and getting excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=250.1s	250.1	 And then when you get to the place that you want to go the dog can be way too excited and it can kind of interfere with your training of teaching your dog to walk in on a loose leash when out and about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 There are some disadvantages to using crates and tethers with puppies and for me the biggest one is that it really limits their movement and choices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=270.1s	270.1	 So young puppies are kind of like human toddlers. They need to move around constantly for a large period during the day because their body won't grow normally if they're not moving around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=283.5s	283.5	 If their movement is limited to standing up turning around and laying down their body is going to grow differently than if they were loose moving around and interacting with the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=293.3s	293.3	 Because as they're doing that they're building their the correct muscles and their legs are going to grow normally with the movement where if their movement is too limited and they're spending way too much time on a leash or in a crate they're not going to grow in the same way as a dog that is loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=312.2s	312.2	 Their brains also in my opinion aren't going to grow the same way if the dog isn't interacting with the environment like the toys in the environment and the nature outside if they're just on a leash or in a crate prevented from doing any sort of activity or making any choices of their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=330.9s	330.9	 So in my opinion in conjunction with training your dog to relax and take a nap when on a short leash or in a crate it's extremely important for us to teach our puppies what to do when loose in the area that you're going to be leaving your dog as an adult.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=346.3s	346.3	 So you might have your dog inside your house or confined to a bedroom or something like that when you're gone and that way during the day while you're at work your dog can make choices that involve moving around and using their body rather than just standing up turning around and laying down again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=364.6s	364.6	 Now if you keep your puppy or your dog on a leash and in the crate all the time that's not going to teach your puppy what to do when loose in your living room or loose when home alone so it's extremely important to work on those behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=379.9s	379.9	 I personally when I get a new puppy I'm not tethering the puppy to me because in that first two weeks the puppy's literally a blank slate in your house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=391.1s	391.1	 They have no reinforcement history of anything that they want to do and so I'll have my puppy loose and I'll be showing my puppy all the behaviors and all the things I want him to be doing when loose and interrupting him and getting his attention when he starts to have ideas about what he would want to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=409.8s	409.8	 And by doing this for two weeks I usually with every puppy have a puppy that can be loose in the house extremely fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=417.5s	417.5	 The only thing you want to keep in mind is that when you have a young puppy that's around eight weeks they're going to be chewing on stuff because of their teeth growing in and then once the chewing ends you think you're scot-free and that the puppy's never going to chew on anything again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=433.8s	433.8	 But as they hit around five months or around 20 weeks sometimes even 18 weeks they can start to want to chew on stuff again and then you'll need to use management.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=444.9s	444.9	 So I suggest that you shouldn't leave a puppy loose until they're about six months old but instead of confining a puppy to a crate or on a short leash I suggest that the puppy has a large pen when the owner can't watch the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=463.7s	463.7	 And direct the puppy to be making the correct choices about what to do when loose in their house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=470.9s	470.9	 On the internet there's a lot of information about using a crate or a tether to teach your puppy not to go to the toilet inside your house but in my opinion it's more important to focus on the idea of teaching your puppy where you do want them to go which is outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=485.4s	485.4	 So instead of confining the puppy to a crate and a leash all the time while inside so they're not wanting to go to the toilet in the same area that they're laying I suggest having the puppy loose and then frequently taking the puppy out when he wakes up from a nap when he's just eaten when he's just had some water when he's just played when you've just done some training together those are the perfect times to take a puppy out to see if he'll go to the bathroom and also taking the puppy out extremely frequently and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=515.4s	515.4	 reinforcing your puppy when he does go outside and I do have information on house training and I'll link that in the description below but for me it's extremely important to teach our puppy the skills of being loose in your house and not always confined to a leash or a crate because what can also happen is if a puppy and I've seen this a lot because I get a lot of emails from people that they've been house training their puppy by keeping them in a crate or on a leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=545.4s	545.4	 all the time and then when the puppy's not in the crate or the leash the puppy doesn't know how to behave and starts to behave abnormally so some of the things that I've seen and this is not based on any science it's just opinion and experience but what I've experienced a lot is puppies where they're kept too long in a crate and too long in a leash when let loose they tend to have pica which is they start to devour things that they see so when let loose they just start eating things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=575.4s	575.4	 like coins or pebbles or trying to eat bark obsessively and when I've suggested to not have the puppy ever in a crate for a few weeks and instead in a pen the puppies have stopped obsessively eating things another thing is biting really hard and being over excited so a lot of puppies they immediately sleep on a leash or in a crate but when loose in the house they don't know how to settle and they run around excitedly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=605.4s	605.4	 just doing stuff obsessively so if you notice that that is happening it could be that the puppy is spending too much time in a small confined area or confined on a leash and the side effects are showing when the puppy is loose so for me to prevent these side effects when I do leave my puppy I like to leave my puppy in a large pen a puppy proof pen so they can't make any mistakes that has a crate with a bed in it some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=635.4s	635.4	 toys and some water if the puppy is extremely unhouse trained I might have puppy pads in there but if I'm home and I'm working on house training I'll put the puppy into that pen when I can't watch the puppy and then the puppy can move around and make choices naturally and have their body grow naturally where they feel like moving and they can then I will frequently take the puppy out to go to the bathroom and then put the puppy back in the pen and get back to work maybe I'm editing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=665.4s	665.4	 a video or something like that and then the puppy can make choices while I'm working in regards to tethering your puppy or your new adult dog to you the whole time that you're home with your dog I've actually found some disadvantages to that and one is if you don't train your puppy not to pull on leash or what to do when on a leash before doing this what you can do is teach your puppy to pull on leash because if you just tie them to you at certain points what's going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=695.4s	695.4	 happen is the puppy is going to want to do other things and every time they pull they're going to be rehearsing pulling on leash the other possible disadvantage that I've noticed when clients have told me that they've used this method in the past is that the dog has a tendency to have less interest in the person that they're attached to than the other members of the family so a lot of times people will want their dog to bond with their say their child who the dog is going to be the service dog for but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=725.4s	725.4	 when the dog is has to be with the person and can't get away so they're constantly with the person and there are other people that the dog would like to interact with sometimes it can work against the idea of bonding and the dog just literally wants to get away from the person and get to do the things that he wants to do so for that circumstance I believe the best way to build that bond in that relationship is through choice and reinforcement when animals find it reinforcing to be with you that's going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=755.4s	755.4	 to build your relationship with your animal where they have to be with you all the time and they have no choice to get away that's not going to that's going to habituate them to being around you but to really build your relationship it's extremely important to use reinforcement so in that example of a family wanting the dog to like the child that they're going to be the service dog for the best way to do that would be for the kid to use the highest value treats and perhaps the family when they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=785.4s	785.4	 train the dog they use lower value treats than that child and that when that child works with the dog they're using a really high rate of reinforcement and maybe with the parents they're using less high rate of reinforcement so the dog is realizing wow this kid is amazing so the question that you might be wanting to ask is how long is too long for my puppy or adult dog to be kept in a crate daily and in my opinion the answer is it really depends on your dog's genetics their personality their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=815.4s	815.4	 previous training and their previous history of behavior inside of a crate so for example if you have a mellow dog that likes to sleep all the time and like small spaces then that dog is going to do way better being kept in a crate than another dog that is more active or a dog that is very impulsive and feels frustrated when he wants to do something and he's blocked from doing that certain thing so I find those dogs don't do as well in a crate because their choices are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=845.4s	845.4	 confined to very little choices of basically just standing up turning around and laying down again and I find for some dogs that is very frustrating for them and it's hard for them to actually enjoy being in a crate so yes we can teach some dogs to spend a few hours in a crate but there are other dogs that could spend 8 hours and be perfectly happy coming out for example when I flew from Sweden to San Diego and my little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=875.4s	875.4	 dogs were in their crates they were in their crates for 9 and a half hours and when I opened the door for them to come out they didn't come out of their crates because they were relaxed and happy sure they had full bladders but they were so comfortable they didn't want to come out where other dogs the 9 hours even with tons of training would have been extremely stressful for some dogs so for me as I previously said I like to train the dogs to be loose or confined to a single room in the house when being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWE-xl0rnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=222&pp=iAQB&t=905.4s	905.4	 left and that way the dog can make choices as to what to do when home alone rather than be in a crate but you might have to use a crate for some reason for example you're at a hotel and they have to be in crates at hotels or your dogs never been in a hotel before and you know your dogs going to be better in a crate then loosen the room but if you're keeping your dog in a crate because you know they're going to destroy your house or go to the toilet all over your
