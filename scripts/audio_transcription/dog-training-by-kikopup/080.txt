https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone and welcome to Kikopup's dog training tip of the day for today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4.4s	4.4	 Today I'm going to be showing you guys how to train drop at heel using a mat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=9.6s	9.6	 It's a super impressive behavior to show your friends and get people excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=15.7s	15.7	 about training their dogs. So I hope you give this exercise a try. It's a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=19.9s	19.9	 way to build fun, reliability and your communication system with your dog. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=26.3s	26.3	 treats don't have to happen or reinforcement doesn't have to happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 near you. It can happen away from you and you can build that confidence of being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 away from you with this exercise. So a good idea is to first teach your dog to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=40.3s	40.3	 enjoy going to a mat and laying down or sitting or choosing a position you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 your dog to stay in. If you're going to be doing lots of advanced work you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=51.4s	51.4	 can teach your dog to do different positions on the mat depending on what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 cue you give. So for this game we're going to teach the dog to down on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=60.7s	60.7	 mat. So what I'm going to do is throw a treat back here for her to get and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=66.8s	66.8	 I'm going to cue her to down every time she gets to the mat and reinforce her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=72.1s	72.1	 and then practice walking away from her. So she's getting used to being left on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=77.5s	77.5	 the mat and you can see that she doesn't yet get that she's supposed to stay there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=82.7s	82.7	 Down. Good. And now I'm going to release her. Good. So you might say instead of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=91.1s	91.1	 release to your front you might say your heel cue. Mine is called tight so that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=97.4s	97.4	 my cue for the left heel. And so the end result which we haven't worked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 on this yet with her she's like I should go to the mat and sit. Is that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 going to cue your dog to heel with you. Tight. When you get to the mat they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=112.7s	112.7	 going to down and then you're going to leave them. But the next step is walking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 to the mat with the dog asking them to down marking and reinforcing the down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 and then either saying let's go and moving together or heel or whatever cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=126.9s	126.9	 you want or you down the dog and you leave the dog. Good. So I'm just going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 practice that and see if we can get epic my little chihuahua of one year old to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=140.6s	140.6	 do a drop on down in the heel position. Free. Good girl. Here we go. So what I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=147.9s	147.9	 using is some deli meat that I got from a store called Barrens and they make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=155.7s	155.7	 their own deli meat and it's actually cheaper than buying dog treats. Some of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=163.1s	163.1	 those expensive dog treats and it doesn't have it has like lemon and like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=167.1s	167.1	 ingredients that don't have preservatives so I like to go there to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=170.4s	170.4	 buy if I use deli meat because the other deli meat has lots of salt and lots of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 added stuff. Anyway she really likes this deli meat so she's really you know on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=180.9s	180.9	 top of her game right now. Sometimes she can be a little disinterested in treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=184.8s	184.8	 because she's so small and she can fill up easily so I make sure to not give you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 know measure out how many treats I'm going to give per training session and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=194.2s	194.2	 make sure that I don't overfeed her every day. Are you ready? Let's do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=198.5s	198.5	 and stop talking. Sorry. Okay here we go. So I'm going to say tight, down, mark and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=205.8s	205.8	 reinforce her for being down like this and then take a step away. Mark and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=211.9s	211.9	 reinforce her for staying there and I might practice that again and again. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=217.3s	217.3	 actually think because of her fear of being stood on because she's been stood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 on by people that this is easy for her but me coming back to her is the part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=227.9s	227.9	 that I really need to work on and that's going to build her confidence with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=231.7s	231.7	 trusting that when I've sat down I'm not going to then stand on her so I'm easing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=236.9s	236.9	 myself into the position much slower than I naturally would go to build her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=241.6s	241.6	 confidence slowly. Good job. Tight. Awesome. So that wasn't as fast as I wanted her to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 get off of the mat but there is a wall right here so she's not thinking to run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=257.5s	257.5	 straight into the heel position so I could play games if I wanted her to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=261.2s	261.2	 speed up to reach me by using more space so she's further away I say tight and she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 runs and I run away from her to build that speed. Okay come epic let's give it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=273.1s	273.1	 a try now. I don't know if she'll be able to do it but let's try. Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 Tight, down. So she I wasn't fast enough with my click she got up and moved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 forwards but I just want her to make sure that she understands the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=290.4s	290.4	 reinforcement zone is the mat so I'm not going to tell her no I just want to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=295.2s	295.2	 that the reinforcing place to be when I move away when I've sat down. Free. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=302.6s	302.6	 girl. Let's try that again. Let's see if you can get it. Ready? Tight. Down. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=312.9s	312.9	 And she got it. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=317.7s	317.7	 Free. Tight. Nice. Ready? Let's go this direction. Down. Awesome. Free. Now when I went this

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 first when they approach something there they might look down at it because they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=341.1s	341.1	 don't want to trip so a game you can work on is simply walking over the mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=346.9s	346.9	 and marking them for looking up at you and you could even take turns and move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=352.2s	352.2	 around like this and then gradually get rid of the treat in your hand so they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=357.4s	357.4	 getting used to walking over the mat sitting on the mat without having to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=386.8s	386.8	 girl. Ready? Tight. Down. There we go. That's nice. Okay well I'm running out of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=401.5s	401.5	 thought she did really well. This is the first time we've done this exercise but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqPTj--v3U8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=404.9s	404.9	 what we have worked on is go to the mat comfortable being near me in the heel
