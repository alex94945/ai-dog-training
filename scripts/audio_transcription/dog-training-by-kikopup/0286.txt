https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everyone, today I'm going to give you some tips for training drop a heel using a mat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 Now, the reason that I like to use a non-slip pad and mat to train this is one, it gives the dog a target to know to lay down and stay in the treat station when you move ahead of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 But, it also will prevent your dog's feet slipping around when your dog stops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 So, I don't train on a hard slippery surface and you'll see why course slash is going to be a demo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 You can see her feet are slipping around and if I cue her to do things like down and stand up, you can see she's slipping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 And those tiny slips are not only not good for their body, but they're going to ruin your training because you're not going to get the accurate footwork that you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 The first step is teaching the dog that the mat is going to predict that you're going to cue them to do a down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 So, I don't suggest having your dog in the heel position, you can simply lower your dog over the mat and then cue them to lay down with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Good job! And then you can mark your feet, your dog for staying on the mat. Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 Or yes, whatever mark or word you use. And then give your release cue free. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 The next step is walking away from your dog while your dog stays on the mat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 And you can make it easier for your dog by turning to face them as you walk away because it might be a whole different concept to your dog when you leave them while they're doing heel work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 Are you ready? So, I'm going to cue her to down. Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 Take a step away, come back and give her a treat. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 When your dog is good at you walking away while looking at them, you can start to walk away while not looking at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 So, while they're laying down already, you can start walking away. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 If your dog were to get up, which way? Then you can simply lower them back to the mat and make it a little easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 So, you just take a better step forwards and now Wish thinks she should crawl in the heel work position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 I'm going to reward her for that because I think that was cute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 Anyway, down. Good. So, I'm just going to take a small step forwards. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 Good job. Push free. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 Now you can practice with your dog in the heel position. Are you ready? Tight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 If you want to make it easy for your dog, you can lower them into the down position before you walk forwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Push free. Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 If you have a dog like Kiko, that when you get to the mat, they look down at it just before they step onto it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 I suggest using a mat that isn't too tall that they might trip on it because it could be that they're worried that they're going to trip as they step onto it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 And you can simply work on approaching the mat and not asking for the down yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 So, with Kiko here, I'm just going to get near the mat and as we walk onto it, without her looking down, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 Tight. Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 When you finally remove the mat, you want to make it easier for your dog by reverting back to using Lauren and asking for the behavior in the same place that the mat was just in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 Are you ready? Tight. Down. Good. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 Push free. Down. Good. Good girl. Push free. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 This game is great for canine freestyle as well. Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unjAZ6SSGBs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=287&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 Bravo. And down. Good.
