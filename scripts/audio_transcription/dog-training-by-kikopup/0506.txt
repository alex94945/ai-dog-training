https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, a lot of people have been asking me to make a video on house training, their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 new rescue dog, or puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 There are two basic concepts to house training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=10.1s	10.1	 One, you want to teach your dog where you do want them to go, and two, you want to prevent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=14.9s	14.9	 your dog from going in the places you don't want them to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=18.9s	18.9	 Training your dog where you do want them to go is very, very simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=22.1s	22.1	 All you have to do is take your dog to the area on leash, or put them in a pen where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 you want them to go, and wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 At some point, your dog is going to go to the bathroom, and at that point you can click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=32.4s	32.4	 and give the dog a treat, or say yes and give your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=35.4s	35.4	 Now, you don't want to click or say yes too early, or the dog can actually stop peeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=39.9s	39.9	 to get their treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=40.9s	40.9	 Go pee!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=53.9s	53.9	 Good boy, yay!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 Good boy, Emmy, good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=58.6s	58.6	 You've earned an opportunity for freedom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=61.6s	61.6	 Yeah, woohoo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 So, the hard part about house training is training your dog where you don't want them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=69.8s	69.8	 The key concept to training your dog where you don't want them to go is prevention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=74.6s	74.6	 You want to prevent any reinforcement of peeing in the house, and really reinforce peeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=79.9s	79.9	 in the appropriate areas, so your dog wouldn't even think twice to go inside of the house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=85.3s	85.3	 or wherever you don't want him to pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=87.7s	87.7	 Every time your dog makes a mistake and pees in the house, they're being reinforced for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 going to the bathroom inside the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=94.4s	94.4	 When I was a child in Africa, we had an outside toilet and we had an inside toilet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=99.1s	99.1	 It was very rare that I'd want to use the outside toilet, because I'd have to go outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 the house and go to the bathroom there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=104.5s	104.5	 When there was a toilet inside, I would just use that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=106.6s	106.6	 So, you can see how even little dogs who love comfort, they don't want to go outside where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=111.3s	111.3	 it's cold, the grass is wet, they don't want to get their feet wet, it's highly reinforcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=116.2s	116.2	 if they've already had a reinforcement history of peeing in the house, they're going to choose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=120.7s	120.7	 the house over the yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 That corner upstairs in your parent's bedroom, they're going to choose that corner over going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 out the door, or waiting at the door for 10 minutes while you ignore them to go outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=132.8s	132.8	 in the wet grass and get cold and shiver, and it's not a nice experience for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=137.6s	137.6	 So you really have to build that as a nice experience and remove the reinforcement value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=143.3s	143.3	 of going to the bathroom inside of the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 How do you prevent dogs from going to the bathroom inside the house?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 The first few weeks that you own your dog, or you begin this training plan of having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 them never pee in the house, you want to have your eyes on that dog 100% of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=159.8s	159.8	 Every moment that you cannot see where your dog is, that is the moment they might be going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=163.8s	163.8	 to the bathroom and learning to go to the bathroom inside the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=167.3s	167.3	 So you have to use prevention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=169.1s	169.1	 The dog's going to be on leash with you, the dog's going to be in their appropriate pen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=172.5s	172.5	 that has a toilet, the dog's going to be in a crate, the dog's going to be outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=176.4s	176.4	 where it's safe, the dog is going to be on your lap while you're working on the computer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=181.7s	181.7	 or on leash at your feet while you're working on the computer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=186.7s	186.7	 And that equals prevention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 If you see the dog going to the bathroom, you can now take action and prevent it from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=193.3s	193.3	 being reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=194.7s	194.7	 What you're going to do when you're watching your dog and you see them going to the bathroom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=198.5s	198.5	 in the house, you're going to interrupt them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 They're started sniffing, pop pop, let's go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 And you make your way outside as quickly as you can, and if they go to the bathroom outside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=207.5s	207.5	 you're going to highly reinforce them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=209.4s	209.4	 Most likely they won't go to the bathroom outside because they've just been rushed out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=212.7s	212.7	 and they've completely forgotten that they were going to pee.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 If they don't, go back to the prevention method, put them back in the crate or on leash or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=222.7s	222.7	 on your lap.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 horrible thing they can learn is, ooh, when my human's around, he doesn't like it when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=234.2s	234.2	 I go to the bathroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 So you can actually prevent your dog from going to the bathroom in your presence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=239.6s	239.6	 So when you're outside with your dog on leash, they're not going to want to go to the bathroom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=242.7s	242.7	 because you shout at them every time they go to the bathroom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=245.7s	245.7	 Another thing is they can learn, ooh, it's okay to go to the bathroom when my human was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=249.8s	249.8	 gone, but when my human was present, it was not okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=253.3s	253.3	 So to go to the bathroom, it's reinforcing if they're not watching, but if they're watching,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=257.5s	257.5	 I get punished.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=258.5s	258.5	 So you get a dog that never pees in front of you in the house and sneaks away to pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=262.9s	262.9	 It's very hard to house train a dog like that where if they're relaxed with you, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=268.7s	268.7	 going to squat right in front of you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=273.3s	273.3	 So once your dog's getting pretty good at house training, you can start having them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=277.2s	277.2	 in one room with you so they have access to the living room.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=284.7s	284.7	 the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, and upstairs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=293.3s	293.3	 So what do you do if you have a dog that's already peed in the house multiple times?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=299.9s	299.9	 Well first, you want to take action and get rid of those things that the dog pees on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=304.9s	304.9	 So if it's something cheap like a dog bed, a rug, a cheap rug, a pillow, get rid of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77--cCHPyU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=507&pp=iAQB&t=311.3s	311.3	 Just throw it away.
