https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, I've been getting a lot of requests about what I've been doing in the first week with my puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=6.2s	6.2	 So I'm making this video about what I've been specifically training my own little pup. Now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=11.6s	11.6	 It really depends on your dog what you train first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=14.5s	14.5	 And I actually have a video that I'll link below that's called what to train first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=19.9s	19.9	 And it really depends on your dog's personality, their genetics, the experience they had in the womb and also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 extremely importantly what happened in those first eight weeks will really depend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 Will really determine what you need to work on. So for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=37.5s	37.5	 The stuff that I did with my previous puppy my little border collie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=41.2s	41.2	 Halo is extremely different than what I've worked on with this little one. Oh, she wants to eat my microphone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=47.9s	47.9	 Basically she couldn't be left alone when I got her so that was the number one issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 That I was working on with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 But halo the breeder had actually worked on separation training with all the puppies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 So I could leave halo for a couple of hours right from the start and he was confident and all he did was want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=66.8s	66.8	 Go to sleep or play with his toys when left alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=69.3s	69.3	 So a huge focus for this little one has been teaching her to be comfortable left alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=75.5s	75.5	 And I'll make a separate video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 Tutorial on working on that with a little puppy or and a dog that you might have adopted that is struggling with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 Being anxious when you leave them alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 The three things I focused on with this little pup was one building our relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 which I would do with any dog using the attention game teaching the recall and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 Teaching her an attention noise a little kissy noise and I'll link how to train that in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=104.8s	104.8	 So I could interrupt her behavior if she was doing something that I didn't like and then I could redirect her to doing things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=111.2s	111.2	 I do want her to do so this has been very helpful to interrupt her behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Say if she was running over to bother one of my dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 I could interrupt her and then get her to play with one of her toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 So that was important for the separation training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=124.8s	124.8	 I not only worked on teaching her to be alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=127.3s	127.3	 But I also worked on teaching her to want to move away from me to go to her dog bed and to go inside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=134.3s	134.3	 A crate and to go inside a pen so that movement of choice to go away from me to lay down to receive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=141.9s	141.9	 Reinforcement and really building that concept of laying down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 So at first when I got her if the room was very cold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 She didn't want to lay down on the carpet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=150.4s	150.4	 So what I did was use a very cushy blanket that was very soft and velvety and very soft
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 Surfaces like my bed to initially get the behavior of laying down. I also worked on capturing the subtle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=163.2s	163.2	 So anytime I noticed that she was settling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=165.3s	165.3	 I would go and drop a tiny little treat between her paws and I'll link a video on how to train that in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=172.4s	172.4	 Your environment and the social situations that your puppy is going to be in throughout their life will also determine what you'll focus on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 So I live with five other dogs. So that was an extremely important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=184.5s	184.5	 Part of her training is to teach her to get on really well with the other dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 So I made a video about introducing her to my other dogs and I also have a video on how I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 Introduced dogs to each other that I'll link in the description below, but that was the biggest focus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=200.7s	200.7	 So for her my two main
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=203.5s	203.5	 focuses were teaching her to be confident alone because I saw that as being her number one issue and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=210.5s	210.5	 being respectful and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 Reinforcing my dogs for being with each other without interfering with each other and building on positive experiences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=219.9s	219.9	 around each other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 The most important things to work on with your own puppy in the first week that are really important is one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=227.5s	227.5	 Starting to work on teaching the puppy to ignore clothing and fast movements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=232.2s	232.2	 So they're not going after your shoes your pants the leash and I'll link a video tutorial on how to work on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=238.4s	238.4	 That's extremely important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=240.2s	240.2	 Building your relationship with your puppy using the attention game the recall working on handling and grooming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=247.3s	247.3	 This pup is amazing with handling and grooming so I haven't focused on that as much especially because her belly is so tiny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 I can only limit the training to just you know, maybe 30 to 60 tiny pieces of food a day because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 You know smaller than the head of a pin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=266.8s	266.8	 Because there's just no more room in her belly where with a larger breed puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=270.8s	270.8	 You could work on a lot more in a day using their dog using your dog's food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=275.2s	275.2	 So I've also got her interested in playing with toys so in the future I can do more training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=280.7s	280.7	 Rather than the limit of how much she can eat per day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=285.7s	285.7	 But with other puppies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=287.9s	287.9	 It's really important to teach them what to do when they're loose in your living room and this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=292.8s	292.8	 She's just naturally with just a little bit of training in the first day of getting her hooked on her own toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 She's ignored everything else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=301.2s	301.2	 Around the house and doesn't chew on things yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=304.4s	304.4	 But if she were to I would interrupt her and then redirect her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=308.8s	308.8	 Using the kissy noise to then play with something that already exists in the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=313.5s	313.5	 So with my little pups, I really like to have them loose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=317.5s	317.5	 in the living room and really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 Watch them a hundred percent of the time and guide the choices that they're making to set them up for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=326.4s	326.4	 Rather than letting them rehearse things and find out they really really like them like chewing on the table legs and things like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=335.1s	335.1	 other things to work on with just the average puppy is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=340.2s	340.2	 Socialization and I have a 30 minute video on socializing a puppy and I'll link that in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 I also have one socializing during the times of kovat because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=352.5s	352.5	 The pandemic hasn't ended yet and I'll link that video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=356.3s	356.3	 So it's how to stay safe and socialize your puppy at the same time, which is what I'm doing with this little one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=363.8s	363.8	 so I've had guests visit in my yard where we can socially distance and she's gotten to meet people and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=372.4s	372.4	 Luckily, I have my brother staying with me at the moment so it's nice to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=377.6s	377.6	 Someone else coming in and out of the house. So she gets used to that. But obviously with kovat that's not always
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=384.7s	384.7	 possible house training is also a really important thing to focus on with your puppy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 The way that I do it is that anytime that there's in a change in activity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=395.4s	395.4	 So she's done playing she's done eating she's done sleeping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 I will take her out or take her to a pee pad because I want to train her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=404.2s	404.2	 To go in a box with a pee pad so that I can say for example if I stayed at a hotel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=411.1s	411.1	 She can go there. Also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=413.4s	413.4	 There was a mountain lion spotted near my house recently and they're owls at night. So because she's so small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=420.1s	420.1	 I've been a little bit freaked out about taking her outside with the other dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=423.8s	423.8	 To go to the bathroom even in my yard. So at night I have her go in the box
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=430.3s	430.3	 For safety reasons because she's so tiny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=432.6s	432.6	 It's pretty scary to have such a small dog and I just want to keep her safety in mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=438.0s	438.0	 But it's also handy like if you go to a hotel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=441.1s	441.1	 In a busy city
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=442.4s	442.4	 You can have the the box with the pee pad in your room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=445.6s	445.6	 So the puppy doesn't have to go all the way out in the morning to a busy street where there might not be any grass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e_gVqJkdek&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=174&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 Or anywhere where there aren't lots of people walking back and forth that might be
