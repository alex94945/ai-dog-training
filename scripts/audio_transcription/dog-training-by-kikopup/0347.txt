https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, today I want to show you a technique that I created for training loose leash walking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 when out on a walk and using food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=8.3s	8.3	 This little tutorial comes from my presentation that I'm going to be presenting at the Pet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 Professional Guild's Force Free Summit that is coming out this November, November 11th
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 through 13th.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 And there's still spaces, so if you want a ticket, you have to go to their website,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=25.1s	25.1	 the Pet Professional Guild's website, and sign up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=28.6s	28.6	 It's going to be in Tampa, Florida.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=31.1s	31.1	 So I'm really excited to be doing this because leash walking is one of my favorite things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=36.1s	36.1	 And this specific technique I just had to share with everyone to give you a little tidbit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=40.1s	40.1	 a little taster of what's to come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=42.7s	42.7	 But the inspiration for this technique is Lacey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=46.5s	46.5	 You know, we tried everything to train Lacey to walk on a loose leash, but every time you'd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 give her a treat on a walk, she's walking nicely, you give her a treat, suddenly after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=55.5s	55.5	 eating the treat, she'd run and hit the end of the leash, which is very frustrating because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 she was doing so well until you give her the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 And that happens with a lot of clients' dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=65.8s	65.8	 So I came up with this way of stopping that from happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=70.5s	70.5	 And basically, what we're teaching the dog is after eating the treat, the dog has to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=76.6s	76.6	 then wait for permission to move forwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 So I will show you how to do that right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=83.1s	83.1	 So you want to train this exercise in a non-distracting environment at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 So after a couple training sessions where you really build the behavior, then you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=91.2s	91.2	 attempt to try it on a walk when your dog's been highly reinforced for doing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 So what you're going to do is you're going to give your dog a treat and then just after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=99.8s	99.8	 they're done eating it, you're going to ask your dog for eye contact using an attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 noise or their name that you previously trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 If you haven't trained an attention noise, there will be a link to a video tutorial down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 here that you can follow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 So once you've asked for your dog's attention and they look at you, you're going to click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=118.3s	118.3	 and then reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 So by repeating this over and over again, what you're teaching your dog is that after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=124.2s	124.2	 eating a treat, they can predict that they're going to have to look at you afterwards to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=129.1s	129.1	 get more food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 Instead of what usually happens on a walk where they're walking perfectly, you feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 them, they know they're not going to get a treat for a very long time, so they rush
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 The end result is that you're going to feed your dog a treat, they're going to look at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=144.7s	144.7	 you expectantly and the reward is going to be access to the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=149.9s	149.9	 So they've eaten their treat, they wait, they look at you and then you move forward saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=153.5s	153.5	 let's go and the reward is to keep walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=156.9s	156.9	 Okay, so here it goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=159.9s	159.9	 First I'm going to feed her a treat and then make the kissing noise and then reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 her for looking at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 So I'm going to feed her a treat and I'm putting it on the floor because she's already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=172.8s	172.8	 offering lots of attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 After practicing this exercise multiple times, you can see if your dog might offer you the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 behavior of giving you eye contact after eating the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 So I'm just going to warm her up by repeating it one more time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=189.6s	189.6	 I'm going to feed her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=192.6s	192.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=195.6s	195.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=203.6s	203.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 Now you can add in some steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 So you're going to walk along, click your dog, feed and see if your dog will offer you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 If your dog doesn't, immediately make the kissing noise, give them a hint and click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=218.6s	218.6	 and reinforce your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 If for some reason your dog's not responding to their attention noise, you simply need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=224.6s	224.6	 to go back and really work on it and reinforce it so it's a strong behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=228.6s	228.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=230.6s	230.6	 So the final step is you're walking along on a walk, you have your food and your dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 being awesome, you can say yes and reinforce them by walking nicely at your side and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=239.6s	239.6	 you're going to wait, wait for eye contact and then give them the cue, let's go, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=244.6s	244.6	 continue walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=246.6s	246.6	 When working on this exercise inside, it's okay if you can't get your dog to stop looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=250.6s	250.6	 at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 So you're going to just feed a treat or put a treat on the ground and then click and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 your dog for looking at you after they eat the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=258.6s	258.6	 But when you're on a walk, I wouldn't suggest feeding your dog for looking at you while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=263.6s	263.6	 you're walking because what that can teach them is that they only walk on a loose leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 while they're watching you and then when they're not watching you, they forge ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 So the moments that you want to initially mark when you're walking is when the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=277.6s	277.6	 is walking at your side but not staring at you or paying attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=283.6s	283.6	 They're just walking calmly at your side, enjoying their life, looking around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=287.6s	287.6	 That's when you're going to mark, feed, and then after that you're going to wait for eye
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=292.6s	292.6	 contact before giving the dog permission to continue walking with a cue like let's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=298.6s	298.6	 or whatever cue you want to use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=300.6s	300.6	 I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I look forward to seeing everyone at the PPG Summit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHyIV8eTkvU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=348&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 in Florida.
