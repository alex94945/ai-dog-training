https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=27.4s	27.4	 like the environment. So just being in that environment with your dog so it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 not like he only goes in there and it's just somewhere he goes that's kind of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 could sit in here read a book. When he comes back and I'm gonna click him and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=44.5s	44.5	 give him a treat. Good boy! Maybe in his bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 So now I'm just gonna click and feed him. He's not seeing me throw him in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 Click and feed him for staying in the pen while the door is open. And you can just be filming him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=76.7s	76.7	 He's in the roll and he's not used to treat delivery so he's kind of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=85.8s	85.8	 you're here so I'm pointed out to him. Now I'm going to close the door since he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=91.1s	91.1	 pretty comfortable. You're gonna be too good and it's gonna make it look too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=103.5s	103.5	 easy. So now just hanging out in the crate. I would throw them in his bed but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=112.7s	112.7	 they're disappearing and you can't see them so I'll just put them on the floor for now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=116.3s	116.3	 Good boy! Now I'm gonna click as I walk slightly away and feed him back away from the gate. I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=127.5s	127.5	 want him to be thinking that when I leave he has to stand right here. So feed back in that area over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=143.4s	143.4	 I'm clicking him for me going in and out, in and out. It's basically like if you had a dog that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=150.3s	150.3	 barks at the door you just keep ringing the doorbell. That's the trigger that makes them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 worried. So the trigger that makes the puppy worried is when the person leaves. So clicking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=161.1s	161.1	 him for leaving, coming back, leaving, coming back. Soon he's like gosh that lady's boring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=165.4s	165.4	 She keeps leaving, coming back. It's no longer interesting. Then you just go away for longer periods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=183.3s	183.3	 The cool thing is that you can mark while you're gone and then reinforce the dog while you're here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 Whereas if you were just to give them food, the only time they get getting reinforcement is when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=194.9s	194.9	 you're actually in the room with them. So then it makes it even worse if you go away. So I'm gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=199.7s	199.7	 open the door just to show him that he could come out if he wanted. But the best place to be is in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=206.5s	206.5	 here. So hopefully he'll try coming out. But I think he's too smart. But nothing happens. All the good things happen in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=225.1s	225.1	 So when he comes out I'm not going to try and stare at him. But when he chooses to go back in there he gets a click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=241.1s	241.1	 I think there was a piece of food in there that he found. Hey boy! It's a jackpot party. Yay!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=249.5s	249.5	 And a lot of dogs get scared by the noise of metal. So you can feed them for all these noises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=259.4s	259.4	 But he's pretty confident. Hey boy! Yeah. So then I could go in there again and just hang out with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=269.2s	269.2	 Show him that it's not a very... it's a really cool place to hang out. You know maybe play with toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=275.0s	275.0	 with him in here and get him interested in like all the things that you're going to leave him alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=279.3s	279.3	 with like his bully stick and his toys. So he knows that they're things that he can entertain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 himself with when you're gone. Also putting Kongs like a Nylabone in here would be great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=290.7s	290.7	 so that he has things to entertain himself with. A nice cushy bed, a toilet, some water, his food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 If he's a very young puppy they might need a little bit of food to last them through the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 Okay. Yeah this is the perfect setup. Okay so now we're going to leave the room. Is it? Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=312.3s	312.3	 Hey boy! He's in the bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=320.7s	320.7	 It helps if you have a mirror.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=327.8s	327.8	 I shot up his butt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=332.7s	332.7	 I'm not looking at him. I'm just throwing the food in. I'm being very nonchalant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=336.8s	336.8	 When I come in this room I... no I can't even... I don't even see the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 I'm going to practice walking in and out again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=362.7s	362.7	 Oh boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=366.5s	366.5	 Oh he's not seeing me through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=373.3s	373.3	 So here I might like just wait until he turns around and does and looks at the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=377.9s	377.9	 There is a possibility he could start whining but at some point he's going to be like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=381.3s	381.3	 oh there are treats back there. I think I'll go check it out. Good boy! Hi!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 Hi!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=396.1s	396.1	 dog's like oh I kind of like being here. Good boy! And you should deliver the treat pretty

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=413.1s	413.1	 I'm actually going to... I'm going to stick some of the cheese inside of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=421.8s	421.8	 the little comb thing so we can try and get it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=438.1s	438.1	 Now he has a little puzzle to work on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=443.1s	443.1	 That's fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=465.0s	465.0	 And he heard his click he knows what that means so he's coming to get his treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=473.5s	473.5	 Now when he goes when he goes back to the comb I'm actually going to open the door so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=478.9s	478.9	 he can come out if he wants to but not while he's looking at the gate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=489.7s	489.7	 So I'm just going to wait till he goes back over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=493.8s	493.8	 Then I'm going to open the door and then one thing you can do is he thinks he wants to come out but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQpIojDLGwQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=517&pp=iAQB&t=498.6s	498.6	 you go in just as you open the door and that way they're not they're not like let me out let me
