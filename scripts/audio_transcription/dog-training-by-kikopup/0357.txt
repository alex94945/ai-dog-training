https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I've been asked by fellow dog trainers to participate in the World Dog Trainers Transparency Challenge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 I have to answer three questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 What happens when the dog gets it right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 What happens when the dog gets it wrong?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 And is there any less intrusive way to train?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Now, my answer to what happens when the dog gets it right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 I'm assuming that means when the dog offers the correct response or desirable behavior in training sessions or in everyday life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 Either the dog gets nothing because the behavior has been highly reinforced and is on a variable ratio of reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 So right now they're doing a really lovely group settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 I'm not always going to give them a treat, but if I want to reinforce that behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 I'm going to use either food. For something calm, I'll use food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 For something excitable, I'll use toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 And I also love, especially with clients, to use access to the environment and anything that the dog wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 So for walking on a loose leash, for responding to their handler,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 when the handler asks for attention or some behavior like a sit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 the dog can then get to do what they want it to do. So maybe get released into a field to sniff or to get to say hi to a dog or a person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 And by making behavior, making access to the environment contingent on behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 you can get some really reliable, strong behaviors very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 So what happens when the dog gets it wrong?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 I'm going to interpret that to mean that the dog has offered an incorrect response to a cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 or that the dog is simply offering some undesirable behavior that you don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 Well, for me, interrupting is a very big part of my training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 I love to make sure to manage, prevent, and interrupt behaviors that I don't want to see again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 because I don't want them to have a reinforcement history where the dog can regress to doing the behavior again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 Or simply I don't want my dogs to remember their errors in training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 I rather set them up for success so they're practicing just the behavior that I want to get or achieve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 So I have many ways to interrupt behavior, but none of them involve any forms of physical or psychological intimidation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 I don't say the cues to interrupt dogs in a mean or aggressive or intimidating voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 I use a very calm voice and like, for example, leave it or here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 And what I do instead is I train all the interrupted cues as behaviors themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 And then when I use them, they don't get a reward after them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 So I will prove a leave it cue and during the training session the dog's getting rewarded for leaving different scenarios and different distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 But then in a real life scenario, say for example, my dog, my puppy is going to bother my adult dog and I don't want him to anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 I'm going to say leave it. He leaves the dog and I can give him another cue like go to your bed and he can go to his bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 But I'm not going to reinforce with primary or secondary enforcers because I don't want to reinforce the behavior chain of the dog doing the bad behavior first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 So in line with interrupting behaviors, you really have to make sure to reinforce alternate behaviors or the absence of the undesirable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 So that's a big part about what to do when the dog gets it wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 You're going to think and plan and follow out a training plan to teach your dog what you do want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=223.0s	223.0	 Now for my long list of interruptions, I train a positively reinforced attention noise to interrupt behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 A recall, you can use a cue, an alternate cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 For example, if you don't want your dog to go out the door, you can tell the dog to go to their bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 If you have multiple dogs and there's an emergency situation, you can tell them all to go in their own bed or into their own crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 Other ways of interrupting behavior, the leave it cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 I have videos on all of the ones I've talked about so far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 A cue to drop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 Say for example your dog picks something up on the ground while you're on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 A cue to drop what they have, giving them information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 Then leash walking interruptors, giving it to leash pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 And the cue, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=280.0s	280.0	 I have videos on both of those that you can watch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 The point of that is say your dog is lunging and barking, you need to move your dog and prevent that behavior from being reinforced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 But if you haven't trained leash pressure, giving it to leash pressure as a behavior in itself, it can be very stressful, frustrating, and punishing to the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 Instead, we're going to teach the dogs that giving it to the pressure on leash is actually a cue to move with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 And it makes dogs' lives less frustrating and stressful when we teach them what we want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 Okay, so what have I got there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=315.0s	315.0	 Another solution, if you have a tiny little puppy that's chewing on the wall, they don't listen to you, just get the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 Go pick the puppy up and put them in their pen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 You don't want to do it in an intimidating way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 There's no need to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 You want to do it in the most neutral way possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=332.0s	332.0	 Get the puppy, put them in their pen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=334.0s	334.0	 If your puppy was scared of being picked up, that's definitely something you should work on in the future to get your dog to love being handled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 and not at all frightened of any type of grooming or handling behavior like being picked up or checked for fleas or ticks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=351.0s	351.0	 So a big part of what to do when the dog gets it wrong is also teaching dogs coping skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=359.0s	359.0	 So if you're going to need to move your dog on leash or if you're going to need to take your dog to the bed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=365.0s	365.0	 these behaviors of being touched and manipulated are not going to be stressful for the dog because you reinforce them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 Okay, what others?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 I have another way to interrupt undesirable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=381.0s	381.0	 I use a food lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 So in training tricks, if my dog does a behavior I don't like or an incorrect response to a cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 I'll simply whip out the food lure, show them what I want, but not give them the treat, then make criteria easier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=396.0s	396.0	 and usually the dog will succeed very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=399.0s	399.0	 An example of this is a down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 I sit down, the dog stays, and then they get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 I'm going to quickly rush over there, not in an intimidating manner,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=408.0s	408.0	 lure the dog back into the down position and then make the distraction a little bit easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=413.0s	413.0	 And then there's the obvious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 If you think your dog hasn't heard the cue properly, you can try saying the cue again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=421.0s	421.0	 If you know your dog is reliable with the behavior and they were just distracted by a noise or a big truck went by right as you said the cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=429.0s	429.0	 obviously maybe they didn't hear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=431.0s	431.0	 But I would say if your dog doesn't respond more than two times, it's obvious there's a problem that you need to solve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=438.0s	438.0	 Also, if it's the same cue that you have to repeat twice, there is definitely a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=443.0s	443.0	 So repeating cues definitely tells you there's something amiss with your training plans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=450.0s	450.0	 Question number three. Are there any less intrusive ways to train dogs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=456.0s	456.0	 Now a lot of my friends and colleagues have been answering no, not that I know of, or otherwise I'd be training that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=462.0s	462.0	 And I totally believe that's a correct answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=465.0s	465.0	 However, just for fun, I'm going to say yes, there are less intrusive ways to train.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=470.0s	470.0	 And what do I mean by that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 Well, when I look back at footage of myself training three or four years ago,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=477.0s	477.0	 I see that I personally think that I've improved to make my training more reliable, less stressful for the dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=483.0s	483.0	 and less frustrating because my observation skills have increased, my timing, rate, and criteria skills have increased,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=491.0s	491.0	 and I hope in the future that I won't still be training the same that I am now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=498.0s	498.0	 I would like to continue to get better and better.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=544.0s	544.0	 and now that I've talked about it, I have to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=547.0s	547.0	 Tug Miterio doesn't really like handling very much, so I need to work on handling more with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=555.0s	555.0	 Other things, splash in very social environments,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=587.0s	587.0	 She's been doing really good, but obviously there's always more you can do,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=619.0s	619.0	 rather than just being like, oh, I'll do that some other time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=358&pp=iAQB&t=623.0s	623.0	 Okay, well, I'm not going to nominate other people to make a video like this.
