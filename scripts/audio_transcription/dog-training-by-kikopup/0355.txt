https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 plan to make that I find the most important.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 And one of those topics that I find the most important is preventing resource guarding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=12.8s	12.8	 in young puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=14.5s	14.5	 This video is an exercise to play with young puppies to prevent toy guarding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 Now I'm going to continue to make videos of different exercises to prevent resource
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=23.9s	23.9	 guarding in young puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=25.9s	25.9	 These exercises are not meant as a plan for a puppy with severe fear issues and severe

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=32.7s	32.7	 And these are not exercises to play with adult dogs that have severe resource guarding issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=38.6s	38.6	 Because what's needed for these two different topics, severe resource guarding in puppies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=43.2s	43.2	 and adult dogs, is a personal plan for that specific dog, rather than just following the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 Because if you go too fast too quickly, you could actually do more damage than good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=55.2s	55.2	 So what you need to do is find a professional dog trainer who uses only positive reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlZmJlllP7Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=356&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 and counter conditioning to solve the problem and get advice to let them help you through
