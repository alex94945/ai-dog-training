https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone! This video is on the topic of tips for trainers who are working with dogs who are showing signs of shyness,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 fearfulness, aggression or reactivity towards human beings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 So in this video I'm going to be giving tips for working with dogs like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 If you're working with your own dog, it's a great idea to get help from a professional trainer that doesn't use any forms of physical or psychological intimidation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 I'm going to demo with my dog Splash here who is very comfortable, but this way I can talk to you and show you some tips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 So the first tip is about movement towards or away from the dog, which I've mentioned in a lot of my videos,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 is that naturally dogs tend to find movement towards them intimidating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 So being conscious of this when first interacting with the dog can really help build the dog's positive association with you from the start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 So I see in a lot of videos where people try to show what the dog looks like before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 you'll notice if you watch some videos of other trainers or on TV where they want to show the dog looking reactive or aggressive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 the dog is just responding to stimuli in the environment and what they're responding to is something that they find threatening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 So ways people can threaten dogs is a direct approach like this, hi buddy, and leaning over the dog or reaching towards the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 So if you wanted to scare a dog, you would walk towards them and get right in their space with a direct stare.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 So instead of just trying to get the dog to be comfortable with what people normally do to dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 which is to lean over them, get in their face and do things that dogs find highly intimidating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 you can build your relationship with the dog in steps and that way their dog is not rehearsing the undesirable behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 and the emotions of feeling conflicted, fearful or not trusting you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 Instead of trying to figure out what's wrong with the dog by seeing it, by getting the dog to do it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 that's going to ruin your relationship right from the start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 What you can do if you're using positive reinforcement training or counter conditioning to work with the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 is that you'll find out what the dog's issues are as you proceed because if you've done certain tests to see how comfortable a dog is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 you'll notice that they start to become a little bit reserved or they offer you a direct stare or they shy away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 and that information is going to tell you, oh, that tiny mini step is too hard for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 But when trying too much too quickly, you're going to get the full on reaction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 So we don't even need a dog to react to know what their issues are because as you go slowly step by step,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 you'll find the issues but in a very minimal way where the dog is under threshold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 And I find that really helpful to prevent the dog rehearsing the emotions and the behaviors that we never want to see again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 because even if they happen and the trainer uses punishment and punishes the behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 behaviors are more likely to happen if they were rehearsed than if they never happened again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 So the way that I train and a lot of people who don't use punishment to work with behavioral issues train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 is that they're trying to create a behavioral plan, that training plan that is going to prevent the dog ever doing the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 or feeling those emotions ever again during the training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 Sure, you might have a setback, but it's going to be a mild setback
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 compared to what the original behavior might have looked like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 It's important to understand that the reinforcement you have might not be very reinforcing in a situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 where the dog feels stressed by your social presence in their environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=242.0s	242.0	 And so the food will have less value as well as your movement towards the dog could be aversive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 or create a negative emotional response in the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 So their positive emotional response to eating a treat and going, yay, that was good,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 might be less intense than their feeling of a negative emotional response of your approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 So even though the dog is sitting there and you move into their space and give them the treat and they eat it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 it doesn't necessarily mean that that has changed their emotional response to you in the best way possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=280.0s	280.0	 Instead, I suggest beginning the training by making it easier for the dog to have that positive emotional response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 So with some dogs, I would suggest that when you're first meeting them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=293.0s	293.0	 they're far away and their owner can be reinforcing the dog for calmly looking at you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 without doing anything like pulling on the leash and moving towards you as you move away from the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 And then also I have another game where as a trainer, you're slowly going and dropping a treat for the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 and then pointing to it and then the owner can walk with their dog on leash far behind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 catch up and point out the treats that you've dropped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=322.0s	322.0	 Get it, splash, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 So the dog is approaching you as you move away in a non-threatening way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=330.0s	330.0	 Here you can see I'm working with Penny, a recently adopted dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=334.0s	334.0	 on building her confidence when guests come over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 Instead of entering her house and trying to build a relationship by moving towards her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 I am meeting outside on the street and reinforcing her for following me and building her motivation to want to move towards me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=350.0s	350.0	 You can see that she doesn't look shy at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 In fact, she's pulling on leash and wagging her tail trying to get to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 When I go into Penny's house, I'm going in before her, not as any sort of dominance game,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=363.0s	363.0	 but because she's following my movement and is motivated to come towards me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=368.0s	368.0	 rather than her being inside her house and me as a guest coming into her space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 Also, when you get to the point where you're able to give the dog treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 I suggest first having the owner do what they do when they're giving the dog treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 because they might do something extremely different than what you're used to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 Some owners have never thrown a treat for their dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 so if you're doing this gesture, it could be very scary to a dog at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 So you might begin with, at a distance, dropping a treat on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=403.0s	403.0	 if you think the dog is uncomfortable with any sort of gesture of being fed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 Another thing to understand with feeding a dog a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=412.0s	412.0	 do you see how every time I feed her I'm moving into her space?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 You can feed dogs treats without making any movement into your dog's space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=421.0s	421.0	 So if you think about it, she has a circle around her of the distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=426.0s	426.0	 This is the distance away from the dog that I'm at right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=429.0s	429.0	 So if I reach like this or like this, it's still going into her space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=434.0s	434.0	 But if I reach here, she's going over here to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=440.0s	440.0	 But my body is closer to her than it was over there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=444.0s	444.0	 so she might feel more uncomfortable even though the treat is further away from her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=449.0s	449.0	 she's having to pass by my body and that might make her uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=454.0s	454.0	 So you have to think all the time of how far away the dog is going to be from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=460.0s	460.0	 So if I reach out like this, get it, then she's just as far away from my body as she was over there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=466.0s	466.0	 and I'm not facing right into her. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=470.0s	470.0	 I can also avert my eyes and move away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=473.0s	473.0	 Another thing that's extremely important to think about is your movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=479.0s	479.0	 Movement toward the dog can be threatening, but also stillness for some dogs can be threatening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=487.0s	487.0	 because dogs will on certain occasions become very still if they're threatening another dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 say if they're guarding something or if they want another dog to go away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=497.0s	497.0	 or to let the other dog know that they're about to start a fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=501.0s	501.0	 So some dogs are not scared of stillness, like perhaps a little shy Italian greyhound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 If you got really still like this, like you bent down and then got really still,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=514.0s	514.0	 the dog might come over and feel very comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=517.0s	517.0	 But for another dog, like border collies and herding breeds, stillness can be very freaky for dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=524.0s	524.0	 especially facing on stillness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=526.0s	526.0	 Say you're in the park and someone stops and stands to stare at you like a kid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=530.0s	530.0	 that's going to freak the dog out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=532.0s	532.0	 But also if someone just crouches down, it's going to be freaky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=536.0s	536.0	 And if you start to think about it, all the things that freak dogs out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=540.0s	540.0	 are the same things that would freak us out if we were in a dark alley and someone did that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=544.0s	544.0	 Now imagine if someone just squatted down as you were walking by and got really still,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=551.0s	551.0	 that would scare you and it could scare a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=555.0s	555.0	 If you're going to be using stillness with a dog that you're training to trust you and feel comfortable in your presence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=562.0s	562.0	 I suggest doing slow movements, very predictable slow movements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=568.0s	568.0	 And lots of dogs have already had experience with taking treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=572.0s	572.0	 So one of the things that I do so that I'm not a creepy still person is mess with my treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=578.0s	578.0	 So I'm either breaking the treats up like this, if I'm standing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=582.0s	582.0	 and then I will slowly be shifting my balance and looking from side to side and blinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=588.0s	588.0	 so that I'm not looking like I'm threatening the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=591.0s	591.0	 I can also lick my lips when I'm going to be looking around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=595.0s	595.0	 And then if I need to look at the dog or turn my direction, I'm not going to stare at the dog like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=601.0s	601.0	 I'm going to dip my head down and avoid the dog with my eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=607.0s	607.0	 So I could go up into the air over the dog or I could go down like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=611.0s	611.0	 And I can check out what the dog's doing without actually having to even look at the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=617.0s	617.0	 So if I really need to see what's going on, I can look forward and then look slightly out of my eye,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=624.0s	624.0	 but then look up so that the dog doesn't think that I'm taking little glances at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=629.0s	629.0	 So what I'm doing here is shifting my weight to one side, looking at my treats, looking around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=636.0s	636.0	 I could even pretend to eat them if the dog is interested in people eating food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=641.0s	641.0	 So it looks like I'm very engaged in my own activity and I have no interest in the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=647.0s	647.0	 And the dog is going to start to want to be interested in what I have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=651.0s	651.0	 So I have shifted my weight to the side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=653.0s	653.0	 Maybe I'll turn around a little bit if the dog is far enough away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=657.0s	657.0	 But if the dog was right next to me, I might just stay very still, but still slightly moving with what I'm doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=665.0s	665.0	 And if I was down on the ground, I would also be engaged in the environment and what I'm doing so that the dog is feeling comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=676.0s	676.0	 If I was going to give the dog a treat, I've been giving the dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=680.0s	680.0	 This dog, she's comfortable with any sort of treat delivery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=685.0s	685.0	 If I was going to give the dog a treat, I have to assess how the owner gives the dog a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=689.0s	689.0	 and mimic how they might give the dog a treat and slow it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=693.0s	693.0	 If the dog is very familiar with toss treats, tossing treats might be more comfortable for the dog than the dropping of the treat or moving to give the dog a treat like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=704.0s	704.0	 But if a dog is very comfortable with the treat delivery of the hen, that might be less scary to them than a tossed treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=712.0s	712.0	 And of course, you need a trainer to help you with this so that you don't, if you can't read dog's body language,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=719.0s	719.0	 that you don't put yourself in a situation where you might get bitten by a dog when working with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=725.0s	725.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=726.0s	726.0	 So the different treat deliveries are walking and dropping a treat like this with the dog at a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=733.0s	733.0	 And the owner can point out the treats to the dog or having the dog follow you if the dog is comfortable with getting this close to you while you're moving around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=742.0s	742.0	 And then also you can feed like that where the dog is getting the treat from the back of your hand like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=749.0s	749.0	 Awesome. And then to the side like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=753.0s	753.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=756.0s	756.0	 And then from the front, if the dog wants to get in front of you, they can and you might start switching hands like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=764.0s	764.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=766.0s	766.0	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=770.0s	770.0	 If you are going to bend over and feed the dog a treat, I suggest bending your knees rather than leaning to reach the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=778.0s	778.0	 So this is you can do later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=780.0s	780.0	 But at first you might lean into the dog to give them the treat like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=784.0s	784.0	 So your knees are bending and you're giving the dog a treat like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=787.0s	787.0	 Another thing that's extremely important to remember is that if you've been still in the same spot with your feet glued because the dog is worried about movement of your body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=797.0s	797.0	 if you've been in the same spot for a long period of time and the dog is very relaxed and they've been in the same spot for a long period of time in the same position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=806.0s	806.0	 and you suddenly move to the side or even away that can startle the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=811.0s	811.0	 And so if you were working with a dog and you wanted to end the session, you could have the owner call the dog away and even put the dog away so that you can leave the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=821.0s	821.0	 and perhaps give the owner some notes or talk to them where you can pay 100 percent of your time to the owner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=829.0s	829.0	 So that way the dog doesn't end the training session being startled by your movement out the door, especially if you're sitting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=838.0s	838.0	 So if you have guests and you're working with your own dog, with a trainer or the trainer themselves and they've sat in a chair, they should tell you when they're about to get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=850.0s	850.0	 So if the dog is sitting, if you're sitting in the chair and this dog is really comfortable with you and then suddenly you move straight up into the air,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=858.0s	858.0	 people stand up super fast and it can be very startling to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=863.0s	863.0	 So they can be very comfortable with guests and as soon as guests stand up to go to the bathroom, that's when dogs freak out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=868.0s	868.0	 So when working with a trainer or guests or helpers, you always want to tell them to not get up until you say when and you can call your dog away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=879.0s	879.0	 So I suggest if you're working with guests or helpers that you keep your training sessions short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=885.0s	885.0	 You have the dog, you reinforce the dog for feeling calm and confident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=890.0s	890.0	 And then you always call the dog away to a distance before the person gets up to move to begin with because that can really set your training to go backwards rather than forwards when people suddenly get up and dogs start to not want to go near people or feel threatened by them because they suddenly move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=909.0s	909.0	 You can also work on all the different triggers that cause the dog to feel scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=916.0s	916.0	 But I suggest first building a trusting relationship and then slowly using counter conditioning to teach the dog to not be scared of these different movements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=926.0s	926.0	 So as you see, she's laying down like that. I'm going to squat and feed the treat to her like that rather than lean over her like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=935.0s	935.0	 And so if the dog was scared of people sitting down and getting up, you could have your dog at a distance and people could slowly stand and get up from chairs first very repetitively so that it's a predictable movement and then do it faster where it's repetitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=951.0s	951.0	 And the dog is getting a treat at a distance from for feeling comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=955.0s	955.0	 And then with more time in between. So the person sitting and then they stand up and the dog gets a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=961.0s	961.0	 But I suggest first building a really positive relationship where you do very predictable movements that are non threatening to the dog before you begin working on these aspects that can be startling to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=977.0s	977.0	 Another thing that you can do is switch so that when you want to work on these movements and the dog has a very trusting relationship already with their owner is that you can feed the dog for watching the owner stand up and sit down and do all the things that that they have an issue with during the training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=997.0s	997.0	 When working with a dog to build their trust in you, what I like to do is make sure that the angle that I'm facing is not a direct frontal angle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1006.0s	1006.0	 So right here it's a straight line and here I'm angled away so I could be asking the dog to do something and I don't have to directly stare at the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1015.0s	1015.0	 So what we normally want to do is kind of lean over and stare at the dog from above with straight shoulders or like this where we're leaning into the dog space so you can angle yourself away and then work with the dog at an angle like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1031.0s	1031.0	 And you'll find that as the dog gets more confident, they're going to line up in front of you like they do with their owner, but they might actually prefer to stay at this side angle to begin with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1042.0s	1042.0	 Also direct when you're thinking about your eye contact you can think of that same thing that if your eyes are facing at the dog in a straight line, that's going to be less comfortable than if the eyes are moving around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1055.0s	1055.0	 And if you were having a conversation with someone and they stared at you the whole time because they're watching your behavior if you're a dog trainer, that's very uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1065.0s	1065.0	 Where if you're having a conversation with someone and they're talking to you and then they look around, they could look a little bit disinterested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 But if they were trying to make a point with you and they stare at you directly, it's much more comfortable if they're also blinking their eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1081.0s	1081.0	 So we can do the same with dogs. If you were to look at them, you can blink the moment your eyes make contact with each other at first and look away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1090.0s	1090.0	 And this is really going to help the dog feel safe with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1095.0s	1095.0	 So basically you can have the most amazing behavior modification plan on paper.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1099.0s	1099.0	 But if you're not conscious of your own body's movement and orientation in relation to the dog, that can really make or break your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1110.0s	1110.0	 And to set the dog up for the most powerful conditioning and the most powerful behavior change, it's a good idea to be conscious about what you're doing and set criteria appropriately and know what the dog is finding comfortable and uncomfortable by being able to understand what threatens dogs and to be able to understand how to read a dog that they are comfortable or uncomfortable with what is going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omuDOadL04&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=157&pp=iAQB&t=1139.0s	1139.0	 Thank you so much for watching. If you'd like to support my work, don't forget to like, comment and subscribe to my channel.
