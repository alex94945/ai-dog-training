https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, this video is on the topic of taking your puppy or adult dog out somewhere new and setting your dog up for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=7.7s	7.7	 If they typically can be a little bit worried or over excited when they go somewhere new now epic here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=14.8s	14.8	 My little puppy is actually really good in lots of different environments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 But I haven't always had puppies like her and so I usually set dogs up for success in this way when going new places
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=25.7s	25.7	 Now previously before I took her here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 I have worked very religiously on reinforcing her for settling inside of her crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=34.4s	34.4	 Like this as well as if you had a larger dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=37.5s	37.5	 You can teach them to relax on a mat like she's doing here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=41.9s	41.9	 And so when you go to a new environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=44.5s	44.5	 You can bring your crate if you have a little dog or a mat if you have a bigger dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=49.7s	49.7	 And if you have a bigger dog, you can also simply park somewhere new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=54.2s	54.2	 Open the back door and have your dog in a crate and just sprinkle some treats in there and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=59.3s	59.3	 Reinforce your dog for settling in the crate in a new environment while they're still inside the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=65.4s	65.4	 Now if you don't work on the subtle in the crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=68.5s	68.5	 At home say when your car is parked or when you have the crate inside your house and your yard in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 Non-distracting environments first then it can be quite stressful for the dog and they might not think to settle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=80.9s	80.9	 So the really important part of the homework here is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=85.7s	85.7	 Reinforcing settling behaviors at home first so you can bring that calmness to other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 Environments the same with if you wanted to teach your dog to sit you would work on that in your house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 Maybe your kitchen your living room and then when the dogs really good at it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=101.4s	101.4	 Then you could start asking for it out and about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 But if you try to teach sit when your dog's stressed or excited and not taking treats out and about they're not going to learn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=110.3s	110.3	 how to sit so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 That's the beauty of working on these behaviors at home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 You can then bring the mat and it's going to help your dog think to relax in a new place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=122.5s	122.5	 Conversely most people when they get somewhere new they're excited about checking out the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 So they'll set off walking and what can happen is that the dog will pull straight ahead or there's just too much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 Stimulation going on for the dog where if you just relax for a little bit and let the dog just sit and look around at the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=142.1s	142.1	 Environment it can be very helpful to decreasing how excited or worried they are about where they are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=149.7s	149.7	 When your dog first settles in a new environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=152.5s	152.5	 It's natural for the dog to be looking at you for the reinforcement if you've just given them a treat like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=158.3s	158.3	 So the dog is going to be staring up at you to begin with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 Once your dog becomes a pro you don't have to reinforce this and you can wait till your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 Casually relaxing and enjoying the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=170.2s	170.2	 But at first to give your dog a head start if they think to go to their mat and they lay down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 You can reinforce that and make it easier for the dog by giving them a couple of treats for simply going and laying on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=181.7s	181.7	 Their mat then as you progress and your dog is feeling comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=185.9s	185.9	 You can reinforce your dog for noticing things in the environment and not just thinking about the food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 So if you constantly feed your dog for just staring at the treats if you don't have any treats the dog might not think to lay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 Down when you're out and about so what you're going to do is wait for those moments that the dog is looking around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=204.1s	204.1	 At something in the environment and that's when you can use a calm marker or simply just put a treat calmly between your dog's feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=212.7s	212.7	 like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=214.5s	214.5	 Basically, I'm waiting for her to be distracted by the environments and look around and then that's the moment that I'm gonna mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=221.7s	221.7	 and it's a little chilly here today in San Diego, so she's shivering a little bit and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=227.9s	227.9	 Previously when we've done this exercise in the Sun, she's much more comfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=231.9s	231.9	 So with her I wouldn't necessarily be out and about sitting when it's kind of cold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=236.9s	236.9	 I would choose a time where it's sunny and warm for her to relax on her mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=242.6s	242.6	 And if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=245.1s	245.1	 If I wanted to do this exercise I could have her in a sweater
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=248.4s	248.4	 So now she's noticed another dog walking by and I'm gonna reinforce her for simply watching the dog pass calmly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=256.1s	256.1	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=268.4s	268.4	 Good well, thank you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=272.5s	272.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=278.3s	278.3	 Good and now a skateboarders going by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=282.5s	282.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=283.9s	283.9	 if your dog's not taking treats you can sprinkle the treats in the crate or on the mat and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=289.7s	289.7	 Limit the leash so that at some point your dog is going to realize there's not very much things to do in this environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=296.7s	296.7	 Except eat the treats and they might be more interested in the treats later
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=300.5s	300.5	 You want to refrain from trying to get your dog to eat the treats and putting the treats in your dog's face if they're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=306.8s	306.8	 Interested just put the treats on the mat or in the crate like you do at home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=310.7s	310.7	 And at some point the dog might think to go and eat those treats and that's a wonderful sign that they're feeling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=317.1s	317.1	 Calmer in that environment if your dog is really struggling and they can't take treats and they start whining or seeming stressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=323.7s	323.7	 You can go and practice this exercise in front of your house or in your yard or at home at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=328.9s	328.9	 Or simply try the exercise where you have the dog in the car and are working on the settle in the crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=335.7s	335.7	 If you have a dog that gets worried or excited in new locations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=339.4s	339.4	 You can choose a location that you think your dog is going to do best at to begin this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=344.9s	344.9	 So for example if your dog gets overwhelmed in crowded situations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=349.1s	349.1	 You might choose a place where say for example a baseball field that no one's visiting where it's completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=355.8s	355.8	 Isolated to work on this exercise first before then visiting another location perhaps during the middle of the day when everyone's at work and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=364.1s	364.1	 there are few people there or a place that not very many people go to to begin this exercise however
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=370.9s	370.9	 I have to say if you have a herding breed or a dog that gets startled when there's nothing going on in the environment and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 Suddenly someone or a person with a dog come out of the blue that can be very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=384.3s	384.3	 Startling to some dogs so choosing a location for example the edge of a parking lot or some grass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=391.9s	391.9	 You know in a mall that overlooks an area where there's some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=396.3s	396.3	 Foot traffic that's going back and forth on a path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=399.1s	399.1	 Then your dog is seeing an ebb and flow of people going by and they can relax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=404.0s	404.0	 Seeing multiple people moving rather than nothing and then suddenly a person appearing out of nowhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=409.8s	409.8	 So this might be too close for some dogs, but we're sitting next to a pathway that people walk up and down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=417.9s	417.9	 So if you had a dog that was nervous you could sit further away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=421.0s	421.0	 And then reinforce your dog for the people walking back and forth on this path, and I chose a pretty busy time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=428.5s	428.5	 Where there's lots of traffic going back and forth cars and people my little puppy has finished her puppy shots
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=435.9s	435.9	 So it's perfectly fine for her to go sniffing around in different locations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=439.9s	439.9	 But if you're concerned that your puppy hasn't finished their shots yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=443.4s	443.4	 And you're not sure about the area that there might have been dogs visiting the area that could have had diseases or illnesses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=450.5s	450.5	 What you can do is visit somewhere and bring a large sheet or blanket
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=455.1s	455.1	 Something even bigger than this if you want and then just limit your dog's leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=458.9s	458.9	 So that they can't reach the edges of the blanket or the sheet and you can reinforce your dog for looking around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=465.9s	465.9	 at the world and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=467.6s	467.6	 Socializing your dog to what it's like being out and about you can also use a baby carriage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=474.0s	474.0	 To bring your dog on outings as well as carry your dog in a bag or a backpack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=479.2s	479.2	 So they're seeing the world and getting reinforced and feeling safe when out and about as they're in that very important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=487.5s	487.5	 socialization period
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=489.2s	489.2	 The wonderful thing about having a dog in a carrier or in a baby carriage is that the other dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=495.1s	495.1	 Don't pull and stare at your puppy and they can build a lot of confidence if they're a little bit worried about dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=502.3s	502.3	 Once your dog is successful with settling in this environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=505.6s	505.6	 You can then take little adventures away from the mat and then return to calm your dog down again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=511.7s	511.7	 So you can either do calm sniffy walks where you allow your dog or puppy to explore the environment or you can work on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=519.2s	519.2	 Exercises such as loose leash walking or strong behaviors. They already know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=523.7s	523.7	 I don't suggest working on something new or adding criteria to any of your behaviors in a new environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=530.0s	530.0	 Instead you want to ask your dog for behaviors that are really strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=533.4s	533.4	 so I like to ask for behaviors that I've worked on a lot such as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=538.2s	538.2	 Attention and the attention game recalls are also great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=542.6s	542.6	 But if you're trying to get the get your dog to be calm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=546.6s	546.6	 Maybe I would work on something else besides an exciting behavior like a recall. Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=552.4s	552.4	 So I'm gonna go on a little sniffy walk and let her investigate the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=557.3s	557.3	 so I'm gonna say let's go and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=559.5s	559.5	 Call her off the blanket and I'm just gonna get this leash out from under her leg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=563.8s	563.8	 whoop and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=565.1s	565.1	 Then let her sniff around so you can have a cue for your dog to explore the environment like go sniff and point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=572.3s	572.3	 If you have a dog that's more interested at staring at you or the treats you can mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=579.3s	579.3	 for your dog sniffing around and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=581.6s	581.6	 Conversely if your dog sniffs around a lot and finds it highly reinforcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=585.3s	585.3	 You can reinforce your dog for coming away from the smells and back to you when you say let's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=592.3s	592.3	 Good so if your dog is sniffing around that's the time that you can mark and reinforce your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=598.3s	598.3	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=600.3s	600.3	 For walking on a loose leash and not just staring up at you and hoping for the treats to come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=605.9s	605.9	 because if you just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=607.9s	607.9	 Reinforce your dog for looking at you as you walk around if you don't have treats or your dogs not looking up at you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=614.3s	614.3	 Your dog might think to start pulling on leash and not understand the concept of walking next to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=619.5s	619.5	 If you're not in training mode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=621.5s	621.5	 However, if you're working on exercises where your dog is at your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=625.5s	625.5	 And you're using a marker word a high rate of reinforcement or a clicker like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=629.5s	629.5	 It's great if your dog is looking up because they're waiting to see what you want next and that's perfectly fine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=635.5s	635.5	 Are you ready epic? So we're gonna practice a little walk away and I'm gonna mark and reinforce her for walking at my side like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=643.5s	643.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=645.5s	645.5	 As well as stopping when I stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=649.5s	649.5	 Let's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=651.5s	651.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=653.5s	653.5	 And she's gonna be looking up at me or looking towards the mat that she's then gonna relax on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=659.5s	659.5	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=663.5s	663.5	 Let's go and the difference is that you see she's got her head faced forwards in a natural position and I can reinforce that on a normal walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=673.5s	673.5	 So when we walk around and she's just enjoying the environment I can reinforce her and I can feed her in the direction that her head is facing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=681.5s	681.5	 If you're out and about and you have treats and your dog is hyper fixated on your treats you can give your dog a treat like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=691.5s	691.5	 And then show your dog you have nothing and say all done and then go sniff epic go sniff and then wait until your dog is invested in sniffing in the grass like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=703.5s	703.5	 Good and then you can mark and reinforce so your dog is understanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=707.5s	707.5	 Good that by not paying attention to you is how they're gonna get the treat in this type of situation so that then you can walk around and have your dog explore the environment without them hyper fixating on you and the treats and when the treats are not there that they completely ignore you completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=725.5s	725.5	 So that's what I like to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=727.5s	727.5	 So that's what I like to do in the same way that you would reinforce your dog when settling for looking around at the environment you can do the same when the dog standing still like this or when you're walking so as I'm talking to you I have a treat in one of my hands ready to give my dog good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=743.5s	743.5	 And then the moment that she checks out and she starts looking around at the environment or as we're walking and she's sniffing good I can mark and reinforce so I don't get that constant staring at me which if you have a young puppy they're not going to be looking around at the environment and learning what the environment looks like because they're just staring at you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=764.5s	764.5	 So I find it extremely important for building confidence that the puppy is also getting time to look around explore and sniff if you're planning on training your puppy or adult dog went out and about I first suggest warming up with the attention game or really easy behaviors that are your dog's strongest behaviors because if your dog isn't able to do just these simple things then it's not a good idea to work on harder behaviors or add criteria or teach something new to your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=794.5s	794.5	 So as you can see she's looking straight up at me and looking for the treat another test that you can do is mark with a clicker and if your dog doesn't look for the treat or look when you say good or yes look for their reinforcement that tells you that in this environment at this point in time the reinforcement isn't very strong or isn't reinforcing at all to the dog because the environment is too stressful or arousing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=824.5s	824.5	 So I have a video on how to train the attention game and I'm going to link that in the description below but here's just a quick example I'm going to put a treat down like this and then I'm going to make a kissy noise and mark and reinforce when my dog comes towards me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=842.5s	842.5	 Putting the treat down in the grass gives you some time to get further away from your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=846.5s	846.5	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=849.5s	849.5	 If your dog is highly distracted by things in the environment such as things in the grass, maybe rabbit poop, trash, or dogs or people walking around and your dog is hyper fixated on those things sometimes playing the leash pressure game away from a distraction can focus your dog in on one specific distraction to concentrate about and it can be much easier for the dog to start to pay attention to you worrying about that specific thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=876.5s	876.5	 So I'll link a video in the description below on how to work on the leash pressure game but I suggest trying it out and about if you have a dog that gets distracted by things in the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=893.5s	893.5	 So basically I'm going to put a treat down out of reach from her over here and then I'm going to mark the moment that she turns back towards me and we've played this game before so first you're marking the moment that your dog turns towards you when they feel the pressure on the leash and then you're marking and reinforcing your dog for staying with you with the goal of the dog completely ignoring the food on the ground and it's cueing the dog for default attention on you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=924.5s	924.5	 After playing this game a little bit to warm up you could then work on the behaviors that you wish to work on with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=931.5s	931.5	 Here's some footage of me working on a leave it game when out and about with my puppy Halo. I've set up little blocks of cheese on this windowsill and at first I'm giving him a verbal cue to leave the cheese and then next I'm marking and reinforcing him for doing a default leave it past the cheese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=950.5s	950.5	 Let's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=951.5s	951.5	 Here's some footage of me working with Epic instead of going on a snippy walk away from settling in the crate we're practicing walking at my side and turning when I go in another direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=970.5s	970.5	 Let's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPot4pauBk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=163&pp=iAQB&t=971.5s	971.5	 Good
