https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgnLgHFRJu4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=541&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 The point of this exercise is to condition the dog to love these items even before they

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgnLgHFRJu4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=541&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 The most important concept behind this exercise is that the dog finds the person who is putting
