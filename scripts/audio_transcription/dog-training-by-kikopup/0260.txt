https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everyone, today's video is for those of you who have just got a rescue dog or puppy and you're trying to teach your dog to lay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=7.4s	7.4	 down using a piece of food as a lure and it's just not working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 So here are some things that you can do. One thing is teaching your dog to crawl underneath something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=17.6s	17.6	 So you can either use your leg like this and you're gonna hold a treat under your leg and you're just gonna click your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 for going under your leg like that. Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=27.2s	27.2	 So any type of crouching motion. Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 Then you can start to lower your leg as your dog is going through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=36.6s	36.6	 And click as your dog starts to go into the down position like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=41.6s	41.6	 Click and feed your dog for staying in that position and then you could add a release cue like free and invite your dog up with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 Now you can try to turn this into a hand signal. So hold the treats above your leg and then move your hand under your leg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 and as your dog lays down, click and feed. Now you're gonna try and do this without your leg involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 You might need to do this a couple of training sessions before your dog learns that when you put your hand down on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=79.4s	79.4	 that it means to lay down without your leg being there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 Good! Free!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=93.4s	93.4	 Once your dog is reliably laying down when you put the treat down on the ground,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=97.4s	97.4	 you can see your cue down just before you go to move your hand to put your treat down on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=104.8s	104.8	 If you're uncomfortable luring your dog underneath your body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 you can use something around the house like a table or a chair that your dog can just walk underneath at first to have your dog go under.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 So here I'm just gonna have to go under this table like this using a high rate of reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 and I'm luring him under this table and then once he's got that down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=125.8s	125.8	 I'm gonna use something where he has to lay down in order to go underneath of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=131.2s	131.2	 This chair is much lower so he's gonna have to go into the down position in order to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 Are you ready? Get it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=138.2s	138.2	 Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=142.2s	142.2	 Good boy! Free!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=153.2s	153.2	 Free!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=155.2s	155.2	 Once your dog understands that when the treat in your hand is on the ground it means to lay down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 you can try luring your dog into the down without the prop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 So you're gonna hold the treat in front of your dog's nose and you're gonna push it slightly at an angle towards your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 and click as your dog lays down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 Now if your dog doesn't lay down immediately, you can practice something else free,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 which is to just click a slight movement into the down position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 Here are a couple of reasons why dogs might not want to lay down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=183.6s	183.6	 One, they don't understand what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 Two, they don't find what you have reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 Three, they might feel intimidated or worried about something in the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 I mean as human beings if you're walking down a scary street at night,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 the last thing you're thinking about is laying down on the street in the scary street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 So dogs are the same and if you take them into an environment that they're a little bit worried,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 then they're not gonna want to lay down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 For example, a class environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 So don't worry about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=213.4s	213.4	 Another reason that dogs might not want to lay down is that the floor surface is slippery,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=218.4s	218.4	 so they're worried about slipping as they go into the down position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=221.4s	221.4	 So I suggest if you want to take your dog somewhere to practice doing a down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 bring a non-slip mat with you or practice on grass or another non-slip surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 Another reason why dogs might not want to lay down is that they might be hurt or injured.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=236.4s	236.4	 Some dogs with hip dysplasia or they're having some pain in their body or their wrists,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=241.8s	241.8	 they might refuse to lay down even with a treat lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=244.8s	244.8	 So if you've tried all these different things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 these exercises that I've just shown you at home and for some reason your dog never seems to lay down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=252.8s	252.8	 except when he goes to bed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=254.8s	254.8	 I suggest going and checking with a vet to make sure there isn't something going on with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=258.8s	258.8	 But as a last resort, if none of these techniques are working,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=262.8s	262.8	 what you can do is watch your dog throughout the day and anytime you do see your dog lay down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 make a big deal about it, be like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=270.2s	270.2	 yay, good boy and go and run and get him some treats and sprinkle some treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=275.2s	275.2	 so he's starting to lay down more and more throughout the day and you're reinforcing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=279.2s	279.2	 and that is going to help the training of him laying down to be easier and easier in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=284.2s	284.2	 I hope this video was helpful for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G9_vdOFjjE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=261&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe to my channel to show your support.
