https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I'm eating some delicious yakisoba, but I need a drink, so I'm going to go in the kitchen and get one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 Leave it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 And, uh, you can't really see that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 Leave it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 Well, thanks guys. That was really nice of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 Default Leave It. If you use food or rewards to train your dog, this is essential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 This same exercise can be used for tugs, toys, or any reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 This is a default Leave It where the dog learns never to do what this dog is doing right now, which is mugging the hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 They're trying to get the treats out of the hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 If they're constantly thinking about the food, they're not going to learn as quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 So, um, instead of going, no, no, bad dog, or going like this, or going, eeeh, wrong, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 I'm going to let the dog try and do what they want to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 So let the dog scratch you, let the dog bite your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 Or, obviously not, if it's really painful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 But the millisecond the dog backs away, they get a click and treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 So they get what they want by not trying to get what they want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 Like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 And for staying back, you don't want to build a behavior chain of mug the hand and then back away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 So treats are happening for not thinking about the food in my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 Even some eye contact might be nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 So I'm asking for eye contact instead of staring at or licking at my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 So the way to get treats is stare at my eyes, not at the food or think about the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 So I'm going to wait Max out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 Hopefully Max will think to look up at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 And now I'm going to put my hand somewhere else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 So we'll make it a different situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 The food is now here, Max is going to try and get it, you know, again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 So dogs don't generalize well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 New situation means try everything again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 So do this a couple times, you know, do a couple sessions of this before they actually get what it means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 Click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 Click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 Okay, so put down a piece of food, have your dog on leash, and let them try everything they want to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 The only behaviors that you're going to reinforce are turning away from the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 So you'll notice I'm clicking the millisecond that Max turns away from the food and looks at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 Click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 Now be sure to click when your dog is looking at you rather than the food in your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 They can be looking at your legs or your eyes, but definitely not, you know, where's that treat my owner's going to give me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 So Max is a six-month-old Chihuahua, and he's never done this exercise before, but he does know what the click means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=223.0s	223.0	 Actually, he's a very shy dog with people, so especially for shy dogs, this is very confidence building.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 And not only that, it improves your relationship with your dog rather than making you seem like the annoying human that ruins their fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 Instead of choosing the food, he is now choosing the handler.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=242.0s	242.0	 By not saying eh-eh or no, the dog is choosing on his own that he prefers not to do the unwanted behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 If you say no or eh-eh, the dog still wants to do the previous behavior, but is worried it might cause his owner to become intimidating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 Look at Max's body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 Attention on me, wagging tail, calm, relaxed, and he's choosing me over the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 So not only is his trust in me building, but so is our relationship.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 Look at the body language of a dog that's been taught leave it using punishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 You'll see ears pinned back, lip licking, yawning, looking away, and the dog basically trying to calm their owner down using calming signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 This way, you'll see the dog confident, happy, and really they are choosing their owner over that distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 Where with punishment, they are forced into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=300.0s	300.0	 So here you can see I'm adding a cue because I am 90% sure that Max is going to leave the bagel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 I would really suggest that you don't add a cue the first session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=310.0s	310.0	 Because if you've said the cue leave it and the dog doesn't and they're still pulling and pulling towards it, you'll be tempted to say leave it again and again and again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=318.0s	318.0	 And that becomes a habit and the dog learns, oh my owner just repeats stuff and it doesn't really mean anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 That is a bagel, a cinnamon bagel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=334.0s	334.0	 Okay, so here is the biscotti and I say, Max leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 And he says I already know this game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=341.0s	341.0	 Leave it, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 Awesome job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 Max leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 I don't like to encourage dogs to sit or lay down to the cue of leave it because for instance if it's a vicious dog you want them to leave or if it's a dead rat you don't really want them laying next to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=359.0s	359.0	 Tortilla on a plate, mind you, would you like to have some tortilla since you're a chihuahua?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 So I'm going to start again with a leash because there's no way I can cover a tortilla.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=371.0s	371.0	 And I'm just going to tell Max leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=382.0s	382.0	 Oh what a good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 I'm clicking him looking back to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=388.0s	388.0	 Oh what a good boy, you're so smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 Come here guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 And these dogs get to eat off of plates so leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=406.0s	406.0	 Who do they look to when they put down food?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 Me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiVmbUiELAw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=596&pp=iAQB&t=418.0s	418.0	 You
