https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 What to do if your dog has a fearful episode while out and about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 Now it really depends on the dog's personality, genetics, and prior learning history as to what you're going to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 I personally really suggest that you go with your gut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 You know your dog best because you live with your dog and you've seen your dog experience different situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 So if someone else is trying to tell you to do something or pressure you to do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 and you really think your dog is not going to be able to handle that situation, then go with your gut.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 An example of this is one time I was out with my dog and a friend and he had never seen sea lions before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 So he was smelling these weird smells and getting kind of weirded out by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 And then he's a really friendly, happy, you're lucky guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 Then he started getting worried like if someone bumped him from behind as they were passing by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 So my friend decided that she would desensitize him to it by touching him repeatedly and he loves her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 So every time she touched him he would startle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 And guess what? He didn't get better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 He got worse and worse and he started getting scared of other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 So in my head I thought no this isn't the right time to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Because he's already like been so many places today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 He's worried about the smells that he's never smelled before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 It's not a good time to try to habituate a dog to something that startled them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 especially if it's something that they used to like before and now they don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 So that's a big warning sign is if especially if it's something that the dog was comfortable with before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 then just what I would say is abort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 Instead of trying to work on it in that exact moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 which a lot of people want to do because they don't want to leave the area with their dog thinking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 oh there's this creepy thing happening in that area and have their dog remember it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 However, if the dog is startling at everything and not feeling very well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 you're just going to make the problem worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 It's like if you were driving down the freeway and some car rear ends you and it startles you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 so getting rear ended multiple times, it isn't going to help you de-stress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 if you're already in that mode where you're worried about stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 You can actually sensitize.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 Some people could habituate, so they keep getting rear ended and then they're okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 So there are some dogs if the situation, if they continue to get petted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 oh they love that and then they realize it's wonderful and they start to relax,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 then that's a perfectly fine thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 But you really have to understand, is your dog going to habituate to the stimulus that's happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 or are they going to sensitize?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 And is the environment a chaotic environment where things that are creepy keep happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 at the same time that you're working on this thing you want your dog to feel comfortable with?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 Then I would definitely not even try it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 Just do it at another time when you're at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 If it's something you can present at home, maybe say it's a person petting your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 or maybe your dog's on an uneven surface like a grate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 like if they walk over a manhole cover and it moves or a bridge,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 you don't have to work on that in the place that scared them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 You can get an uneven surface and work on it at home,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 and then when your dog's comfortable, go somewhere else, work on it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 and then go to the place where the dog had the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 This is really going to set your dog up for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 This idea of trying to get them over their fear right in the moment of their fear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 can backfire where the dog gets more and more anxious and scared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 and starts to lose trust in you because you keep asking them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 to do these things that they don't really want to do in that environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 Their brain is telling them, this is not a safe place, I need to get away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 and as soon as they have that fearful response, you keep bringing them back to that place that they didn't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 So, if you really think your dog isn't going to go like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 oh, it's just rattles a little bit, oh, this is fine, oh, this is easy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 if you think your dog is going to do that, then go ahead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 and you can start working with your dog in that environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 but if you think your dog is having a hard time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 and the possibility is that they're going to sensitize, abort, and work on it at a later date
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 when they're not having those stress hormones in their body from being previously startled,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961R3iC9ZNE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=4&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 then you can start working with your dog in that environment.
