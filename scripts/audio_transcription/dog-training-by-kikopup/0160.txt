https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everybody, this is a two and a half hour video compilation of my favorite training tutorials on how to teach your dog to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8.9s	8.9	 In the description below you'll find a list of the video tutorials and when they appear in this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 I hope you enjoy this compilation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=18.4s	18.4	 Teaching a beginning sit or down stay to a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=23.3s	23.3	 So this is what I would naturally do with a young puppy that hasn't learned any cues or doesn't know how to follow a lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=31.3s	31.3	 Now I would teach the puppy to follow a lure without licking and biting so that you can train behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=38.1s	38.1	 But for position changes if you just got a new puppy one way of getting the behavior is simply feeding your puppy a treat like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=46.1s	46.1	 And drip feeding the puppy a treat to get the puppy into the position of laying down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=52.3s	52.3	 Because if you just try to lure the puppy what can happen is that they're going to lick and bite at the treat in your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 So you can just feed them a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=60.9s	60.9	 So I've got this chicken treat right here and I'm just letting her nibble at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=65.5s	65.5	 And then I'm going to lift the treat up into the sit while she's nibbling like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 If you have a very squirmy puppy this will help them doing a hundred and one things while you move the treat down and back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=81.8s	81.8	 So you're just going to practice your luring skills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=84.3s	84.3	 You don't have to use any marker words or say anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=87.7s	87.7	 So you're just feeding the puppy and practicing getting the different positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=91.8s	91.8	 So to get the stand from the down I'm lifting the treat at a diagonal away from the puppy's body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=99.1s	99.1	 And then when I want the puppy to go back into the down I'm moving the treat back into the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=104.2s	104.2	 And I can put the treat on the ground like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=107.1s	107.1	 So when the puppy's in the down position they're expecting the treat to come from below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=112.5s	112.5	 And that will help from stopping them popping up for the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=117.5s	117.5	 Okay so to go from the down into the sit I'm going to move the treat up like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=122.9s	122.9	 And then back into the down, down and forwards a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 Now you might have to experiment with your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=129.8s	129.8	 And at first when I started training her she wouldn't want to even lay on this carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=134.5s	134.5	 So I used a cushy bed to initially get her to lay in the down position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=142.2s	142.2	 So once your puppy is moving nicely from the different positions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 while nibbling on little bits of treats like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=149.7s	149.7	 then what you're going to do is you're going to start to remove the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=154.1s	154.1	 So I'm going to lure her into the sit position like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 And then I'm going to lift the treat away and bring it back like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=160.8s	160.8	 So as you can see the angle that I'm moving the treat away is keeping her in the sit position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=166.7s	166.7	 If I were just to move my hand like this she might get up to follow my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 And the same with the down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 So once the dog is in the down position I'm going to move the treat forwards away from her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=178.7s	178.7	 rather than up like this because it might encourage her to follow the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=183.1s	183.1	 and get out of the position because she has no idea why she's getting the treats yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 So here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 Into the stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 I'm going to...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 We haven't really worked on the stand at all yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 but once she's in the stand position I'm going to move the treat away like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=197.7s	197.7	 and then bring it back so she doesn't even have time to follow it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=201.5s	201.5	 because it's coming back to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 Once you've gotten to that step you can start to use a clicker or a marker word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=209.7s	209.7	 So you lure the dog into the correct position such as a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=214.3s	214.3	 You can mark, feed, and then you can click as the treat hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=219.2s	219.2	 moves away from the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=221.1s	221.1	 So you're clicking your puppy for staying still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=224.2s	224.2	 Now I saw my puppy's feet move a little bit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 so I want to make sure that I'm getting some nice still feet before I mark and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=239.2s	239.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=241.7s	241.7	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 Free!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=244.4s	244.4	 And then once you're starting to get multiple repetitions of marking and reinforcing the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=249.9s	249.9	 in the position you want to quickly teach the puppy a release cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=254.3s	254.3	 So mine is free and that means you can get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=257.2s	257.2	 So you can say the cue to sit or down if you want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=260.9s	260.9	 If your dog is reliably following the lure into the different positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=265.2s	265.2	 But I would usually add that cue when the dog can stay for at least 10 seconds in the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=271.6s	271.6	 Then you can say down and then mark and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=274.4s	274.4	 But for the release cue because I use it with all the different behaviors that I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=279.1s	279.1	 I'm going to say the cue free and then I'm going to encourage the dog to follow to get the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=285.3s	285.3	 so that it's not confusing that they know when they're staying they shouldn't get the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=290.3s	290.3	 and when they're released that they can get a treat that's moved away from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=294.7s	294.7	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=296.3s	296.3	 So I'm going to lure her into the down position and drop a treat there and move my hand away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=301.5s	301.5	 and then when she can stay like that I'm going to start marking and reinforcing the moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=308.3s	308.3	 that my hand goes away I mark and then I bring the treat back to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=312.7s	312.7	 And then when she gets better I can go and collect more treats out of this hand that's holding the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 treats like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=319.1s	319.1	 If she were to get up from the position like that I'm just going to lure her back into the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=326.2s	326.2	 and go back to putting the treat down between her paws like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=331.1s	331.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=332.1s	332.1	 Then I'm going to release her free and encourage her up by moving my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=337.3s	337.3	 So first I say the release cue then I move the hand and you can use the word like get it as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=343.1s	343.1	 to get them interested in getting the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=345.8s	345.8	 If you've done a lot of leave it exercises you can encourage your puppy to follow a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=350.7s	350.7	 by saying get it or making kissy noise or moving backwards but because she's so small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=357.5s	357.5	 that's why I'm sitting down here with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=360.7s	360.7	 Okay now from the standing position I'm going to click and reinforce her for standing like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=368.8s	368.8	 and then I'm going to start to increase the amount of time that she waits before I bring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=374.3s	374.3	 the treat back to her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=377.4s	377.4	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=381.7s	381.7	 Awesome.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=387.6s	387.6	 like this and teaching her the different positions and how to get into them by feeding her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=393.3s	393.3	 letting her nibble on the treat as she got into the positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=396.7s	396.7	 So teaching the sit to the down to the stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=400.5s	400.5	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=401.5s	401.5	 She knows there's no treat there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=402.6s	402.6	 Get it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=408.2s	408.2	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=416.4s	416.4	 able to move my hand away then I started marking and reinforcing her for staying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=420.9s	420.9	 a little bit longer each time so I'd feed her a treat and then move my hand away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=426.9s	426.9	 mark and reinforce and then if she just got up I would lure her back into the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=432.6s	432.6	 and begin again and remember to release her at some point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=436.0s	436.0	 Free.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=440.7s	440.7	 Now as you can see she's really good at staying in the positions not as much in the stand as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=446.9s	446.9	 the sit and the down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=448.3s	448.3	 The down is probably her strongest because we worked on that one a lot and not so much the sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=452.8s	452.8	 or the stand and now I'm going to add the cues for the behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=458.7s	458.7	 So because she can stay in the position for 10 to 15 seconds I can then start to add the cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=465.5s	465.5	 because the problem with if they quickly pop out of position if you don't give them the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=469.8s	469.8	 soon enough is that you keep saying sit sit sit and down down down so I prefer to add the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=475.6s	475.6	 verbal cue a little bit later but you can add the different hand signals right from the start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=482.0s	482.0	 So to do that you pretend to get a treat and when the dog is in the down position you lift your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=487.6s	487.6	 hand up like that and then give them a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=490.3s	490.3	 So there's no treat in your hand but you're pretending to have the treat in the same way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=495.3s	495.3	 that you had it when you were luring the dog and letting them nibble on the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=500.7s	500.7	 and now there's no treat in your hand and you're marking and reinforcing the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=506.0s	506.0	 for following the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=508.0s	508.0	 Now also if your dog has gotten better at luring you can then have the treat in your hand away from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=513.5s	513.5	 the dog's mouth so they're not nibbling at your hand if you haven't given them the treat yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=519.0s	519.0	 So I'm holding the treat like this away from the dog's mouth so that she's not nibbling at it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=525.0s	525.0	 and when I want her to eat the treat I'm holding it like this like I'm feeding a baby bird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=529.9s	529.9	 so that she can eat it as she moves and when I don't want her to eat it I have my hand the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=537.6s	537.6	 Get it get it good good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=541.9s	541.9	 So the hand signals you can teach your dog are based on the way that you've lured the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=547.0s	547.0	 So to get the dog from a down to a sit a gesture like this and to get the dog to lay down a gesture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=554.0s	554.0	 like that and for stand I use an open hand like this and to initially train it the open hand has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=561.2s	561.2	 a treat in it and I say get it to the dog get it and I wiggle it if the dog doesn't think they can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=568.1s	568.1	 have it. So a stand to down to sit and then sit to stand get it which she hasn't worked on yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=580.2s	580.2	 but she should because it will be good for her back legs get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=584.7s	584.7	 Awesome get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=591.6s	591.6	 Now I really need to work on stand because watch when I let go of the treat she goes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=595.3s	595.3	 automatically into the other positions I've reinforced. So if you notice that happening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=600.3s	600.3	 your dog when you're trying to teach them to down they start sitting or you're trying to teach them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=606.1s	606.1	 to sit and they keep laying down it means that you just need to reinforce the other position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=611.7s	611.7	 as well and I like to work on at least three at the same time so if you're working on sit down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=617.7s	617.7	 and stand it's going to be less confusing than if you just work on sit and down because then the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=623.9s	623.9	 might alternate between the different positions if they don't know what you want. To add the verbal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=630.4s	630.4	 cue you say it just before you move to do the visual cue or the luring gesture so I'm going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=636.0s	636.0	 to say sit and then I'm going to move my hand like that say down and then move my hand like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=643.2s	643.2	 Awesome usually if the puppy has learned to follow your hand gesture from a distance at first that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=651.0s	651.0	 going to then help with teaching the new cue because the dog is their reliance on your hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=659.3s	659.3	 being there with the treat they haven't yet learned to down while your hands are away

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=671.6s	671.6	 behavior so if you've gotten to the point where you can have the treats here and the dog is still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=676.8s	676.8	 sitting and downing it's going to be way easier to add the verbal cue where your hands aren't even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=681.8s	681.8	 near the dog. So I'm going to say down and then I'm going to move my hand gesture to get the dog to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=712.9s	712.9	 while they're doing it which is kind of cute if it's a chihuahua but maybe not cute if it's an

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=724.0s	724.0	 to do in approximations so here you can see I'm bending over as I do the hand signals really close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=730.4s	730.4	 down to the ground as the initial step to then being able to stand up and do the hand signals

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=7991.4s	7991.4	 you will be teaching your dog that he can move freely within the space designated try not to click your dog for standing still sitting or laying down or your dog could start thinking it's about staying in one position and not within the barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8007.4s	8007.4	 if you're working somewhere where there's long grass and your dog can't find the treats that you've thrown you can simply run back to your dog and feed your dog behind the barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8021.4s	8021.4	 the advantage of throwing the treats is that you don't have to keep running back and forth to give the dog the treat and you can reinforce your dog for being far away from you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8031.4s	8031.4	 now it's time to raise criteria there are many ways to raise criteria but first we'll start with distance so i'm going to get further away from the dog and reinforce the dog for staying behind the barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8051.4s	8051.4	 if you raise criteria too quickly and your dog comes over the barrier there are many things you can do you can either wait and see if your dog offers to go back behind the barrier you can point you can give your dog a cue you can tell them to back up or you could lure your dog back behind the barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8067.4s	8067.4	 the first five times that your dog comes over the barrier you can reinforce them for thinking to go back behind the barrier again but if you keep doing this it'll become a habit so if your dog comes over the barrier after five times encourage your dog back behind the barrier but wait for something better raise criteria and see if your dog can stay behind the barrier before clicking and reinforcing them again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8092.4s	8092.4	 here are some exercises to do to proof the behavior walk back and forth in front of the dog near and far walk through the area and then out stopping it first run through the area and out and do some random movement practice from each side of the barrier as though it were a new behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8109.4s	8109.4	 here you can see we're working on the concept that if something the dog wants leaves the area that the dog's supposed to stay in the dog should stay behind and not follow the thing that they want to get to do this you click and feed your dog as you leave the barrier before the dog has a chance to leave the barrier himself and then you wait the dog out and see if the dog will stay as you move forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8134.4s	8134.4	 if your dog does follow you over the barrier simply encourage your dog back quickly and then try again but this time make it easier for your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8145.4s	8145.4	 here you can see I'm making it easier for Trish by stopping reinforcing and then moving forwards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8151.4s	8151.4	 the next time I'm going to wait to see if she thinks to stop before clicking and coming back to reinforce her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8165.4s	8165.4	 this is Trish's first lesson of barrier training as you can see dogs are highly intelligent and can understand complex concepts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8195.4s	8195.4	 this is just the beginning of the training process you want your dog to stay behind the barrier with high level distractions as well as low level distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8204.4s	8204.4	 adding a release cue you want to treat the release cue as a behavior itself you've reinforced your dog for staying behind the barrier and now you want to teach your dog that when you say the release cue it's okay to leave the barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8226.4s	8226.4	 to do this you simply say the release cue encourage your dog over the barrier and click and reinforce your dog for coming out of the barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8236.4s	8236.4	 you can also teach your dog a cue to mean go back behind the barrier to do this you simply say the cue encourage your dog back and click when your dog goes back behind the barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8248.4s	8248.4	 stimulus control on the release cue means 1. the dog leaves the barrier immediately when asked 2. the dog never leaves the barrier without a release 3. the dog never leaves the barrier in response to another stimuli and 4. no other behavior occurs in response to the release cue besides leaving the barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8271.4s	8271.4	 once you've created stimulus control on your release cue your dog will know that the only stimulus that means they can leave the barrier area is if you say the release cue and not anything else for example a frisbee being thrown, a cat running by, your parents coming to visit, or another dog walking on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8291.4s	8291.4	 to achieve stimulus control on your release cue you'll need to do a lot of proofing until your dog can generalize the behavior to all circumstances
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8299.4s	8299.4	 to do this you're going to click and reinforce your dog as the distraction happens and then as your dog gets better and better you're going to withhold your click so the dog is dealing with more distractions before the reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8320.4s	8320.4	 here's a proofing list

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w2Cf-FmEE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=161&pp=iAQB&t=8358.4s	8358.4	 remember safety first if you think your dog might cross the barrier and you're in an unsafe area simply keep your dog in the harness and long line so they can't get into danger
