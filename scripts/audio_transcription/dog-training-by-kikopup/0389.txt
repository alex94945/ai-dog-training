https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=4.2s	4.2	 This is not only a useful cue for shy, reactive, and over-excited dogs, but it's a great cue

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=20.7s	20.7	 Let's Go, or perhaps you've stopped at a street light and then the light changes, you can

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=31.9s	31.9	 other dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 If they start looking like they're going to bark, you can give your dog the cue, Let's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 Go, and stop your dog from offering that unwanted behavior of acting over-excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=44.5s	44.5	 Okay, so this is Gremlin, and Gremlin's not learned this cue yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=51.4s	51.4	 Gremlin's very new to clicker training, so I'm going to go over right from the start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 how you would train this cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=57.7s	57.7	 In conjunction with teaching Let's Go, you should teach your dog to give in to leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=61.9s	61.9	 pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=62.9s	62.9	 Here is a video tutorial on how to teach this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=70.1s	70.1	 emergency situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=72.8s	72.8	 I like to hold the leash and the clicker in my left hand when the dog is on my left side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=77.3s	77.3	 and feed with my right hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=79.5s	79.5	 However, if you're not experienced with this and getting the treat to your dog only behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 far back on your left side, your dog could start to creep in front of you and you get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=390&pp=iAQB&t=88.3s	88.3	 a dog that's anticipating you feeding them and walking in front of you like this, blocking
