https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=14.5s	14.5	 on leave it quite a few weeks ago leaving it from food in a container on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=37.2s	37.2	 what's on the counters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 Pup pups! Bliss! Hi! What are you doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=45.8s	45.8	 Which says I know exactly what he was doing. If you do find your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=55.7s	55.7	 counter surfing I suggest interrupting as quickly as you can using a positively

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=65.9s	65.9	 getting your dog. So there I lifted him off the table neutrally and here I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=70.1s	70.1	 calling his name and also preventing him from drinking the gravy. It can feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=77.1s	77.1	 tempting to want to tell your dog off for counter surfing but the same applies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=81.3s	81.3	 to house training. If you tell your dog off for doing the things you don't like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=85.3s	85.3	 what can happen is they can start to hide them from you so the dog could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 start peeing in other rooms or counter surfing in other rooms that you're not

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=98.8s	98.8	 and it makes it extremely easy to interrupt and then train your dog what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=103.1s	103.1	 you do want them to do.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 of the counter that he could reach potentially and also making sure there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 no crumbs. So even if there's a teeny weeny crumb and your dog puts their feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=159.5s	159.5	 up and they lick the crumb that's going to reinforce the dog for putting their

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 love that my dogs don't counter surf and I have seven dogs. Little dogs they can't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=174.5s	174.5	 reach the counter but it's wonderful to not worry about them going on the counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=179.7s	179.7	 and eating stuff. Okay so I do have a tutorial on how to train this so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=186.1s	186.1	 can watch that first and I'll link it in the description below but I'm just going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=189.9s	189.9	 to work on my boy and work on him at the steps that he already is at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=197.4s	197.4	 So I have some medium value treats and I'm going to put these low value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=206.5s	206.5	 treats on the table like that and I can mark and reinforce as they go onto the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=212.4s	212.4	 table. So I've kept the leash let's see if you can see me I'm keeping the leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=219.5s	219.5	 short enough that he can't reach the table to sniff at the treats and if he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=224.8s	224.8	 were to sniff he's far enough away that he can easily turn back to me. So that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 how I'm setting him up for success. If I were to put something better in here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=238.5s	238.5	 because he's being too good. If I were to put the treats right in front of him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=244.1s	244.1	 like that and then say leave it and try to get him to come back to me that's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=248.2s	248.2	 a great way to break the steps up small enough in small approximations to teach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=253.2s	253.2	 him to just leave stuff alone without going to think to bother it. You saw when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=259.1s	259.1	 I put the treats on the table it was easy enough for him to completely ignore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=262.9s	262.9	 because we've worked on the steps of leave it already but if it's too close
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=267.2s	267.2	 to him say we're right here and I've got the treats right there and he's sniffing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=272.5s	272.5	 at it and there's something really exciting in there it's gonna be hard to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=276.8s	276.8	 teach him to then oh hi ignore it and I he's just really you're just doing too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 well of course you would. Okay so we're gonna up the ante some melted cheese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=290.3s	290.3	 we were out in the field having a playdate with a little cattle dog and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=295.5s	295.5	 this cheese has gotten all smelly and melted in my treat bag and it's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=300.4s	300.4	 first day in his life that he's ever had cheese so that should be interesting to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=305.3s	305.3	 him. So I put that cheese into the container and I also have cheese so in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=311.4s	311.4	 this exercise it's extremely important that when you're first working on the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=315.5s	315.5	 default leave it that there's low value treats on the table and high value

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=325.1s	325.1	 of just training my own dog I'm gonna make him a little bit more interested in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=329.4s	329.4	 the treats as if to simulate what your dog might look like. So he's already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=333.9s	333.9	 looking at the table to see what's on there so I'm gonna call him away make

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=349.4s	349.4	 forth over here and mark him for looking but not walking towards the treats and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=356.9s	356.9	 then mark him for not looking at all. I've got to find that piece of cheese because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=363.0s	363.0	 I was feeding him the medium value treats and you can see he can easily

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKE1hY49RA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=120&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 lesson. I had the cheese like this in a stick because I wasn't training I was
