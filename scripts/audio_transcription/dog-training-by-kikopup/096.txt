https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone and welcome to Kikopup's dog training tip of the day for today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 I got a comment on my previous video that they wanted to know how to teach the dog to go around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=11.9s	11.9	 In order to then catch a frisbee. Oh, he said he said he would do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=17.1s	17.1	 But basically all you have to do is have two toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=21.2s	21.2	 That the dog knows not to just jump up and grab or with a puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=25.6s	25.6	 You can be really fast so the toy moves faster than the puppy can go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 So you say go round and then pick up the dog with the other toy get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 Oh, yeah, you gotta be fast ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Are you steady?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=62.1s	62.1	 Go around go around go around wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 Ready go circle go circle go circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=75.8s	75.8	 Yeah, he liked that game he liked that game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 At first you don't want to add the verbal cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=83.1s	83.1	 Until you see the dog is able to do the behavior reliably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 So follow the toy behind your back without just grabbing at it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=90.5s	90.5	 And so I also have the other direction which I call go circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 So I say go circle and then I pick him up with the other toy on the other side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 Now if you're not standing up the dog most likely is going to go and grab the toy that you just hide behind your back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=106.5s	106.5	 So it's really a learned behavior that he's you know following the two different toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 Another thing you can do is lure the dog and then have it disappear and reappear like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 Drop and you can do the same with treats go circle go circle go circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=123.2s	123.2	 kitty
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 if you had a disc in your hand you could lure the dog back with a disc like this and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=129.9s	129.9	 Then when the dogs focus on the disc you can then throw it so they can catch it nicely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=134.8s	134.8	 Good job and because he's not yet his growth plates have not yet closed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=139.9s	139.9	 I'm not gonna have him jump. I might just have him catch the disc like that drop good go round
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=148.1s	148.1	 Kitty good boy drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=150.5s	150.5	 go and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=152.5s	152.5	 Roll the disc good job. I am NOT a frisbee expert at all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=157.8s	157.8	 I'm terrible at throwing a frisbee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=160.1s	160.1	 But what I learned from the amazing frisbee community is a way of getting the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 First chasing the disc when they're a puppy or you're just beginning frisbee is to you're gonna throw it like this like a normal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=174.4s	174.4	 Frisbee, but you turn it like that and then you can just roll it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 So you can practice asking your dog to go around you and then give them a little roller. It's called drop go round and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=187.7s	187.7	 Then roll it like that good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=191.5s	191.5	 Lie down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 Drop go round and that will increase the speed of your dog going around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 Drop go round
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=204.9s	204.9	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=206.1s	206.1	 It's gonna take some training. I've already worked with him on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 So don't think it's gonna be this fast that your dog might pick it up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=212.6s	212.6	 They might if they have great skills at being polite with toys and treats, but if they haven't learned drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 To follow a toy without just grabbing at it then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 Get it, and then then it's gonna be a little bit more tricky. So drop a nice game to play is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=231.7s	231.7	 The previous game where I was showing you how to teach the dog to drop the toy reliably as well as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=238.1s	238.1	 Another game is you don't want to you want to proof your dog not getting the toy until you say get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=243.6s	243.6	 So they can follow it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=245.9s	245.9	 Get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=247.2s	247.2	 Get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 But they can't grab at it until you say get it get it. Good boy. That's awfully close to my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=255.5s	255.5	 Hello, so if you have a dog that's climbing up you to bite your hand instead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=263.2s	263.2	 Chomp on the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 What you can do is go back a step. So you're just drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=269.9s	269.9	 Lissy drop you're just gonna get give the dog the toy good and then get him to have the other toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=276.6s	276.6	 Good and what you're doing is you're pulling back good and marking when he has his mouth closed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=283.2s	283.2	 So I'm gonna pull back good drop get it pull back drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=288.4s	288.4	 Get it and he's not having time to readjust so I'm adding do you see how?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 He can't readjust because I'm putting pressure on it good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=297.6s	297.6	 Get it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=300.6s	300.6	 So I'm he readjusted a little bit, but when he gives it to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 I'm gonna pull back good like that and tell him he's doing a good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=309.7s	309.7	 Get it when he's pulling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 Like that, so there he's readjusting see cuz I'm not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 I'm not pulling enough drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=320.4s	320.4	 Good that's nice. Get it good drop get it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=331.4s	331.4	 I like to teach my dogs to change direction and run the opposite direction by turning away from me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 And you can easily train that with a lure and add a verbal cue to it or a frisbee a food lure or a toy lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=344.2s	344.2	 But you're simply gonna have the dog facing forward with you and then you just turn them around good and get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=351.4s	351.4	 Where did you go bring it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=353.4s	353.4	 Where did you go bring?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=356.0s	356.0	 Good job drop and on the other side. This is called left turn, but we were working on another trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=362.7s	362.7	 That you might have seen in my shorts where she's turning her head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=366.6s	366.6	 So I'm gonna say left turn and she already knows it go round
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M1WDv-zros&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=97&pp=iAQB&t=371.2s	371.2	 Right turn go circle left turn go around right turn go circle
