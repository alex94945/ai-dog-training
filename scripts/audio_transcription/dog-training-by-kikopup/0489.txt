https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 What I'm doing here is putting a pen cap with poster tack in it on top of the switch so it makes the switch easier to turn on and off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 I'm also using poster tack on the back of the light switch to make it secure yet easy to move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 Click for touches. Hold the light switch up and click your dog for touching it with his nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=42.8s	42.8	 If your dog knows chin targeting or nose targeting, you can get the ball rolling by practicing those first before you begin the lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 Luring, push and off. You can free shape your dog to turn the light switches on and off, but in this video I'm going to show you how you can use luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 What I am doing is lifting the treat upwards so the dog's top of the nose turns the switch on and pulling the treat downwards so the dog's chin turns the switch off and saying yes as the switch moves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=74.8s	74.8	 What I am not doing is pushing the switch onto the dog. The dog is doing all the movement while the switch stays still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 Fading the lure. The next step is doing the hand gesture further and further away from the dog while still marking them for touching the switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=93.8s	93.8	 You can start to use the clicker now because the clicker won't be right next to your dog's ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=98.8s	98.8	 Once your dog is reliably turning the switch on and off with the hand gesture, you can add a verbal cue before you do the hand gesture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=105.8s	105.8	 The next step is waiting the dog out, so ask for the behavior and wait. Click even the tiniest intention of the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 If your dog seems lost or frustrated, go back to the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=119.8s	119.8	 Here you can see I reverted back to the hand signal with tug when he started to do something weird with his back feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=125.8s	125.8	 Once your dog is getting it, you can also start to feed them away from the switch so they have to run towards the switch to turn it on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=132.8s	132.8	 Here you can see I am using the technique of withholding a click to teach the dog to turn the switch all the way down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 Here you can see I am using blatant luring to teach the dog to put his paws up in the area where the light switch is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 First I am doing it with a treat, and then I am doing it with no treat in my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=153.8s	153.8	 Here you can see I raised criteria too quickly with tug and confused him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=157.8s	157.8	 so I had to go back a step and create a new passage line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=161.8s	161.8	 Tangled fingers can park the dog quickly and AMAZED with editing practice!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 Now when I am changing positions correctly or parlaring, it will keep the pace up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=171.8s	171.8	 Here you can see I raised criteria too quickly with tug and confused him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=181.8s	181.8	 so I had to go back a step and create interest in the light switch again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=201.8s	201.8	 Ready? Go push! Tug, go push! Yes! Ready? Tug, go off! Yes! Tug, go push! Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=220.8s	220.8	 Kiko and Splash were trained to turn the light switches on and off using free shaping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=224.8s	224.8	 I wanted to show with tug that you can teach the same quality of behaviour using luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=230.8s	230.8	 The footage of tug in this video was taken from one single training session of 10 minutes long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=235.8s	235.8	 Tug already understood the process of fading a lure and adding a verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=240.8s	240.8	 If your dog doesn't know this, it might take a couple more training sessions to achieve these results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_M9Fzc94U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=490&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 See you next time!
