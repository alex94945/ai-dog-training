https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everybody, I'd love to introduce you to the latest member of the Kikopup family,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 this little border collie puppy over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=8.1s	8.1	 He's eight and a half weeks and he is really social with people and dogs, which is super
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=13.3s	13.3	 exciting and he's also very cute and sweet and snuggly and just a really nice guy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=20.6s	20.6	 Hey boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=21.6s	21.6	 Okay, so I just wanted to talk to you about what we've been doing since he got home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 I brought him home in the evening yesterday and he did really well in the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=34.9s	34.9	 I put him into the crate after he'd played with his litter mates and sprinkled food and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=39.9s	39.9	 it was a two hour drive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 Because he's super poofy and he can get hot easily, I cranked up the air conditioning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=46.9s	46.9	 and pointed it at him and that really helped him to pass out and sleep nicely all the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=52.8s	52.8	 home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=54.7s	54.7	 Got the air conditioning cranked right up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=57.7s	57.7	 This is a little polar bear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 And then I made sure that he did enough activities before bedtime when he went into the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=69.8s	69.8	 And when he went into the crate, I sprinkled food in the crate so that he wanted to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=77.4s	77.4	 in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 Then I closed the gate and laid right next to the mesh and I laid there until he fell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 asleep and then I snuck away and got into my own bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=91.3s	91.3	 So I'm laying on the floor next to the crate until he goes to sleep because he's never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 been in a crate like this before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 And I sprinkled some of his kibble in there and I'm putting my hand up against the metal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=104.7s	104.7	 so he can lick at it and then staying just a few inches away so that he feels comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 And then when he goes to sleep, I will move into my own bed and see if he is okay with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 Oh, you're going to eat the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 Puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 And he did pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 He slept until 12 and then he really needed to go out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=127.7s	127.7	 So I let him out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=128.7s	128.7	 A lot of people think you shouldn't let a dog out if they're whining, but they're whining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 because usually they need to pee or they're freaked out about being in a new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 So I suggest taking the dog out, seeing if they go to the bathroom and then just put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=142.8s	142.8	 them back in the crate to look for some kibble and sit next to the crate until they go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=148.8s	148.8	 to sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=149.8s	149.8	 If you put them into the crate and then quickly walk away, what can happen is they can start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 to get worried and then freak out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=157.5s	157.5	 Hey Pupsy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 So another thing that I did yesterday was get him super interested in playing with toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 So the first thing that we did when we came home after he had a brief introduction to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 my dogs was I came in here with him alone and I just got him interested in playing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=182.8s	182.8	 toys and these toys are spread throughout my house, not tons of them because if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=188.3s	188.3	 have too many toys in your house, what can happen is they think anything on the floor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 is a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 So you want to create a reinforcement history of playing with the things you want first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=199.7s	199.7	 and make them super fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=201.6s	201.6	 I don't know where I put his chew bone, but he has a nice rubbery chew bone to chew on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=207.1s	207.1	 to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=209.1s	209.1	 So for his chewing needs and these for his playing needs and he's been learning to play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=215.2s	215.2	 with toys and also watch my other dogs play with toys without having to go over and grab
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=220.6s	220.6	 them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 So we've been, I've been playing with him and then playing with the other dogs nearby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=225.5s	225.5	 So he's learning that he can have play with any toy he wants that's available, but the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 ones in the other dog's mouths are not available, especially little dog mouths.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=235.2s	235.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=236.2s	236.2	 So yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=237.2s	237.2	 And because I've done this, he's just not chewed on any of the stuff in my house, which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=242.5s	242.5	 is super amazing and fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 Makes it really easy to have him around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=246.9s	246.9	 So I took the whole day off yesterday just to make sure that when he was loose, I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=252.3s	252.3	 reinforcing him for interest in toys and the same with today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 It's the evening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=257.7s	257.7	 So I made sure to really get him interested in those toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 And if he's going off to find something like looking at the cords of my camera, I will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 And then immediately play with, play with his toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 Now you might've heard the same story when I had my other puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 I've probably, if you've watched all my videos, you've heard me say this before, but it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=282.3s	282.3	 so important because if you make the first things they chew on their toys, it sets you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=287.6s	287.6	 up for success because if you don't do that, what they do, they walk in your house and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 they immediately go for the corners of the sofa and the carpet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=296.1s	296.1	 So by creating a reinforcement history for the things you want, it really saves time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=301.6s	301.6	 and stress when you have a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=303.7s	303.7	 Another thing is I've been taking him out every hour to go to the bathroom and it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=308.1s	308.1	 pretty easy with because I have a border collie, an older 14 year old border collie with bladder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=313.1s	313.1	 cancer has to go constantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=315.7s	315.7	 So every time she goes out, he goes out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=318.6s	318.6	 So he's not had an accident in the house yet, but if he does, that's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=325.4s	325.4	 It's good to watch them 100% to get them not chewing on your stuff and not going to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=330.6s	330.6	 bathroom in your house, but every once in a while little puppies can't hold their bladder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=335.5s	335.5	 So if you have a couple accidents, it's not the end of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbNvPXVVJA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=132&pp=iAQB&t=339.4s	339.4	 It just means to pay attention more.
