https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everybody, this video is on the topic of teaching your puppy to go to his bed and lay on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=6.2s	6.2	 The first step of teaching this behavior is simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 showing your puppy that you've put some treats in the bed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=14.1s	14.1	 marking and reinforcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=16.6s	16.6	 multiple times while the pup is on the bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=19.9s	19.9	 Choosing the appropriate bed is going to set you up for success and it doesn't matter if the puppy is laying down on the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=27.4s	27.4	 At first you can just mark the puppy standing with first the front feet and all four feet on the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 So the bigger the bed the easier this is if you have a very small bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 They might come on with just the front feet and and not the back feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 So another really beneficial behavior to teach along with teaching go to the bed is also working on a calm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 Settle and teaching the dog to lay down with a lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=53.8s	53.8	 so I'll link videos in the in the description below on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=58.3s	58.3	 How to train those two behaviors and that will really help with this behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 Because as you can see my puppy is already thinking to settle on the bed like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 This is Bliss my 11 week old border collie puppy and he's had some prior training to learning to go to a mat and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=78.9s	78.9	 The settle and teaching the dam so another thing is I taught him to settle while I talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 So he doesn't get frustrated when I make video tutorials like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 Another thing that I really think is important to tell is a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 will get their puppy a bed put it in their pen and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=99.4s	99.4	 Without any training the puppy thinks it's a toy and choose on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 So if you get a new bed and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 Work on this exercise where you're reinforcing the dog for going to the bed eating treats on the bed and laying on the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=111.4s	111.4	 it's gonna highly reduce the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 He's already figured it out. It's gonna highly reduce the tendency of the puppy to chew on the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=121.4s	121.4	 So if you have the chewing on the bed problem already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=124.7s	124.7	 You can get a different bed that looks different a different texture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=128.6s	128.6	 Bring it out in training sessions and work on this exercise and training sessions put that bed away and after
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 Maybe five training sessions see if you can use the bed in different rooms and see if the puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=142.3s	142.3	 Thinks not to chew on that specific bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 And then you can leave the old bed in the pen that's already been chewed up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=150.5s	150.5	 Okay, or no bed if the puppy is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=154.1s	154.1	 Eating parts of the bed. Are you ready? So here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 So I'm gonna use a release cue because he's on the bed already. So I'm gonna say free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 Mark and reinforce him for getting off the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 Because for this cue I want him to stay on the bed until released
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 so for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=172.3s	172.3	 I might be wanting to make a YouTube video and they settle in their beds and I can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=177.1s	177.1	 He keeps waving at me because I worked on the trick of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=180.6s	180.6	 Wave yesterday. Okay. The next step is pretending to toss a treat into the bed and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=186.8s	186.8	 Marking and reinforcing the puppy for going to look for the treats in the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=191.3s	191.3	 Now we've repeated this game multiple times with a mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=194.7s	194.7	 So most likely he's gonna figure out the game very quickly and I can show you all the steps of how to train this behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=200.6s	200.6	 With this guy because we've worked on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=202.5s	202.5	 But it might take a couple of training sessions of just getting the dog going to the bed to look for the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=208.8s	208.8	 Where they are going to offer going to the bed when you pretend to throw a treat some dogs are super smart and they'll think oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=215.7s	215.7	 She didn't throw one. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=218.1s	218.1	 When you first start pretending to throw a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=221.1s	221.1	 The first time you do it then after you've pretended to throw a treat the next time you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=226.5s	226.5	 Send the dog to the bed actually throw a treat so they don't start to think that you're never gonna throw a treat there anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=233.9s	233.9	 Good job, and you don't have to mark and reinforce you can simply toss treats into the bed like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=240.1s	240.1	 But I like to mark and reinforce just when I initially train this behavior good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=247.1s	247.1	 Okay, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=250.3s	250.3	 Once the dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=252.2s	252.2	 Once you've repeated this exercise multiple times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=254.9s	254.9	 You can release the dog and then see if the dog might think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=258.4s	258.4	 To go into the bed on his own and you can mark and reinforce and you can even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=263.5s	263.5	 Lore the puppy into a down like that and mark and reinforce the puppy for staying in the down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=274.8s	274.8	 Free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=276.3s	276.3	 Awesome, so you want to make sure that you say free before you then encourage the puppy out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=281.2s	281.2	 So free is the release cue from the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=284.8s	284.8	 Okay, another way to get the puppy to offer going in the bed is see I have this wall back here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=291.5s	291.5	 And the bed is right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=292.8s	292.8	 So if I move this way and the puppy's following me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=296.2s	296.2	 I can mark the puppy when the puppy goes on to the bed if it's large enough if your puppy is walking around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=302.4s	302.4	 The bed and not going on to it that tells you that you still need to work on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 Reinforcing the puppy for wanting to be on the bed and because the puppy is avoiding going on it free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=314.3s	314.3	 Awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=315.9s	315.9	 So now I'm going to approach the bed from this angle and mark the moment that the puppy heads on to the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=323.2s	323.2	 mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=326.3s	326.3	 Awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 Great I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=331.4s	331.4	 Can start to add the cue of go to the bed when the puppy is reliably?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=336.9s	336.9	 Following a treat into the bed when I toss it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=340.7s	340.7	 You can add the cue later when the puppy is reliably offering the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=344.8s	344.8	 But because it's really easy to get the puppy on the bed you can add it as soon as you start training free for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=352.2s	352.2	 I can say go to your bed and then toss the treat on and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 Then the puppy is going to start to associate go to the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=360.1s	360.1	 Means the treats are going to go on to the bed if your puppy is not going on to the bed when you toss the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 Yet don't add the cue they might not have figured out to follow a tossed treat yet, and you need to do that first hello
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=372.8s	372.8	 You keep waving at me free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 Awesome, so I'm gonna say go to the bed, and if you didn't think to go there I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=381.4s	381.4	 Could then toss the treats to get him to go there within a second or two of him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=387.3s	387.3	 Hesitating and then wait and see if he might offer going to the bed without saying the cue before I then start adding that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=395.2s	395.2	 Verbal cue of going to the bed free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=400.2s	400.2	 So I can say go to the bed and then when he's doing really well lure him into the down before then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=408.1s	408.1	 Mocking and reinforcing the behavior like that good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=414.1s	414.1	 Right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=415.7s	415.7	 So I'm only giving him one treat when he comes out at the moment because I really want him to go back to offering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=423.2s	423.2	 Going into the bed and what I'm waiting for now is for when he lays down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=427.8s	427.8	 So I could stand closer to the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=430.6s	430.6	 So that he's less likely to get up to come and find me which will make him get out of the down position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=436.6s	436.6	 So I can stand right next to the bed in order to reinforce him offering laying down now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=442.7s	442.7	 I suggest choosing a nice cushy bed the dog enjoys laying on if you have a little Chihuahua or Italian Greyhound
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=450.3s	450.3	 You can use some luxurious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=452.8s	452.8	 Blanket nest and that might make them more likely to want to lay on the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=457.2s	457.2	 You want to make sure that you're putting the treat down between the paws on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=462.2s	462.2	 So the dog is anticipating getting the reinforcement from below rather than up here because what can happen is they can start to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=470.6s	470.6	 Lean upwards as you come in with the treat like that. So if they constantly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=476.7s	476.7	 Anticipating the food coming from the ground that's gonna keep them in a nice relaxed down like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=487.2s	487.2	 So as I've said previously in some of my videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=491.2s	491.2	 Get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=492.4s	492.4	 Some ways of teaching the down are just holding a treat down on the ground and marking when the puppy thinks to lay down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=498.9s	498.9	 It might take them a little longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=501.0s	501.0	 It's a thing to lay down and another way to get a puppy to lay down is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=505.1s	505.1	 When they're standing up you put the treat push the treat at a diagonal towards them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=510.4s	510.4	 And yet first you can just mark a little shoulder fold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=519.2s	519.2	 After a few training sessions once your puppy is doing really well with this behavior you can then add distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=525.6s	525.6	 Distractions and duration with this behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=528.8s	528.8	 So you want to add those the same way you do with a stay one at a time and then when you add them together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=535.0s	535.0	 You make it a lot easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=536.5s	536.5	 So if you can walk 20 feet away from your puppy and your puppy can stay there while another dog is doing stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=543.6s	543.6	 You're not gonna then have the other dog do stuff at 20 feet away. You could have just the other dog doing stuff a few feet away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=551.8s	551.8	 to begin with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=553.9s	553.9	 Also, as I said earlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=555.8s	555.8	 Teaching the dog to relax and settle around food is gonna greatly increase your chances of the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=563.4s	563.4	 Seeing this behavior as a calm behavior where they just relax for duration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=568.0s	568.0	 Rather than get frustrated if they didn't get a treat. So the subtle is really going to help with adding duration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=574.3s	574.3	 So I suggest you work on that along with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=577.5s	577.5	 teaching go to the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=579.2s	579.2	 So what I'm gonna do here is work on walking around him at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=585.1s	585.1	 So I'm just gonna drop a treat there and walk around him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=593.2s	593.2	 Good and if he's doing really well, I can add more exciting movement while I'm nearby. Whoo-hoo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=603.1s	603.1	 Squatting down and standing up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=606.4s	606.4	 While I'm nearby
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=609.8s	609.8	 Add some distance over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=613.6s	613.6	 He moved a little bit so I'm gonna put the treat back where he was before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=618.2s	618.2	 So he doesn't think he needs to get closer and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=622.4s	622.4	 the goal is for the puppy not to get up, but if the puppy gets up you lower the puppy back and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=629.4s	629.4	 Wait till the puppy lays down or lower them back into the down and then make it easier again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=634.9s	634.9	 So the goal is for the puppy not to get up because the way they're gonna learn this behavior is by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=641.1s	641.1	 Reinforcing them when you do the distractions at first and then when they get really good you start to delay when you reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=648.4s	648.4	 So at first you're gonna mark as you do the step and that's gonna reinforce them for staying and then you're gonna mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=656.1s	656.1	 After you do a couple of distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=659.0s	659.0	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=661.5s	661.5	 So if I was gonna use food as a distraction and drop food down here at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=667.2s	667.2	 I'm marking as I'm going to place the food on the floor like this and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=673.5s	673.5	 Then I'm going to delay when I click good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=680.4s	680.4	 So he's getting reinforced after the distraction happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=686.0s	686.0	 He said that was hard it looks like you're gonna give me the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=691.9s	691.9	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=696.3s	696.3	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=698.8s	698.8	 Awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=700.2s	700.2	 So if the dog were to think to get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=703.8s	703.8	 It's not going to help them learn the behavior of staying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=707.8s	707.8	 What you're doing is you're reinforcing the behavior you want so I suggest if your puppy gets up three times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=714.3s	714.3	 Within a minute that means that your criteria is too high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=718.0s	718.0	 So one thing you can try is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=720.7s	720.7	 Asking for less or trying a less valuable treat because sometimes if your treats are too high value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=727.7s	727.7	 The puppy might just want to keep coming towards you to get the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=732.6s	732.6	 If they haven't learned that they can do stuff away from very exciting treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=737.4s	737.4	 So I'm actually using his kibble for this exercise and he's finding it really reinforcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=742.7s	742.7	 So if you notice that you're working with a lower value treat and then the puppy starts to check out and look around the room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=749.2s	749.2	 then that's telling you that the treat is too low value for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=753.2s	753.2	 the the behavior to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=755.9s	755.9	 reinforced
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=757.1s	757.1	 So you really want where your puppy's paying a hundred percent attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=760.5s	760.5	 But isn't looking frantic or stressed by the fact that you have stuff on you when they're further away from you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=766.9s	766.9	 You can also work on handling exercises while the puppy relaxes in the bed like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=772.3s	772.3	 And I have a video on how to teach handling in the description below and then you can just add the two together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=778.8s	778.8	 While you're teaching your puppy to relax and accept calm handling and petting or grooming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=784.8s	784.8	 Good while relaxing in the bed. I hope this video was helpful for your training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=790.6s	790.6	 Thank you so much for watching if you'd like to support my work

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=806.5s	806.5	 So now that he's had a training session, he most likely will need to go out to the bathroom free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNHyMgsZ5QE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=812.8s	812.8	 So that's where we're headed
