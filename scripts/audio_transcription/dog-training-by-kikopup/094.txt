https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone and welcome to Kikopup's dog training tip of the day for today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4.9s	4.9	 Today I'm going to be talking about asking for a behavior at a distance and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=9.4s	9.4	 beginning from scratch. So with Epic here she has a couple behaviors that are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=14.6s	14.6	 pretty strong. I wouldn't say reliable but I believe that by doing some distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=21.4s	21.4	 work that's a great way of proofing those behaviors. So one behavior that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=26.4s	26.4	 would be super cute is teaching her to sit and wave from a distance. So I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=32.5s	32.5	 beginning by first warming up with the behavior and getting her used to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=37.3s	37.3	 fact that we're just going to be working on on waving. I gave her a big treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=41.4s	41.4	 Are you ready? So I'm going to ask her to sit and then I'm going to lure the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=45.4s	45.4	 behavior with the way that I initially trained it just to get her really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=50.5s	50.5	 focused and motivated for waving that paw. So on a visual cue and also I can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=57.4s	57.4	 have the verbal cue as well which is called wave. So I can say wave, good. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=63.6s	63.6	 when I'm first training a behavior I'll say wave and then do the hand signal so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=68.4s	68.4	 they can learn the verbal cue but then when I'm asking for the behavior I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 both at the same time because otherwise if the dog is super fast they're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=78.4s	78.4	 to be waving when I've said the cue and then I'm waving at them after they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 already waved. So I find it much more helpful to say wave as at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=90.7s	90.7	 do both. Okay and then just make sure they know just the visual and and the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=96.6s	96.6	 verbal. Okay before I fill you up with treats free what I'm going to do is send
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 her to the the mat give her a treat for that. So I'm keeping a high rate of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=108.1s	108.1	 reinforcement for all the other stuff she's doing in between like waiting for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=112.2s	112.2	 me to shut up and waiting for me to move away and this is going to make her more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=117.4s	117.4	 likely to want to wave when I'm at a distance like this. Make sure I'm still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 in the shot but you can see the wave wasn't very wasn't very pretty and now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 she's sitting right where we usually do the wave. So for dogs they think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=133.9s	133.9	 well not that they think but for all animals they don't generalize well and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 the cue has to do with the environment so she's trying to make the cue how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=145.5s	145.5	 it's supposed to be by getting right where she's supposed to be to do the cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=149.2s	149.2	 So by having a mat or a couch or the end of a carpet to help them understand that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=156.4s	156.4	 the location is part of the cue and this is part of the cue that this location to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=161.9s	161.9	 it's a little crutch to help her learn to do the behavior at a distance. So even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 if the behavior looks crappy that one looks good but you see how she came
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 forward I'm just going to click and then feed her in the position and then make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=175.1s	175.1	 it easier for her. So you don't have to make training harder and harder otherwise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 dogs can lose motivation to want to work. I'm trying to break the treat into a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=185.5s	185.5	 smaller treat. It was a little big. My nose always runs when I'm filming. Okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=191.3s	191.3	 super embarrassing. Oh gosh. Okay so she's copying my arm movements that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=197.2s	197.2	 why she lifted up her little paw. Are you ready? Another thing I'm going to do is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=202.1s	202.1	 mark her not offering behaviors. She said I need to get to that ham. There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=210.1s	210.1	 Okay. Wave. Good. Now I'm just going to be quiet and try to get a couple of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=220.6s	220.6	 repetitions that look good. She said you're too far away right now. Good. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 Wave. Good. I'm going to wait for her to get back onto the platform and what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=244.2s	244.2	 could also work on free is just being in a sit-stay at a distance from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=250.3s	250.3	 Because now she's offering a down. She says if I could just get close enough I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=257.3s	257.3	 could get them. Okay here we go. Are you ready? Good. She got it. Ready? That's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=271.6s	271.6	 awfully cute. Wave. Good. Good. Wave. Good. Good. Good. Hold on. Hold on. I'm just getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=287.3s	287.3	 ready here. There we go. Ready? Wave. Good. Good. And because she keeps jumping off of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 this I might try on the couch first. Epic-y. Jump up. Good. See if I can get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=302.4s	302.4	 more distance away from her using the precipice. She can jump down. Go jump up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=308.6s	308.6	 And I'm going to move this mat so it's not so confusing for her. Ready? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=315.5s	315.5	 That's right. She's like how do I wave and come forwards on this precipice? Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=325.4s	325.4	 I'm going to try from further away and then I'm going to make it easy again. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=330.8s	330.8	 there she didn't do it as precisely but I'm going to come close to her and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=336.7s	336.7	 get that precision back. So you want to work on one criterion at a time. So if I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=344.2s	344.2	 want precision I'm going to work from close by and if I want to work on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=348.1s	348.1	 distance I'm going to mark things that I don't think look so pretty. But if I work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=354.2s	354.2	 on the both at the same time that I can go back and fix the precision so she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=361.3s	361.3	 more likely to do it precisely from a distance. Epic-y. Go out. Sit. Wave. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73KalYf7dyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=370.0s	370.0	 Whoopsies. Almost fell off. Epic-free. Ready Epic? Go jump up. Sit. Wave. Good.
