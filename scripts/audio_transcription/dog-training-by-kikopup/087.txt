https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlUiFlzawpk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=88&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I like to use frisbee flips to reinforce heel work because it's a nice reinforcement placement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlUiFlzawpk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=88&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 Tight. Up. Drop. Tight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlUiFlzawpk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=88&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 So you teach the dog to leave the toy at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlUiFlzawpk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=88&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 Up. Drop. Go legs. Heel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlUiFlzawpk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=88&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Up. Good. Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlUiFlzawpk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=88&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 And then you get rid of the toy completely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlUiFlzawpk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=88&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 And then say up. And then the dog can get it.
