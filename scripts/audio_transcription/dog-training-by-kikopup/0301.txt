https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi guys, I wanted to show you how I teach the behavior of going from a down into a bow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=8.5s	8.5	 for dogs that just aren't getting it any other way. You need a nice soft couch that the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=13.8s	13.8	 feels comfortable laying down on and what you do is while they're in the down position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=19.4s	19.4	 you simply pull the treat over the edge of the couch and click any back end movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 What you're looking for is the dog is going to start raising their bum into the air as they reach for the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 Now Kiko's got a very good, very long neck. So here we go, up there, awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 Now you want to feed the dog in the position unless the dog stands up. So if the dog stands up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 you can just cue the dog to lay down again. Awesome. But if they're keeping their bum in the air,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 you can click and feed the dog with their bum in the air. So you're clicking the movement of getting into the bow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 and you can click and reinforce the dog for staying in the bow. Awesome. Good girl, Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 So I like to add duration right from the start so that the dog doesn't think it's just a movement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 of getting into the bow and laying down unless that's the trick that you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 Ready, Kiko?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 When the dog is reliably getting into the bow position when you move your hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 then you can start to add your verbal cue. So you can say, bravo. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 And I don't like to use the cue bow because I like to use the cue down for the position of laying down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 and they can sound very similar. So curtsy is another one that my friend uses. Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 Kiko. Bravo. Awesome. And down. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 Tug bravo. Splash bravo. All down. Good. Splash bravo. Tug bravo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiJh8njkMM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=302&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 Tug down. Splash down. All bravo. All down. Tug bravo. Splash bravo.
