https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, this is just a quick tip video for proofing a stay with the distraction of walking around your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=6.1s	6.1	 Now if you were just to walk around your puppy or dog without any prior training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=10.8s	10.8	 most dogs will get up as soon as you get behind your dog. They'll get up to see where you went.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=16.3s	16.3	 So instead of just walking around your dog, I suggest breaking it up into small steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=21.7s	21.7	 So the way that I like to train it first is to make it really easy for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=26.8s	26.8	 So you ask your dog to sit, you click and treat, and then you click and treat for every step that you take,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 and you keep your hand right in front of your dog so it doesn't give them a reason to turn around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 Now if you have a very shy dog or a dog that's worried about spatial issues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 they might be nervous about you going behind them, so don't go all the way around yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=46.7s	46.7	 You could just take steps to the side,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=48.7s	48.7	 so you're stepping to the side like this, and then around to the other side,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=53.5s	53.5	 to help build your dog's confidence if they're worried about you going behind them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 For some dogs it's easier if they're in a sit, and for others it's easier when they're in a down for you to go around them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=65.5s	65.5	 So once you've achieved the step of being able to go around them while your hand is kind of out in front like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=71.7s	71.7	 good job. Then you can start to give less and less treats as you make your way around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=83.3s	83.3	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 And now I'm not going to have my hand right in front of his face,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=92.1s	92.1	 so I'm going to go around like this, and just as I get to the back part,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=96.5s	96.5	 I'm going to reach around and put the treats between his paws like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=100.1s	100.1	 So he's anticipating the food coming to him rather than him having to get up to get the food from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=109.1s	109.1	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=114.1s	114.1	 So there he got up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 I'm simply going to lure him back into the position, and he did go to get a treat that was on the floor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=121.2s	121.2	 and then make it a little bit easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=123.7s	123.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 And now I'm going to release him. Halo free. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n6LIEOkWxk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=243&pp=iAQB&t=130.9s	130.9	 Sit. Now we're going to practice with a sit. Good job.
