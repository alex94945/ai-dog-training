https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 today to not only bring you the much awaited video of how to teach your dog to shake their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=10.1s	10.1	 head no, but it's also going to be a contest. There will be three winners and each winner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=14.9s	14.9	 will get a prize. And considering that I'm a painter, the prize will be you send me a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 photo of your dog online and I will do an ink sketch of that photo and send it to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=26.8s	26.8	 in the mail. So the first three video responses to my video filming their dog shaking their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 head no, get an ink sketch of their dog and here's an example of what your sketch could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=40.4s	40.4	 look like. An ink sketch of your dog from your photo. I'm not going to frame it for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 you, you're going to have to frame it yourself. This is to motivate you. They are really cool,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=53.4s	53.4	 really artsy-fartsy. So the rules of this competition are the dog isn't shaking their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 head because you put water in their ear, they're not shaking their head because they're sneezing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=63.2s	63.2	 and they're not shaking their head because you're luring them with a piece of food. Your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=66.6s	66.6	 dog is shaking their head by some form of a cool hands-free technique or the technique
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=72.8s	72.8	 that I'm going to show you in a second. Another rule is if for some reason the video didn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 upload to YouTube and someone beat you because of some annoying YouTube problem, write me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 a note and we'll see what we can do. Step one, get your dog to target a post-it note.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=99.9s	99.9	 How do you get this to happen? You can either just show them the note and when they go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=104.9s	104.9	 sniff it, click and treat, or you can put it, if you want to cheat, put a treat underneath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=110.8s	110.8	 the post-it note. As they get to smell it, click and give them the treat. Good job. Ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=122.2s	122.2	 slash touch, touch. Nice case. So next step, try to get a post-it note on your leg. Keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 a touch. There you go. So next step, dog is in between two cushions and there's targets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=148.8s	148.8	 on each side. So I'm going to tell her target, good, and feed her off of the other one. Target,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 good, feed her off the other one. Now I'm going to tell her target that one, feed her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=161.3s	161.3	 off the other. Another way of doing it is having the targets on objects. So, slash target,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=170.2s	170.2	 good girl. Target, good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 girl. Basically, the concept is they don't know which one to touch so they keep going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=194.3s	194.3	 back and forth because they're two. That's what you're going to start clicking for. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=202.7s	202.7	 girl. And I'm feeding the position too. So, good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=216.5s	216.5	 Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good. Good. Great dog. Good. Nice. What's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 up? Good girl. Good job. Then the trick to getting them to use without the target is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=230.5s	230.5	 to ask them to sit in front of the thing and click them for turning their head but not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=253.3s	253.3	 actually touching the target. Whoops. Isn't that scary? Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=261.3s	261.3	 Okay. So, now, I'm going to get her a little bit. You can either move the objects back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=267.1s	267.1	 or bring the dog more forwards and your dog's probably going to want to get up and turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=278.2s	278.2	 towards the object. So, click them before they think to do that and be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=285.4s	285.4	 And be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=309.7s	309.7	 And girl all done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=315.5s	315.5	 And girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=318.5s	318.5	 And girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=322.5s	322.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=326.5s	326.5	 Keep up, targets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=570&pp=iAQB&t=327.5s	327.5	 And girl.
