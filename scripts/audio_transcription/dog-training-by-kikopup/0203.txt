https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=7.4s	7.4	 and how we can empower ourselves by self-isolating and the benefit is you get to wear your pajamas

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=19.9s	19.9	 I'm a dog trainer by the way, and everybody knows, or at least I hope they know, that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=24.8s	24.8	 you can't change your dog's behavior unless you change your own behavior and the same

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 We are able to change the future by changing our own behavior and it might seem a little

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=45.7s	45.7	 can change our own futures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=48.2s	48.2	 By staying inside and staying at the right distance from people, we can prevent ourselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=54.4s	54.4	 from getting sick, which is quite amazing and quite empowering in my opinion because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=60.4s	60.4	 not only are you affecting your own future, but you're affecting the future of other people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=65.4s	65.4	 if you were to perhaps stand too close to someone and they're telling you a story and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=72.3s	72.3	 they say, pfft, too loud and some saliva splatters on your face and you're like, whoa, dude,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=78.3s	78.3	 that wasn't cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=80.1s	80.1	 And then suddenly you have this person spit all over you and then you might feel great,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=86.7s	86.7	 but then maybe you make your grandmother sick and then you would feel terrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dbzPoB7AKk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=204&pp=iAQB&t=90.5s	90.5	 So our behavior is extremely important and so staying at home unless you have an important
