https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 It makes it easier to teach your puppy to go in his crate or pen and relax or lay down if you've already worked on a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=14.3s	14.3	 Now I'm going to put the bed inside the pen that he hasn't worked with yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=18.6s	18.6	 Now I've worked with a crate with him before but this is a new pen that we've just got and I want to teach him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=24.7s	24.7	 that it's the same concept. So putting the bed in there really helps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=28.8s	28.8	 Step one throw a treat into the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=32.1s	32.1	 The first step is throwing a treat into the pen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 clicking and reinforcing your puppy for going into the pen or crate and then continuing to click and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=41.6s	41.6	 reinforce your puppy for staying in there. You might have to click quite quickly or say yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=46.4s	46.4	 quite quickly and throw a treat in there to keep your puppy in there. If your puppy thinks to come out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 just let him and if you see that your puppy doesn't want to go into the crate or pen to get the treat that means he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=57.5s	57.5	 has some concern about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=58.8s	58.8	 So one thing you can do is take the top off the crate if it's one of those plastic crates or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 take the top of the pen or simply work on the bed more before putting the bed into the crate because that will give your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=70.1s	70.1	 puppy more confidence about going into the small space that he's unsure about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=74.5s	74.5	 What you don't want to do is block your puppy from coming out because that can teach the puppy that once he's in there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=80.6s	80.6	 he might get trapped by you and it might make him more concerned about going in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=84.6s	84.6	 So just let your puppy come out and let him build his confidence on his own about going in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=89.5s	89.5	 Are you ready? Puppy free! Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=92.3s	92.3	 Mark and feed your puppy for staying in the pen for 15 to 30 seconds and then use a release cue like free or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=99.3s	99.3	 release to mean they can come out. So I'm gonna say free and if he doesn't think to come out I could lure him out or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 make a pop pop pop pop a little enticing noise to get him to come out and then I'm gonna mark and feed him a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=111.7s	111.7	 for listening to come out of his pen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=114.6s	114.6	 Step 2. Pretend to throw a treat into the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=118.2s	118.2	 After repeating step one multiple times you can then pretend to throw a treat into the crate and as the puppy goes in to look for the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=125.9s	125.9	 mark and then give him multiple treats clicks and treats for staying in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=133.5s	133.5	 If your puppy doesn't think to lay down you can lure your puppy into the down position. Free! Get it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=140.6s	140.6	 By just holding a treat down like this or working on the down behavior before you add them together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=147.3s	147.3	 The first few times that you pretend to throw a treat into the crate on the next time that you repeat the behavior I suggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=153.2s	153.2	 actually throwing a treat because puppies are extremely smart and they'll quickly figure out that you didn't actually throw a treat in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=159.9s	159.9	 so they won't go in as you pretend to throw the treat. So if that happens you can do other techniques like putting the treat in through the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=166.9s	166.9	 back of the crate or dropping the treat in from the top. Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=173.7s	173.7	 Hey Lofree! Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 If at any time your puppy offers going into the crate on his own mark it and reinforce it because it's a wonderful behavior for a puppy to offer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 If you're training something else where maybe you're teaching your dog to paw at you if they offer that without you asking then it's a big deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=192.5s	192.5	 but if it's something calm and wonderful like going into the crate and laying down I would just mark and reinforce the puppy offering without even being asked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=205.3s	205.3	 The next step is turning the throwing gesture into a pointing gesture. Are you ready? So I'm going to pretend like I'm throwing but I have a pointing finger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=213.2s	213.2	 and I'm going to click and reinforce him for going in there. Good job! Once your puppy is reliably responding to the pointing gesture you can add your verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 So you can say go in your crate or go to bed or whatever it is just before you then point at the crate. Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=229.6s	229.6	 So I'm going to say go in your crate and then I'm going to point click and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 Step four add a verbal cue. It's not necessary to phase out the hand signal but if you wanted to do that you can say go in your crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=244.4s	244.4	 and click and reinforce your puppy for going in without doing the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=248.1s	248.1	 If at any point your puppy doesn't go in when you say go in your crate you can revert back to pointing to mean go in the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=254.9s	254.9	 Good job! Teach the puppy the door isn't the cue to come out. It's really important to teach your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 to have the door opened and closed in training sessions rather than just seeing what might happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=266.9s	266.9	 So I suggest closing the door clicking and reinforcing or you can even reinforce through the roof
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=273.3s	273.3	 so that the puppy learns that when the door is closed you can still have access inside like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=278.5s	278.5	 Good job! And then opening the door and marking and reinforcing the puppy for staying down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=287.5s	287.5	 So you might want to feed the treats low like this so that the puppy stays in the down position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=292.7s	292.7	 while in there rather than thinking to pop up when the door opens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=298.5s	298.5	 By teaching the puppy that the door isn't the signal to come out but your release cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 then you have a puppy that when you open the door they're not struggling to get out of the door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoYc4VZCOg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=247&pp=iAQB&t=309.9s	309.9	 as you're opening it which can end in some frustration behaviors. Hey pupsie!
