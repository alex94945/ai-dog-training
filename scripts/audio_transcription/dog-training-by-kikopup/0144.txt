https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone! I was about to work with my little puppy on teaching him to go into his crate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 but then another issue arose and I thought I would address it in this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=10.4s	10.4	 If I give this little puppy over here a treat, like oh now he's going to be perfect, but if I give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=15.7s	15.7	 Epic a treat over here, he'll rush over and go right into her face and he's been doing that with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 my other dogs too because I haven't yet worked on them taking turns like this. So he's actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 doing really well now that we're making a video, but basically, here you go,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=36.9s	36.9	 as you saw the problem is if I give her a treat he comes in and thinks it's for him. So he's actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=42.9s	42.9	 doing really well now. The first few days that I had him, when I had novelty treats he was so excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=49.4s	49.4	 he just couldn't help himself. So one of the reasons he's actually doing a lot better is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=54.2s	54.2	 because I've been giving him a variety of different treats and making sure that he's had a large meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=60.1s	60.1	 So for breakfast he got a large meal before we did any training with different novelty treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=65.7s	65.7	 like this. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to reach for Epic good and reinforce him for staying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=71.8s	71.8	 where he is. If it's really difficult to begin with I'm going to do it both at the same time like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 and I actually have a video on this starring my other little border collie, Halo, when he was a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 puppy and it's called Taking Turns Taking Treats. It's a great impulse control game. So I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 mark him good for watching her get a treat. Now he's sitting down so if he's standing up it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=100.1s	100.1	 whole different picture. So as he turns around good and when I got him someone had obviously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 reinforced him for sitting for treats which is perfectly cool but if he's standing up it's a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=115.2s	115.2	 whole other picture because dogs will generally gravitate wherever they want to go when they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 standing up so I can practice moving around giving them treats. Good you see how he went for it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 Good good good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=141.3s	141.3	 and if he were to go and mess with her I can always block him with my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 not to be intimidating but just to prevent him harassing her for her treat. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 Good. Now in the down position. Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=192.6s	192.6	 Good. That one he's actually really good. I thought he was going to try and take her treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz9Q11qx8es&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=145&pp=iAQB&t=198.1s	198.1	 Good job. And in the sit position again. Get it. Good boy.
