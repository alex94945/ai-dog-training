https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 Now I learned about the chin rest about 13 years ago from my mentor Kyle Rayon and I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=18.1s	18.1	 counter conditioning and free shaping in the beginning of their lesson if they have a fearful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 dog that doesn't really like being touched because it involves knowing when to move on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=28.1s	28.1	 to something that's more difficult for the dog and when to decrease criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=32.4s	32.4	 So the method that I use is luring and encouraging the dog to come into your space first rather
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 than reaching for your dog to put your hand under their chin like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 So you hold the treat and you let the dog eat it and then you back away from the dog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=63.2s	63.2	 If you have a shy dog you don't have to move as quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=74.5s	74.5	 You can also throw a treat away from you to reset the dog to come towards you to put their

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 You can also have treats where you don't put your hand under your dog's chin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=90.4s	90.4	 For some dogs when you throw the treat you can make the dog too excited so you're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=94.3s	94.3	 to have to just reset the dog by backing away from the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 Very exciting huh?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1XFsV18qqQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=288&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 You want to also start feeding your dog in a calm manner so you're going to lower the
