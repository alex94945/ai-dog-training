https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=4.0s	4.0	 And the truth of the matter is, you start training your dog the moment you get your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 Every behavior the dog does has a consequence, whether you like it or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 And when you're conscious of what those consequences are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 and whether they're increasing the behavior or decreasing the behavior,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 somehow the dog has been reinforced for that way of being,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 and so it's actually the trainer's fault that the dog doesn't want to eat the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 or doesn't want to go through the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 You've got to reinforce the behaviors you like and interrupt and prevent the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 from doing the behaviors you dislike so that they're not reinforced and continue.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 even inside the uterus puppies are learning, through the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 You can start to train your dog with food the moment your dog finds food reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 As you can see here, this five-week-old foster puppy is finding food very reinforcing,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 this means that the treat is not reinforcing to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMGJBxRtBw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=422&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 Try using a variety of different food to see which one is the most reinforcing to your dog.
