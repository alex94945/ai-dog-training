https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody! This video is on the topic of whether or not you should have your dog sleep in your bed with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=5.2s	5.2	 There are a few things to consider before inviting your dog into your bed, and I'm going to go over each of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=10.4s	10.4	 One is the size of your bed and how tall it is. The second is the size of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 The third is whether it will affect your health, and the fourth is whether it will affect the dog's health and behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 The size of the bed matters because if there's just not enough space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 it's not a feasible idea to have your dog in the bed where you're competing for space or someone's getting pushed out of the bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 Now, it's also extremely important as to how tall your bed is because if you have one of those super tall beds and a hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 wood floor, it can actually be a very dangerous situation for your dog to be jumping out of the bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 because of their wrists and they're jumping off the bed onto a hard surface over time that can cause injury.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=48.5s	48.5	 So if you do have a tall bed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=50.4s	50.4	 I suggest putting down some type of non-slip mat where the dog jumps off of the bed or perhaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 investing in some stairs for your dog to climb to get into your bed. If you have an extremely small dog like a toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=63.3s	63.3	 dog that's four or five pounds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 I really don't suggest that a dog that size should jump off of a tall bed onto the floor because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=71.8s	71.8	 injuries can happen. The next category is the size of the dog. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=77.1s	77.1	 if you have an extremely large dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=79.4s	79.4	 it's obviously going to take up a lot of your bed and if you have an extremely small dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 there's also the risk that you can hurt your dog in the night
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 or another dog can sit on top of the small dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 So for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=92.8s	92.8	 if you had a small little Chihuahua under the covers and then your Great Dane wants to lay on top of the covers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 doesn't know the little dogs under there, there's that thing to consider as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=103.2s	103.2	 One way I got around it because I do have little dogs and big dogs is teaching the little dogs to only
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 sleep on one side of the bed under the covers and then all the other dogs can sleep on the other side of the bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=114.6s	114.6	 But still there is the risk that things could go wrong. So you have to keep that in mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=120.3s	120.3	 The third factor to consider is your health. Now if you're allergic to your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=124.5s	124.5	 it's probably not a good idea to sleep in bed with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=128.1s	128.1	 But it's also important to understand that if you have allergies to pollen and dust, the dog's coats are kind of like a swiffer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 collecting all these allergens when they lay on the floor or run around outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=139.3s	139.3	 So when you sleep with your dog in your bed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=141.6s	141.6	 it's kind of like sleeping with a used swiffer that has dust and pollen all stuck in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=147.5s	147.5	 So there are a couple things you can do to reduce the risks of your allergies, which is to wash your sheets frequently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=155.4s	155.4	 So I am allergic to pollen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=158.3s	158.3	 So I wash my sheets every other day and I make sure that my bed is always made,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 especially with the pillow covered so that when my terrier lays on my bed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=167.1s	167.1	 he's not laying on the actual pillow where I'm going to put my head, but it's covered with the over layer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=173.3s	173.3	 Another thing you can do is keep your floors extremely clean because that's most likely where your dog's coat is going to pick up a lot of dust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=179.7s	179.7	 And you can also groom and bathe your dog frequently to reduce the amount of allergens in their coat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=185.5s	185.5	 but you don't want to overdo it where it's unhealthy for your dog's coat and skin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=189.9s	189.9	 It really depends on the dog and the person as to whether the dog is going to increase your quality of sleep or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=195.3s	195.3	 decrease your quality of sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=196.7s	196.7	 There are some dogs that go out like a light and they sleep the entire night in the same position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=201.6s	201.6	 making a very soothing, snoring sound, while there are other dogs that are up and about all night,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 changing positions, asking to go under the covers, getting too hot, coming out of the covers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=212.5s	212.5	 pushing the person away with their paws because the person's taking up too much room and all of those things are disturbing your sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 Factor number four. It's important to consider how sleeping in your bed will affect your dog's health and behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=225.6s	225.6	 It could either be really beneficial for your dog or perhaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=229.9s	229.9	 exacerbate some existing behavioral issue. So for example, if you have a dog that guards space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=236.3s	236.3	 guards his bed, and guards areas that he finds reinforcing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=241.1s	241.1	 there's a huge possibility that he will start guarding your bed. So I suggest hiring a professional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=247.9s	247.9	 trainer who doesn't use any forms of physical or psychological
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=251.5s	251.5	 intimidation to help you work with the dog in the bed situation first before actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=257.6s	257.6	 inviting your dog into the bed because there are many exercises you can work on before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 just simply inviting your dog into the bed and then in the middle of the night you find out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 uh-oh, he actually does guard the bed as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 So generally, if you're working on resource guarding of space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=275.8s	275.8	 I don't think it's a great idea to have the dog in the bed with you because what happens is you fall asleep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=281.7s	281.7	 and then when you're asleep, it's not easy to manage and prevent dog behavior from happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=287.5s	287.5	 So the best plan if you have a dog that guards space is having the dog sleep in their own dog bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 or if you have a dog that sneaks into your bed sleeping in a crate or a pen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=298.1s	298.1	 or outside of the bedroom with a baby gate so the dog doesn't rehearse guarding your bed while you're asleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=304.9s	304.9	 If you do have a dog that guards space or his bed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=307.4s	307.4	 it's important to seek professional help and create a behavior modification plan to help your dog with this issue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=314.4s	314.4	 because simply keeping your dog out of the bed is not going to make it go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=318.7s	318.7	 Your dog is going to guard his own bed or his crate or where he rests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=323.7s	323.7	 So it's important to get help and work on that issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=327.5s	327.5	 But the first step is management and preventing the dog from rehearsing the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=331.8s	331.8	 So keeping the dog out of the bed is a good first step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=334.9s	334.9	 If you don't have a dog that guards, having your dog sleep in your bed is a great way to build your relationship and bond with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwLfbkc8N24&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=224&pp=iAQB&t=341.1s	341.1	 I hope you found this video helpful. Don't forget to like comment and subscribe to channel Kikopup. See you later guys.
