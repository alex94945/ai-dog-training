https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone, today I'm going to show you how you can proof a stay with the distraction of toys using positive reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Are you ready pup-pups?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 Ask your dog to get into the position, halo down, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 And then you're going to present the toy in a very non-exciting way, so just holding the toy up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 And as you show your dog the toy, you're going to click and treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 So you click as you show the toy and then go to feed your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 If you have a helper, it's easier and you can work from a distance so the helper can hold the toy out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 and you can click and feed your dog for staying in the position as the person shows the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 If you take a toy out and your dog stops eating food, it means the toy is too exciting for the exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 So choose a lower value toy or maybe your dog doesn't have a lower value toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 and you can use something like an old pair of socks to first play this game before moving on to using toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 You can also have someone holding the toy at a distance from your dog, maybe from across the room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 and you can work on marking and feeding your dog for seeing the toy across the room at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 if you have a dog that is completely toy obsessed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 If your dog is successful with this, you can start to increase criteria and delay when you click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 So I'm going to put the toy down and instead of just clicking immediately as I put the toy down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 I'm going to put it down a couple of times before I click and feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 Now the next step he already did, which is I'm going to do this distraction and I'm going to wait for him to look at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 and I'm going to click and reinforce him for doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 So he doesn't think that if there's a distraction while he's staying, he has to stare at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 If your dog doesn't think to look at you, it could be that the distraction is too exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 but also that he might not know to look at you so you can use your kissy noise or attention noise or his name
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 and say that. So while he's looking over there, I'm going to make a kissy noise, click and treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 and then see if he thinks to do it on his own after a couple of times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 Now I'm going to throw the toy and I'm going to click as I throw the toy and give him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 If at any point your dog gets up, simply lure the dog back into the position, move your hand away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 click your dog for staying and then drastically reduce criteria to something very easy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 for example holding the toy in a very boring manner and clicking your dog for staying there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 Hello!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Yes! That was good! Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 A squeaky toy can be one of the hardest distractions for many dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 so I suggest squeaking the toy as you feed a treat at first because most dogs might jump up as they hear the squeak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 Then you can start to delay when you give the treat. So you're going to squeak and then give the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 And I'm holding the toy in a very casual manner. I'm not getting the dog super excited about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 I'm just squeaking and then going to feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 If the dog were to get up, I could get the dog to lay down again and then practice squeaking and feeding at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 Like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 He's doing so good I can move on to the next step which is squeaking a lot and moving the toy around like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 And then I'm going to see if he might think to look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 This distraction is going to be too much for Halo and he's going to get up and then I can show you what to do if your dog gets up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 So I'm going to stand up and squeak this and as you see he got up so I'm going to lure him back into the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 Halo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 And then I'm going to lure him into the down and it's a little tricky because there are other dogs there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=269.0s	269.0	 Move my hand away, click and feed and now I'm just going to squat and squeak the toy. Click and feed him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 And now I'm going to stand up and squeeze it while I'm next to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=288.0s	288.0	 Good job!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 Good job!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=333.0s	333.0	 encourage your dog up, mark and reinforce your dog for getting up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4tfOdTvnE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=198&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 Are you ready? Halo free! Good job!
