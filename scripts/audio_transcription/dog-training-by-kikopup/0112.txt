https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, I'm going to be doing a training session with my little pup Cloud here on working on the rear end awareness exercise and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=8.4s	8.4	 Utilizing it to work on heel work. So most people either free shape the rear end. Well, not most people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 I don't know what they do these days, but some people free shape the exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 So the dog learns to turn around the object on their own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=23.3s	23.3	 as a as a thinking game and for their for their body and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 Other people will use their body as the cue to turn the dog like this, which is great for the front position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=35.8s	35.8	 But if you haven't yet worked on the dog just turning for a lure or free shaping the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 Turning at your side then it's gonna it's gonna be like a new behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=47.6s	47.6	 So along with teaching them to turn in a complete circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=51.6s	51.6	 I usually like them to be able to happily turn in a complete circle and a little bit more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=58.7s	58.7	 before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=59.9s	59.9	 fading the platform and using the exercise for training things like backwards weaving or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 obedience turns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=69.1s	69.1	 So one thing to do is start to teach the dog to just follow the lure when you're holding it like this. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 And you really want to see a nice smooth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Backfoot movement so that they're not jumping or hopping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 And their legs are moving nicely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 Side-stepping then when you can get the dog to turn all the way around on the platform easily like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=93.6s	93.6	 You can start to hold the treat further away from the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=96.8s	96.8	 Especially if you have a very short dog like I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 so I'm gonna hold the treat up here and see if he might think to turn and I can start the movement like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 This and then move the treat away as he's moving and see if I might get a moment of him moving without the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 So you can see he's also waving at me. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 He's trying to figure out what I want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=121.3s	121.3	 And so what I'm gonna do is continually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=124.2s	124.2	 Reinforce him for doing the correct behavior and try to make it so that he doesn't make too many errors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=131.6s	131.6	 So that's why I keep going back to putting my hand near his face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 To make sure he knows it's the same behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=139.3s	139.3	 Okay, here we go. He said what if I jump for it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=143.1s	143.1	 Good job, and you can see I'm turning with him at my side. So he's already set up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 So that he's next to me because sometimes it's really hard with the dog like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=154.6s	154.6	 To then try to turn them to being at your side at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=159.1s	159.1	 So while he's eating a treat here after turning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=162.8s	162.8	 Like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=164.8s	164.8	 I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=166.3s	166.3	 Could just feed him and then get next to him before I then turn him and some dogs find that much easier. Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=174.3s	174.3	 Awesome, and then you do the same behavior on the other side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=177.9s	177.9	 So I've been getting little handfuls of chicken because he's so small. I'm gonna get another handful and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=183.9s	183.9	 Then after this handful we'll be done. So I was actually gonna show you the right side, but instead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=189.6s	189.6	 Because I didn't anticipate using up the treats, but it's because I'm also talking I'm going to show you how to fade the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=197.5s	197.5	 Object so once the dog has warmed up with turning next to you and they're doing it reliably or turning in front of you like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=204.7s	204.7	 And he's not really doing it reliably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 But what I can do instead is see how he's reliably turning when I hold the treat in front of his face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 I can take away the platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=215.5s	215.5	 And then I'm gonna make it super super easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=218.3s	218.3	 So I'm just gonna turn a teeny weeny bit mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 So I'm gonna turn him like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=226.6s	226.6	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=229.3s	229.3	 Remove him from the platform with a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=234.8s	234.8	 Feed him a treat next to me like this and then give a little turn and mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=241.7s	241.7	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=249.4s	249.4	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=254.3s	254.3	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=260.5s	260.5	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=263.7s	263.7	 Turn good turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=268.1s	268.1	 Good come on back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 And turn good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=273.9s	273.9	 We're almost out of treats so I will switch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=278.4s	278.4	 With epic the next step i'm going to work with epic my little chihuahua who's one year old and i'm going to fade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=285.4s	285.4	 The treat lore and see if she might offer the behavior as me turning while she's in the heel position to cue the turning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=291.6s	291.6	 So she does have the cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 To turn on a verbal cue when on the platform and also you can do something like fading the platform with a little non-slip mat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 That some border collie has has bitten a piece out of but it's the one that epic likes the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=306.9s	306.9	 To stand on because it's very uh sturdy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=309.9s	309.9	 I tried with something more slippery and she didn't want to have her feet on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=313.4s	313.4	 So what i'm going to do is begin by luring her like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=316.7s	316.7	 And then i'm going to take my hand away and see if she might offer the same behavior now if she was a little skew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=323.1s	323.1	 I could use the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=324.7s	324.7	 To feed her in a nice heel position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=327.5s	327.5	 So i'm just doing tiny little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=329.6s	329.6	 Okay, so she got skew there so I could lure her back and feed her nice and straight like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 Good job. So now i'm going to go back to luring and ask for more more turns in the heel position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=342.0s	342.0	 Good job. And then when there's no treat for the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=345.9s	345.9	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=347.0s	347.0	 The next repetition i'm not going to ask for so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=350.8s	350.8	 So when the treat's there she has to do more and when there's no treat she doesn't have to do as much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=357.9s	357.9	 Awesome, so if you've been turning your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=361.6s	361.6	 Like this where their head's out to the side what can happen is that um, they'll keep their head out to the side when they turn instead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=369.3s	369.3	 Looking up at you or facing forward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=371.6s	371.6	 So one way to get rid of that is to hold the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=374.7s	374.7	 On you and get the dog to learn to turn while looking at you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=379.3s	379.3	 So first you get the turning like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=381.9s	381.9	 And then you add criteria of the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=385.3s	385.3	 Um turning and keeping their head facing towards you which is a different behavior. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=390.4s	390.4	 But I think it looks nicer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=393.1s	393.1	 And they keep their body straighter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=396.1s	396.1	 She's like shut up and train me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=398.5s	398.5	 Stop talking to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=400.7s	400.7	 So she did really well, so i'm going to remove that good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=404.4s	404.4	 And now do it without so i'm going to get her into the nice position over here whoop like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=410.7s	410.7	 And then i'm going to pretend to have a treat here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=413.9s	413.9	 And get a little turn and she said oh are we sitting now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=420.3s	420.3	 Ready i'm gonna have a treat and turn her so that she's not sitting ready turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=426.7s	426.7	 Epic turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=428.5s	428.5	 And I am going in a little circle to prevent her sitting as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=433.2s	433.2	 Because it was easy for her to sit. Um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-Tf2hA2i4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=113&pp=iAQB&t=438.0s	438.0	 When I was standing in the same spot
