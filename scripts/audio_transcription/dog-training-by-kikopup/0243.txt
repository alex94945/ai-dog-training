https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, in this video I'm going to show you a fun game you can play with your puppy or adult dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 if they've started to have an aversion to having their harness put over their head and it touches their ears for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=12.5s	12.5	 So my puppy started to show these signs that when I brought the harness towards him that he seemed to back away and not want to have it on his head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 So instead of first working with the harness, I worked on this fun game where he put his head into an object
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=26.5s	26.5	 that would then rub against his face in the same way that a harness would.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=30.5s	30.5	 So instead of putting the harness onto him, I had him put his nose into the object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=36.5s	36.5	 So I have this cute little thing that I got at IKEA in the children's department. It's for toys, for playing with children.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=44.5s	44.5	 But you could use a cardboard box or whatever, just not a plastic bag obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=50.5s	50.5	 You don't want to have your puppy putting their head in a plastic bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 Also you don't want to leave out whatever it is that you've been working on because you don't want your puppy putting their head into an object while you're not there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 Okay, so the first step is simply putting a treat into the object and then letting the puppy eat the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=69.5s	69.5	 And you might want to hold onto the object so the puppy doesn't get it stuck on their head or freak out when it starts to move around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 And you can see he's a little bit nervous about that. This object is actually pretty cool because you can change the height of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 So I'm putting treats in there like that and he's just eating them out of there and gaining his confidence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=90.5s	90.5	 I can also throw a treat away and see how fast he comes back to the object to go and sniff in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=98.5s	98.5	 Good job. I'm going to make it a little bit higher and he's eating the treats in there and he seems quite confident.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=105.5s	105.5	 So now I'm not going to hold onto it anymore and I'm going to put a treat into it and tell him to go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=111.5s	111.5	 And then he can go find the treat inside that object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 Oops, I dropped a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=119.5s	119.5	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=122.5s	122.5	 Now I'm going to put a treat in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 Say go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=127.5s	127.5	 And then he's going to put his face in there and I can click and throw more treats into that object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=133.5s	133.5	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=138.5s	138.5	 Now I'm going to pretend to throw a treat in like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=141.5s	141.5	 And then when he goes to put his head in, I'm going to click and then feed him inside of the object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=149.5s	149.5	 And go back a step to him just getting a treat in there to make it easier for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=153.5s	153.5	 Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=157.5s	157.5	 Now there's no treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=159.5s	159.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=169.5s	169.5	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=170.5s	170.5	 You can then add a verbal cue. I like to use the cue put it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yc5Y9HGY4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=244&pp=iAQB&t=173.5s	173.5	 Ready? Put it in.
