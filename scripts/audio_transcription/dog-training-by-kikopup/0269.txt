https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 It's really important that dogs take treats nicely during training, otherwise they can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 bite your hand or they can get over aroused by the treat delivery and then that can kind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=12.5s	12.5	 of interfere with the training that you're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 So I'm going to show you how to teach your dog to take treats nicely and then you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 going to do these sessions on taking treats nicely separately from your training and until
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 your dog can take treats nicely, you can deliver the treat in a way that your dog isn't going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=32.4s	32.4	 to bite your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 So the first step is choosing a time when your dog is a little bit sleepy and relaxed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 and you can see that Wish here is not in a very excitable mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=44.5s	44.5	 It's the perfect time to work on it because when she's excited, her mouth has started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=48.8s	48.8	 to get hard when I give her the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=51.3s	51.3	 So I suggest when you train this exercise that you cut the treats a little bit bigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 and you use treats that aren't messy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=61.1s	61.1	 So if you're holding a treat and little crumbs are falling off, if your dog does bite, they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=66.7s	66.7	 going to get little bits of crumbs and get reinforced for taking the treat harm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=71.1s	71.1	 So I've got some string cheese that I've cut up in pretty big pieces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 Usually I don't use such big pieces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 I've got some hot dog, some turkey hot dog and some kibble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 Now if you have a dog that is extremely excited by food, you can do something that my friend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 Sean Davies does which is use a treat that the dog doesn't really even like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=93.8s	93.8	 So by giving the dog a piece of carrot and they take it like, hmm, I don't really like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 this that much, then they get reinforced by the treat they really wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=103.3s	103.3	 So that's a great technique for starting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=106.7s	106.7	 Other great techniques are working on some impulse control and calmness first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=111.5s	111.5	 So I'm going to link in this tutorial Capture and Calmness where you feed your dog for settling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=119.1s	119.1	 and not thinking about the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=121.1s	121.1	 So when your dog is relaxed and calm and not thinking about the food, so right now I don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=127.1s	127.1	 know if Wish is still thinking about the food but it looks like she's noticed something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=130.8s	130.8	 at the window, I can say yep and then mark her by feeding her between her paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=137.4s	137.4	 So that's a really great first step to teaching your dog to be calm around food which will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 help to make their mouth less hard when taking the treat because it can also have to do with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=148.7s	148.7	 the dog's arousal level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=151.3s	151.3	 Game 1.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=153.9s	153.9	 So this game is I'm going to go and I'm going to put the treat down between her paws and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 I actually haven't played this with her so let me just line her up better so you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=165.9s	165.9	 see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 So I'm going to go and I'm going to put the treat down between her paws but if she touches
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 my hand to get it, I'm not going to let it go, I'm just going to move it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=176.5s	176.5	 If she waits for my hand to put it down then I'm going to release it and move my hand back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=181.9s	181.9	 calmly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 It's really important that you don't move fast during these exercises to calm your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=188.1s	188.1	 down around treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 You're going to move slowly and if the dog goes for your hand, you're just going to move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=193.9s	193.9	 backwards, not in like a ha ha ha you suck kind of way but in a just oh I'm not going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=201.3s	201.3	 to give it to you if you're going to take it excitedly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=208.3s	208.3	 So I have my hand down on the ground and then I'm going to release it and let her eat it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=218.4s	218.4	 It helps to put it under the dog's chin so that they don't have to lunge forwards to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=239.3s	239.3	 You could add eye contact while you wait for the dog to look at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=249.3s	249.3	 Now with some hot dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 If your dog is successful with the low value treats, you can start using higher value treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=259.4s	259.4	 If you notice your dog gets very excited, you can always take a break and wait until
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=263.4s	263.4	 your dog has relaxed to begin the training again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 Game 2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=269.2s	269.2	 So the next game is moving your hand very slowly towards your dog and then as it gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=275.2s	275.2	 there, releasing the treat if you only feel the dog's lips and tongue or very soft teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=282.2s	282.2	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=289.2s	289.2	 face rather than hold it out so that they have to snag it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 Once your dog is successful with the low value treat, then you can start using higher value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=299.2s	299.2	 treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=300.2s	300.2	 This is cheese here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=311.2s	311.2	 So I'm going to throw the cheese.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=312.2s	312.2	 That's going to make her more likely to want to take the treat hard out of my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=327.2s	327.2	 So standing up and giving the dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=331.2s	331.2	 Awesome.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=339.2s	339.2	 She thinks she's supposed to do something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=343.2s	343.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=344.2s	344.2	 In between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=346.2s	346.2	 Oh, you want to do cup, cup?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=347.2s	347.2	 Okay, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=350.2s	350.2	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=358.2s	358.2	 the treat out of your hand.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=366.2s	366.2	 Just a licking tongue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=369.2s	369.2	 Then you can put it on a cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=371.2s	371.2	 Once the behavior is reliable, that the dog is licking the treat out of your hand, then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=376.2s	376.2	 you can add the cue, lick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=380.2s	380.2	 Tug.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=392.2s	392.2	 It can take some time to train this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=394.2s	394.2	 As you saw, Tug isn't reliably licking the treat into his mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=398.2s	398.2	 Sometimes he tries to take it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=408.2s	408.2	 suggest adding the cue, lick, before you present the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=414.2s	414.2	 Lick.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=435.2s	435.2	 If you plan to click and then feed your dog a treat with your hand, I suggest that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=440.2s	440.2	 do this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=441.2s	441.2	 All you're doing is you're thinking about what position you want your dog to be in while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=447.2s	447.2	 you're training when you haven't given your dog any information yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=451.2s	451.2	 So I don't mind standing, laying down, or sitting, but I definitely do mind shuffling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=457.2s	457.2	 the feet or offering strange behaviors in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=461.2s	461.2	 So I'm going to practice seeing if she's taking the treat softly before I click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=465.2s	465.2	 So she is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=466.2s	466.2	 So next step I'm going to click and then move to feed her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=470.2s	470.2	 And she did it very nicely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=473.2s	473.2	 She's not moving around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=475.2s	475.2	 She looks great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=477.2s	477.2	 Another thing you could do is if you want your dog to stare at your eyes instead of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=480.2s	480.2	 the treats, you could wait and see if your dog would look at your eyes before you click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=485.2s	485.2	 and treat.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=488.2s	488.2	 I'm going to practice with her sitting and also standing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=492.2s	492.2	 Awesome.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=500.2s	500.2	 training anything important.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=508.2s	508.2	 Good job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=515.2s	515.2	 does make her excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=517.2s	517.2	 Now I'm going to practice with her standing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=519.2s	519.2	 So she's taking the treats a little harder in the standing position than she was in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=523.2s	523.2	 laying down position.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=531.2s	531.2	 There she almost got the treat for taking it hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=535.2s	535.2	 There you go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=553.2s	553.2	 So this time I'm going to see if she might look at me before I click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=561.2s	561.2	 Click.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=613.2s	613.2	 you're training other behaviors, you can either feed your dog in a number of ways.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=622.2s	622.2	 hand and bring it under the dog's chin and then the dog usually eats it quite nicely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46iuiZU2chc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=270&pp=iAQB&t=629.2s	629.2	 There are some dogs that scrape your hand or just slam their face into your hand to
