https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, this video is on the topic of teaching your puppy to be less excited about his dinner if he eats too fast or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=8.4s	8.4	 overexcitedly or perhaps he has a tendency to guard his dinner. Now if you have a young puppy that has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 guarding tendencies, I suggest that you go to a professional trainer that uses positive reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 to help you with your training plan in case you're not reading your puppy's signs that he's uncomfortable and the same goes for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 adult dogs. If you have an adult dog that's guarding their food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 I suggest you get help from a trainer to go over this exercise with you to work on the guarding issue because what can happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=39.1s	39.1	 is if you do too much too quickly or go too quickly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 adding criteria, you can actually make the problem worse. If you're approaching your puppy while he's eating and you're stressing him out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=49.6s	49.6	 he might actually be more stressed by this game than it having any positive effect on his behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=56.5s	56.5	 So the goal of the game is that the puppy is going to be eating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=61.4s	61.4	 his normal meal, which is a low value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=65.3s	65.3	 reinforcement. So you have to really know how to tell the difference between high value and low value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=70.4s	70.4	 So I'm going to be feeding him kibble in the bowl and then as I approach I'm going to reinforce his response of looking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 having a positive emotional response to me coming over which is lifting his head up from his meal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 and then I'm going to reinforce that with a high value treat and then let him go back to eating his meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=89.7s	89.7	 So to begin with what I'm going to do is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 show him the process of how I'm going to give him the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 because if the puppy doesn't know that you're going to give him a higher value treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=101.4s	101.4	 he might actually start eating faster as you approach and stressing out so it can kind of backfire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=107.3s	107.3	 So if you're going to feed your puppy a high value treat from your hand, you can feed your puppy from your hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 but if your pup takes the treat super hard, you might choose a treat that is not crumbly or leaving residue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=121.2s	121.2	 and then put the treat on the floor for the puppy to eat away from his food bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=125.9s	125.9	 If you have a puppy that has a tendency for guarding,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=129.7s	129.7	 I don't like to put the treat on the floor because what can happen is the puppy can start guarding the smells on the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 So you could use a dish. I'm just going to go get a dish right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 So here's my puppy's food bowl and here's the dish I can use to give him the treat, the higher value treat when I approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=147.3s	147.3	 Say the pup is taking the treats hard, I can feed the puppy out of this dish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 and if you had an extreme case in a shelter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=154.9s	154.9	 what you could do is have the dish on a long stick like a target stick and you don't even have to enter the kennel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 The puppy or dog can be eating their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 meal out of the bowl or there's no meal in the bowl and then this long target stick can come in and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 reinforce with a higher value treat or turn and put treats that aren't sticky into the bowl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 that's in the kennel with a dog. So that's a great way of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=181.6s	181.6	 protected contact so that your presence isn't going to send the dog over threshold and feel more stressed by the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 So that's why I like to use the bowl. It's very handy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Also, you can give the bowl to someone else and suddenly the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=197.3s	197.3	 you know, the picture makes more sense to the dog where if you're just working as a human being and then you switch trainers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=204.6s	204.6	 the dog can be like, hey, I don't know you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=207.6s	207.6	 So this really helps with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 generalizing if you were doing something at a shelter for example. Okay, let's get started.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 So first we're going to work with an empty bowl over here. Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=220.9s	220.9	 So that's just an empty bowl and I'm feeding the puppy like this because my puppy's not taking the treats too hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=227.9s	227.9	 But you could also feed like a horse with an open hand like that if your pup is taking treats hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=234.9s	234.9	 And the bowl. So I'm teaching the puppy to eat out of this bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=238.9s	238.9	 Now sometimes the deli meat if you're using something sticky, it will stick in the bowl and that can be a little bit stressful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=244.9s	244.9	 So if you're using a bowl, you might use a treat that is like a dry chicken jerky treat or something that doesn't crumble or leave residue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=254.9s	254.9	 So by doing this, I actually really like the book Mine by Jean Donaldson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=260.9s	260.9	 So you should read that and I'll link a I'll put a link in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=265.9s	265.9	 But there's a little difference to my training is that I don't put the high value treat into the bowl or on the floor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=272.9s	272.9	 because I found that some dogs will start to get more excited by what's in the bowl and on the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=278.9s	278.9	 So it's kind of like increasing the value of the food that they have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=282.9s	282.9	 So I like to have the higher value food to really begin with to make fast progress where the dog is like, I want what you have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 And I love it when you come over and bother me with my food because it's always in my best interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=296.9s	296.9	 OK, and you can really build that positive emotional response and use that concept of novelty coming into their space with the novelty treat when they're eating something that's not so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=309.9s	309.9	 Another thing that I wanted to mention quickly is that you can see that my puppy is pretty calm right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=314.9s	314.9	 And that's because he had a big breakfast. He had lots of play. He played with his toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=322.9s	322.9	 You know, he's been loose playing around with toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=325.9s	325.9	 Then he took a nap. And then when he woke up from the nap, he was kind of sleepy and he's full from his breakfast, which was two hours ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=332.9s	332.9	 Not full, but satisfied. And you can see his general behavior is just he's calm and relaxed around the food, which is amazing because he can get super excited by the treats that I have here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=343.9s	343.9	 which is actually roast beef, which he was having getting over excited about earlier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=348.9s	348.9	 So choosing the right time to train can really help with the training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=353.9s	353.9	 Don't do this training before a meal. Feed your puppy a meal and then do the training when your puppy's not in an excitable mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=361.9s	361.9	 OK, and hopefully you won't get into an excitable mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=364.9s	364.9	 So if you notice the pup get super excited, you can always stop and start again later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=369.9s	369.9	 So now that we've practiced giving the treat to the dog so the dog is anticipating high rewards coming from us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=377.9s	377.9	 I'm going to put some of his food in the bowl and then after he's done eating it, I'm going to invite him to get a treat from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=384.9s	384.9	 So I'm just going to go get some of his food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=393.9s	393.9	 I don't want to put too much in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=395.9s	395.9	 So I'm going to give him some of these tiny kibbles in here and he can eat those.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=401.9s	401.9	 And I'm not having him in a corner or against the wall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=405.9s	405.9	 He's out in the middle, out in the open eating his food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=408.9s	408.9	 And then when he's done or he looks up away from his food, he's going to come over for his high value treat like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=416.9s	416.9	 So I can show him that it's all done. All done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=420.9s	420.9	 And then I can point because he didn't actually finish what he was eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=423.9s	423.9	 There's still some kibbles in that bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=426.9s	426.9	 So do you see how he's anticipating something good happening for me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=429.9s	429.9	 I played this game one time about a week ago, the first day that I had him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=434.9s	434.9	 because I wasn't sure if he was eating overexcitedly because he's not had novelty treats before or if he might have a tendency to guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=443.9s	443.9	 But for me, I don't see any tendencies to guard in this puppy, just the excitement over the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=448.9s	448.9	 So there's that kibble in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=451.9s	451.9	 Now I'm going to put more of this kibble in the bowl like that and practice the approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=456.9s	456.9	 So I'm going to approach him, show him I have a better treat that he can eat, take it away and he can continue eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=463.9s	463.9	 So you might want to do a side approach where you come in like this and not come too close to the bowl if you're worried.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=471.9s	471.9	 You can also feed over the bowl as the next step where the dog is eating and then you put the bowl in front of their face to eat out of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=482.9s	482.9	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=484.9s	484.9	 If you're having a problem like this where the dog wants what you have, that's the good sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=489.9s	489.9	 So what's happening is your dog is learning that no one's coming to steal their food and that the food they're eating is not that exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=496.9s	496.9	 So you're reducing that arousal over eating their food and preventing the dog thinking that you're coming to steal their food every time you come over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=506.9s	506.9	 So what you're looking for is that slow floppy tail like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=511.9s	511.9	 You don't want it to be doing this or held high over the back. Sorry puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=516.9s	516.9	 And you don't want your puppy to stop eating and freeze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=520.9s	520.9	 What you want is just loose muscles and just a calm, happy looking pup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=525.9s	525.9	 Okay, so I'm going to get him interested in that food again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=530.9s	530.9	 If your puppy doesn't leave the food bowl, you can squat down and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=536.9s	536.9	 And see if you can recall your puppy away from the food as the first step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=541.9s	541.9	 If your pup really can't be called away from that food, I suggest using something like carrots to work on this exercise first or something that the dog is really disinterested in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=552.9s	552.9	 Or spending longer working on the food delivery around an empty bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=557.9s	557.9	 Okay, you want to eat your nummies over here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=560.9s	560.9	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=561.9s	561.9	 Now I'm going to work on that approach again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=563.9s	563.9	 So this time I'm just going to use my hand and I'm going to come over and reach in to his food bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=569.9s	569.9	 And you'll see as I walk over, he doesn't even care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=572.9s	572.9	 Good job. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=575.9s	575.9	 And then practice with this bowl for those of you who might want to use a bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=580.9s	580.9	 There you go. And because he's doing so good, I'm actually going to increase the value inside his food bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=585.9s	585.9	 So I have this dried, it's a what's it called?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=593.9s	593.9	 Freeze dried chicken. So he really likes that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=596.9s	596.9	 So now that freeze dried chicken is in the bowl with the kibble and I have the roast beef.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=602.9s	602.9	 So I'm going to come in with my bowl and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=605.9s	605.9	 And you can see he's having a hard time being called away from the chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=611.9s	611.9	 So this would be, you know, where the treats are the same value.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=615.9s	615.9	 Now I can't get him away from what he has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=617.9s	617.9	 So in this situation, what he's got is too, too reinforcing to leave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=624.9s	624.9	 And so if you see the dog acting like this, you need to choose a lower value treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=629.9s	629.9	 I really was sure that he thought the roast beef was better,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=632.9s	632.9	 but he hasn't had that chicken in quite a few days because I ran out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=636.9s	636.9	 So it was just the crumbs he's licking up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=638.9s	638.9	 So what I could do instead is clean out that bowl and practice with with using the freeze dried chicken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=647.9s	647.9	 and then some other sort of food in there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=650.9s	650.9	 So practice with a variety of different treats and foods that the puppy's eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=654.9s	654.9	 If you're really worried that your puppy is guarding or getting overexcited by different types of food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=661.9s	661.9	 So the more variety of food you use,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=663.9s	663.9	 the more your puppy is going to realize that you're not coming to steal whatever he has
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=669.9s	669.9	 and he can relax and enjoy his meal and not worry. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=674.9s	674.9	 So I'm adding some of his kibble there and there's still the residue of that chicken that I gave him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=682.9s	682.9	 So I'm going to come in and he's leaving the kibble for my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=687.9s	687.9	 because the residue of chicken is not that interesting for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=691.9s	691.9	 And now he's going back to his food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=697.9s	697.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=702.9s	702.9	 It's all done. Get your food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=706.9s	706.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=712.9s	712.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=714.9s	714.9	 Another thing that's extremely important to remember if you don't want your dog to be overexcited by their dinner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=719.9s	719.9	 is that the process of giving the dinner is going to reinforce whatever behavior they're doing before the dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=725.9s	725.9	 So if you're taking a long time to prepare the meal and the puppy's getting overexcited,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=729.9s	729.9	 then when you put the meal down, you're going to reinforce that puppy for doing whatever he did before you gave him the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=736.9s	736.9	 So if he's barking and whining, he most likely will continue to do that or jumping on your leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=741.9s	741.9	 So one thing you can do is prepare the meal while the puppy's outside or someone else is walking him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=746.9s	746.9	 And then when you see him calm and relaxing like this, you can put the food down and point at it and say, OK, go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=752.9s	752.9	 And he said, I want the roast beef, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=755.9s	755.9	 So the other thing that I see people doing with their puppies and adult dogs is asking them to sit and they say, sit, wait, wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=765.9s	765.9	 OK. And then the dog goes to the food bowl like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=769.9s	769.9	 And what generally happens is the dog then gobbles their food down as fast as they can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=775.9s	775.9	 And so I really like to teach the dog that they can be a food connoisseur and eat at a leisurely pace without stressing out that they have to get it all down as fast as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=786.9s	786.9	 So there he's chewing it nicely rather than just swallowing the kibble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=791.9s	791.9	 And if he's disinterested in the kibble, I can also pick it up and feed him from my hand like that to get him interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=799.9s	799.9	 Yeah. And now he's going to settle down eating his kibble in a nice fashion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=807.9s	807.9	 Good boy. Yeah, that was very good. That was very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=812.9s	812.9	 Another game I can play is have the bowl further away from him and reach into the bowl and feed him the high value treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=819.9s	819.9	 Good. Like that. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=822.9s	822.9	 So you might have to feed the treat at the same time like that as you mess with his food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=827.9s	827.9	 Good. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=832.9s	832.9	 And now I'm going to wait, touch his food and then feed him the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=836.9s	836.9	 Good. Awesome. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=840.9s	840.9	 And now I'm going to have the bowl closer to him like that so he's he might be tempted to eat some of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=847.9s	847.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=849.9s	849.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=852.9s	852.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=855.9s	855.9	 When he's doing really well, you can then just drop the food into the bowl like most trainers do for the resource guarding training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=863.9s	863.9	 So when you come over and they're eating their food, you can just drop the food in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=867.9s	867.9	 With my own dogs, when they're all having their meals, all seven of them, I will come by and give extra nice snacks near their bowl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=875.9s	875.9	 So I'll put the treat down on the floor next to their bowl like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=878.9s	878.9	 And he hasn't quite learned that yet. And he's eating the higher value treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=882.9s	882.9	 So it's really easy to find the yummy treat and then continue with their meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=886.9s	886.9	 And that really helps to slow everyone down when it's dinner time and there's a lot of dogs in the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=893.9s	893.9	 It's also important. I suggest if you have multiple dogs to have them at a distance from each other that they feel comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=900.9s	900.9	 A lot of people will line their dogs up where they're right next to each other when eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=904.9s	904.9	 And some of my dogs are really fine with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=907.9s	907.9	 And they really don't care because they trust that I won't let the other dogs get their meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=911.9s	911.9	 But other dogs like their privacy to eat slowly without this other dog's body right there while they're eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=917.9s	917.9	 So it really depends on your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=919.9s	919.9	 But I suggest that you do give them enough distance where they feel comfortable having their dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=927.9s	927.9	 Hey, and they get to really enjoy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb-OtOgSDM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=142&pp=iAQB&t=930.9s	930.9	 I hope you found this video helpful for your training.
