https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 For calming a dog down, you're moving the treat slowly into the dog's face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=6.4s	6.4	 So you can use calm markers associated with calmness, which I call calm markers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 So good means that I'm going to is going to predict a slow treat delivery like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 Or when the dog's settled, I might say good or yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 And I also use it for calm massage where I'm massaging the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=27.4s	27.4	 Good. Like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=29.8s	29.8	 But for exciting the dog, I'm going to use other markers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=33.2s	33.2	 And for me, the clicker is a very exciting marker for my dogs because I use it for teaching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=39.6s	39.6	 pretty active behaviors as well as the word yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=43.2s	43.2	 So I'm going to say the exciting marker and then the treat is going to move away from the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 if I need to excite the dog more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=51.3s	51.3	 Now for some dogs, you might never need to excite them like my terrier and wish I don't often need
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 to make her any more excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 When we start training, she'll start getting excited because she loves doing the behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=65.4s	65.4	 But if you were to want to excite the dog, you mark and then move to feed the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=71.6s	71.6	 So you don't even need to work on any behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=73.9s	73.9	 Your dog is just learning to enjoy the sound of the clicker and the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 No pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=79.5s	79.5	 So I'm going to click and then move away from the dog with a treat like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=85.5s	85.5	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=86.2s	86.2	 You can also pretend that you're really interested in the treats like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=92.8s	92.8	 Oh, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=95.5s	95.5	 Oh, these are these are so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=100.8s	100.8	 And you're marking and reinforcing that interest in the dog wanting a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 You can also practice throwing the treat and then marking for your dog, looking for the next treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 You can also move away from your dog if you have more space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=117.6s	117.6	 She hasn't found all the treats yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 So when the dog turns around, your movement also is exciting the dog to want to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=127.1s	127.1	 So the pressure is completely off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=129.9s	129.9	 It's a completely different picture than asking your dog sit, sit, and then the food goes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 into their face like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=137.7s	137.7	 That's not as exciting as you playing a keep away game with your own movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 The keep away with your body and keep away with the treats is really going to encourage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 the dog to want to work for the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=150.7s	150.7	 Hey guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=152.1s	152.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=153.1s	153.1	 I suggest when training any behavior that you begin with calm movements and calm treat deliveries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 And then when the dog understands the behavior and you want more speed and enthusiasm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=165.6s	165.6	 then you can quickly start to incorporate the fast exciting treat deliveries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYTZ-yqRU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=41&pp=iAQB&t=170.9s	170.9	 If your dog needs motivation or you can use toys as the reinforcers.
