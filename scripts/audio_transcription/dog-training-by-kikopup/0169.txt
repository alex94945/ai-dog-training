https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone! In this video I'm going to show a very basic example of how to fade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=5.6s	5.6	 a treat lure when training a behavior and the behavior I'm going to use is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 going around a cone. So with my little puppy Epic I've already had quite a few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=14.8s	14.8	 training sessions where I've lured her around the cone like that to the left
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 and the right. So I began the behavior by simply dropping a trail of treats so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=27.1s	27.1	 that she'd go around the cone to follow the treats and I've been reinforcing her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=31.3s	31.3	 on the ground for this behavior because she has a tendency to stand up on her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=36.5s	36.5	 back feet when following a treat as you can see. Oh! She started to offer the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=42.8s	42.8	 behavior already but after luring her around the cone like that I then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=48.8s	48.8	 pretended to get a treat lured her around and what I'm doing is I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=53.9s	53.9	 teaching her to do the behavior even though there's not a treat in my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=57.7s	57.7	 and I'm also teaching her to do the behavior with less of a hand gesture. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=62.9s	62.9	 at first my hand was going all the way around the cone like this and now my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=68.4s	68.4	 hand is just going over the top of the cone like this and she's doing more work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=73.6s	73.6	 than my hand is doing and then I'm going to try and get to the point where I can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 just do a finger flick and pick her up on the other side of the cone like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 Good job! So even holding a treat I can go like that and then present the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 over here. Good job! And the time that I'm clicking is when she goes around the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=95.7s	95.7	 cone and then you can mark the movement of the dog moving around the cone and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=100.5s	100.5	 then you can feed in the direction they're going so that you don't get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 dog that when they hear a marker or you've said good job to them as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 they're doing something that they stop in their tracks which can happen like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=113.4s	113.4	 when you're teaching leg weaving the dog weaves your leg and then stops at your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 side to say hey where's my treat so the dog might stop right here and say hey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 where's my treat if you just kept cueing them to go around in a circle like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 So another thing you can do is add duration to the behavior with the hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=130.2s	130.2	 signal like this so that when you ask for the behavior with no hand signal on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=135.7s	135.7	 a verbal cue you can then make it easier for the dog. So I'm going to start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=140.6s	140.6	 adding the verbal cue and I'm going to say that direction is called go circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=145.1s	145.1	 so I'm going to say go circle and then I'm going to point and mark and reinforce her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=149.6s	149.6	 So eventually I'm going to hope that she might offer going circle and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 reliably like that and then I can start to say my cue go circle, point and if she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 doesn't go around I can lure her around the cone like that but the goal is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 when I say a verbal cue it's then going to be easier. So you know when to add the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=174.8s	174.8	 verbal cue is when the dog starts to offer the behavior reliably when waiting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=180.4s	180.4	 for the next treat. So there she went around the cone but if I wait she might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 not think to go around it again. Oh there we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 Go circle. Awesome and it wasn't as pretty as when I lured it but it was still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=201.7s	201.7	 something. So if you're really struggling with your dog one thing you can do is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=206.7s	206.7	 lure them behind the cone like this, give them the treat and then they're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=212.1s	212.1	 have to come around the cone in order to find where your treats are kept. So I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=217.9s	217.9	 feeding her back here. Good and marking her choice to continue the circle around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=225.5s	225.5	 Awesome. So now I'm going to say go circle and then point. Awesome. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=232.1s	232.1	 Go circle and if she doesn't think to do it I'm going to lure her. She's doing a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 little spin here so that's not very good so next time I'm going to feed her here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=243.7s	243.7	 so that she's lined up nicely to go all the way around. So where you feed the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 treat is going to also help. So when I was feeding her over here it made her a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=254.4s	254.4	 little confused right here so I'm going to feed her the treat here and make it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 just a little easier and say go circle. Awesome. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=265.2s	265.2	 Go circle. Awesome. Go circle and then I'm going to make it a little bit easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 with the hand signal. Go circle. Go circle. Did you see how she got confused again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=280.6s	280.6	 because she's just following my hand back and forth here but then she finally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=284.5s	284.5	 got it so I'm going to continue to set her up for success by starting the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=289.4s	289.4	 circle where she's most confident to go around the corner. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=295.4s	295.4	 Ready? Go circle. Awesome. Good girl. Ready? Go circle. Yay! And you can see that I'm also using my body as a very minimal cue at the moment so I'm leaning in the direction of going around. Now I'm going to try and stay really still and say go circle. Awesome. I'm still leaning a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 Let's try it one more time. I'm going to stop leaning. Ready? I'm going to set her up by feeding her the treat here. Go circle. And she was already going circle so go circle. Awesome. Good girl. Go circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=342.4s	342.4	 And when she doesn't do it I'm not going to wait. I'm going to quickly lure her then set her up so it's easier in that position here to think to go around because if she's in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=353.4s	353.4	 in the down position she's not going to be down in front of me she's going to think to do a lot of other weird stuff before she thinks to go away from me and around the camp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOMIbtoWkk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=170&pp=iAQB&t=363.4s	363.4	 Well I hope you found this video helpful and insightful for teaching your dog to offer behavior on a verbal cue and get rid of the treat in your hand and if you have any questions leave them as a comment.
