https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXX_sc3Bqx4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=4.2s	4.2	 Now I like to think of the muzzle like a seat belt. You put it on to prevent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXX_sc3Bqx4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=8.4s	8.4	 excessive injury if there were to be an accident. Now nobody puts on their

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXX_sc3Bqx4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 a muzzle, putting it on to your dog and then going into situations where you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXX_sc3Bqx4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=21.3s	21.3	 not sure what might happen or you're not sure if your dog may be able to cope
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXX_sc3Bqx4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=25.7s	25.7	 with the situation. The reason being is because if say you were to put your dog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXX_sc3Bqx4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=44.1s	44.1	 because of what it did to the other dog which made it the other dog go away very

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXX_sc3Bqx4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=80.2s	80.2	 situations where you just don't know what might happen. Hey Splash! So I'm a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXX_sc3Bqx4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 is by teaching the dog a chin rest first. So I'll link a video of how to train
