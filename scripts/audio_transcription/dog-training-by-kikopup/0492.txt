https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This video goes over the two very basic concepts of training a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 The first concept is that you've got to decide what you do want your dog to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=9.1s	9.1	 In other words, make a list of the desirable behaviors you want your dog to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=13.8s	13.8	 Then once you know what you want your dog to do, you can train your dog to do them using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=17.9s	17.9	 positive reinforcement and you can reinforce your dog for doing behaviors you like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=23.2s	23.2	 he already does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=24.8s	24.8	 So for example, if your dog is laying at your feet while you're watching TV and you think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=29.1s	29.1	 that's a wonderful behavior, you can reinforce it by giving your dog attention, playing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 toys or giving him a treat while he's calmly settled at your feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=37.3s	37.3	 So the second basic concept to training a dog is deciding what you don't want your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=41.6s	41.6	 to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 So in other words, deciding what you find undesirable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=47.3s	47.3	 This will be different for different people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 For example, sitting on the couch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 Some people would love their dog to sit on the couch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=53.5s	53.5	 Other people say, nope, that's an undesirable behavior for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 So once you've made that list, you've got to be consistent with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 To train your dog to not do these undesirable behaviors, you train an alternate response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=66.3s	66.3	 So for example, with the couch scenario, if you don't want your dog sitting in the couch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 you can train your dog to love laying in his dog bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 Other things you have to do to stop undesirable behaviors from being reinforced is interrupt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=79.1s	79.1	 them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=80.1s	80.1	 So if you see an undesirable behavior happening, it's most likely going to be self-reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=85.2s	85.2	 So you've got to interrupt that behavior, and the way to do that is using a positive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 interrupter noise, and I'll link a video tutorial up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 So along with interrupting undesirable behaviors, you've also got to use management to prevent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 them from occurring when you don't feel like training or when you're not home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=102.8s	102.8	 An example of this, of management, would be inviting guests over, but because you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=107.3s	107.3	 feel like training your dog, you're just going to have your dog on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=110.5s	110.5	 That way your dog isn't being reinforced for jumping on the guests, and then when the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 is calm enough, he can say hi to the guests and be more likely to succeed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=119.2s	119.2	 One, decide what you do want your dog to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 Make a list of the behaviors that you find desirable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=125.1s	125.1	 Two, train the dog to do the behaviors you like, as well as reinforce your dog for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=130.6s	130.6	 desirable behaviors he does already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 Three, decide what you don't want your dog to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=136.4s	136.4	 Make a list of all the behaviors that you find undesirable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=139.7s	139.7	 Four, train an alternate response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=143.3s	143.3	 For example, train your dog to sit or stand calmly instead of jumping on guests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=148.7s	148.7	 Interrupt your dog when he is doing an undesirable behavior using the positive interrupter, and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=154.4s	154.4	 prevent your dog from doing the behavior when you are not going to be able to train your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31MtfIfDUYc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=493&pp=iAQB&t=159.8s	159.8	 Stay tuned for a tutorial on how to stop attention-seeking behaviors.
