https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=43.7s	43.7	 for the dog rolling onto their side and finally mark your dog and feed for your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=80.4s	80.4	 dog gets reinforced for laying on his side. Step two, add duration and a release
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 cue. Increase the duration that your dog lays on his side before you mark and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 reinforce, but make sure to go back a step and make it easier every once in a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 while so the dog doesn't find it predictably getting harder and harder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=101.9s	101.9	 Add a release cue which means that your dog can get up. If your dog doesn't get

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=114.4s	114.4	 Because I want this to be a calm behavior, I'm using a calm marker. One
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 that I use for settles, handling, grooming and other calm behaviors and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 not a marker used for exciting behaviors like freestyle and agility. Step three,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=136.3s	136.3	 play dead and is very comfortable with handling, you can add the two together.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=147.4s	147.4	 If your dog lifts his head up, simply move your hand away. Another technique is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 to touch your dog and mark when your dog puts his head down again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 Never force your dog to stay. If your dog wants to get up or move away from you, let him.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 which is life-threatening. This step could be very frightening to dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 so if your dog is not liking it, stop and go back a step. What I am doing is luring the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=220.1s	220.1	 to roll on his back while supporting his weight from the underside. You can break this up into

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 bit and then finally having your leg touch him. Here's an example of a first training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=240.1s	240.1	 I'm marking for Lou, lifting her paw up on her own and then also marking for me touching Lou

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=262.3s	262.3	 reinforce your dog for putting his head down. You can also use your cue for play dead.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QqrmDJmNJk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=368&pp=iAQB&t=305.4s	305.4	 Yep, good girl.
