https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This is my first video blog and it's a rant on the what people consider clicker training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=6.2s	6.2	 It's very frustrating for me that my clients as well as you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 just the general public are getting the wrong idea about what clicker training what the clicker training method is and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=17.3s	17.3	 What I want to say a show today is is that it's this really magical way of training animals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 That doesn't involve any forms of intimidation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=27.6s	27.6	 Punishment corrections or anything bad icky that the animal dislikes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 So that doesn't mean just in training sessions that means during the whole time that you interact with your animal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=39.4s	39.4	 You are in fact training them in the clicker using the clicker training method
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=43.9s	43.9	 Clicker training is a method that you can use to train animals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=47.9s	47.9	 And it's a method that you can use to train animals to train animals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=51.9s	51.9	 Basically clicker training in my opinion is what Karen Pryor the the the person who created the term
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Her definition of it is is a subset of apparent conditioning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=64.1s	64.1	 Which is basically you add good things to the dog's environment and take away good things from the dog's environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=71.6s	71.6	 So it's just that that's all there is to clicker training and it makes it so simple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 But people get emotions involved in it dog is stubborn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=81.4s	81.4	 You know they put human human emotions on on these creatures and and so add in punishment into the clicker training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=90.6s	90.6	 Punishment meaning positive punishment where you tell the dog you know click you if you do it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=96.7s	96.7	 But I'm gonna go if you do it wrong that in my definition is not clicker training that is apparent conditioning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=103.3s	103.3	 Using a clicker so basically old-school dog training with a gadget in hand, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=108.9s	108.9	 I've got a fun little list of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=111.7s	111.7	 How do you know if you're clicker training or not so oh quickly first?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=116.4s	116.4	 You can still be using the clicker training method if you're not using food and a clicker surprise surprise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 You know SeaWorld uses a whistle my friend uses the word yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=125.3s	125.3	 She says yes and gives a treat yes and give something great yes and opens the door you you mark behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 And you reinforce it that's what clicker training is you don't have to have a little gadget
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=136.5s	136.5	 You don't have to have a little bag of treats attached to your body at all times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=141.1s	141.1	 That is not what clicker training is about it's about a way of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=148.2s	148.2	 reprimand free training where you build the greatest trust and the greatest relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 Possible with your animal that's based on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=157.5s	157.5	 Scientific training rather than your emotions here's my list of you're not using clicker training if so number one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 If you're using reprimands intimidation punishment during training sessions, you're not using clicker training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=174.9s	174.9	 If you're using reprimands intimidation and punishment outside of training just in regular life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=180.8s	180.8	 You're not you're not using clicker training clickers training is basically a method that you're using a hundred percent of the time that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 Spend with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 I'm not making this video to piss anybody off about how they training their dog at this point in time

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 what it's all about is about this technique of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=204.1s	204.1	 building trust and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 Security safety and and getting amazing behaviors from animals, you know when I found out about clicker training

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=217.2s	217.2	 And it you know, I still feel bad and I just thought you know, if only I'd known
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=222.1s	222.1	 I wouldn't have gone to the choke chain class when I was 10 years old and made her into this

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwO9nJGnstg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=597&pp=iAQB&t=303.8s	303.8	 Command your dog to do this or tell your dog to do this rather than ask your dog to do that or cue your dog
