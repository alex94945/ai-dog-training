https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Step 1. Get a toy sword, PVC pipe or foam stick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 We bought one for a couple of dollars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 Step 2. Toss a treat over the sword and click as the dog jumps over it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 It can help to have a mat to toss the treat to as well as a barrier so the dog doesn't just go around the sword.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 Step 3. Pretend to toss a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 This time pretend to toss a treat and as the dog jumps over the sword click and produce the treat where the dog had expected it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 Step 4. Let the dog think it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 After repeating the previous steps your dog should predict that a reward will happen if he jumps over the sword.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 So click any movement of jumping over the sword.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 Perhaps your dog doesn't jump all the way over but takes a step over. Click anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 Step 5. Increase criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 Once your dog is getting it you can ask for more jumps before each treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 As well as removing the barrier so the dog is learning to jump over the sword even though there isn't anything blocking him on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Here you can see I'm removing the barrier completely and adding more motion to my sword swipes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 You want to be very careful and respectful of your dog and make sure you go at the pace they need.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 Here is the final result of the sword fighting trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 You can be as creative as you want to be when playing with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 Spash and I are working on a canine freestyle routine that is based on the theme of pirates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 And a sword fight is going to be part of the routine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIonFqN0hoc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=492&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 Thanks for watching and stay tuned for more free professional dog training videos.
