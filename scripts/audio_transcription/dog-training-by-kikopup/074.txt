https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, this video is a brief introduction to my protocol for working with dogs with issues with predation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Back in 2013, I made a video on this protocol through Tozer Dog Video entitled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 Harnessing the Hunter, Building Your Relationship and Reliability with Your Hunting Dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 And you can find a link to where you can buy that video on demand on my website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 On that same year, I made a protocol for reactive dogs as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 If you've come across my videos through YouTube, you might think that I'm just a dog trainer who makes videos in their own house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 but I actually have an extensive professional career in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 Over the last decade, I've traveled to six continents, giving seminars and being invited to multiple conferences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 I've actually presented this material at the Art and Science of Animal Training in Texas,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 and I've also presented how I break up steps when using this protocol for behavior and emotional modification at the Clicker Expo Europe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 There are many different ways of training dogs, but in the way that I train using errorless learning and positive reinforcement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 differential reinforcement of an incompatible behavior, I don't want to see the dog rehearsing the undesirable behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 because the focus is on creating those neural pathways and stronger pathways to the behavior you do want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 So you're building this new pathway in the woods. There's two pathways and you're building a new one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 You don't want the dog, you know, making the other pathway stronger by rehearsing the behavior just so you can see what it looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 So in this footage that I'm going to show you, I am actually showing the dogs behaving undesirably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 My terrier and also my ex-wife's dog Trish, who was a hunting pidenko who had a history of hunting and being overexcited by prey before she rescued the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 And my terrier, who didn't have a history of hunting and then we moved to Sweden and he saw these new animals and his brain switched on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 I wouldn't set a dog up to rehearse undesirable behavior that you're trying to get rid of on purpose just to see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 But in these circumstances, I happened to catch it on film when, say, for example, we were in a big field and there was no escape from seeing whatever it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 Part of the protocol for working on these issues with your dog is using management and prevention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 So we had to prevent these situations from happening during the training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 For Tug, this little terrier here, he got very excited the first time he moved to Sweden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 And his training actually only took a month before we didn't have to use any more management and prevention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 And Trish, the pidenko who had a history of hunting before adoption, she took six months before we could have her dragging the long line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 After some training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 Good girl, Trish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 Look, Trish, what a bit. Look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 Good girl. Where are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Baby. Trish. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 Hi, Trish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 I know, it's pretty exciting. They all ran, didn't they?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 Leave it. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=246.0s	246.0	 Good girl, Trish. Leave it. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=251.0s	251.0	 Come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 Come on, Tuggy. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 Tug, here!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 Okay, Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 Tug free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 Tug free. Come on, go play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 Tug, go play. Free. Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=297.0s	297.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 Hi, Tug. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 Good job, Trish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 Here's some footage of my terrier just sniffing around in the morning on my property.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 And there's a rabbit that runs out in front of him, and he just looks curiously at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=349.0s	349.0	 And there's one on the hosepipe that runs away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 and he doesn't even notice it because there's always a lot of rabbits in my backyard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=358.0s	358.0	 I had to work with my dogs around chickens, and I also worked with them around rabbits, pet rabbits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 There were always rabbits and squirrels on my property,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=367.0s	367.0	 but they never dared go into my backyard that's fenced, where my dogs like to hang out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 And so the first time that the squirrels came in, which is in this footage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=378.0s	378.0	 my dogs were mildly interested because there was someone new in their property.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 But as you can see, no one really did anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 The rabbits and the squirrels soon figured out that my dogs don't chase them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 so they would come and live in my backyard, obviously for safety reasons and because of the food source.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=403.0s	403.0	 So I actually had to start chasing them away myself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=406.0s	406.0	 and it started to get ridiculous how many squirrels and rabbits were sharing the yard with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=417.0s	417.0	 There's a stupid squirrel under here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=423.0s	423.0	 Sadly, Trish passed in 2020, but she had a wonderful life with Martina in Sweden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=429.0s	429.0	 running free in the forests and getting to do fun activities like sledding and canine freestyle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=436.0s	436.0	 which would have been impossible because Martina needed to practice in her yard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=441.0s	441.0	 which didn't have a fence and that wildlife would move through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 So before any of the training that she did with the freestyle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=448.0s	448.0	 she really built Trish's interest in wanting to be with her and work with her and choose her over hunting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=456.0s	456.0	 So I made the video when I was living in Sweden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=459.0s	459.0	 and it was just a really, really wonderful experience working with my ex-wife's dogs, Trish and also Lacey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=468.0s	468.0	 She rescued a lurcher, so I had these two hunting dogs that I lived with, and they trained me so well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=474.0s	474.0	 I learned so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=476.0s	476.0	 Now I'm having an issue, a predation issue with my little terrier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=482.0s	482.0	 and it's so interesting to see the difference because with my little terrier, he's on and then he's off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=488.0s	488.0	 So he hunts, he's killed, and then right after, it's like he's not excited anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=495.0s	495.0	 But with the pedenko, Trish, sadly, what was happening was a downward spiral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=503.0s	503.0	 Even if she got, even if she was off leash and chased something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=507.0s	507.0	 it actually was worse because of the stress, the good stress of chasing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=512.0s	512.0	 The animal made her so excited, she became physically sick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=516.0s	516.0	 If she chased an animal in the forest and then we were inside the house,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=521.0s	521.0	 she would just go red and her skin just broke out in sores from allergies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=527.0s	527.0	 and it reinstated her separation anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=533.0s	533.0	 So she would hunt, come home, and then immediately if we were going to try and leave,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=539.0s	539.0	 she was extremely anxious like she'd had no training for her separation anxiety training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=544.0s	544.0	 And then the more, it was like a downward spiral because then the separation anxiety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=549.0s	549.0	 would then trigger her to want to hunt more and get stressed by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=553.0s	553.0	 So she just got worse and worse, and that's when I started making this video on demand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=560.0s	560.0	 harnessing the hunter, trying to help her because she got so sick that she actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=565.0s	565.0	 started being allergic to all different foods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=567.0s	567.0	 So we actually had her on a kibble made of feathers, mainly feathers or vegan stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=575.0s	575.0	 We tried two different kibbles and that's how we trained her to stop hunting using vegan kibbles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=582.0s	582.0	 So it is possible and the key that makes it possible is making the steps small enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=589.0s	589.0	 So the dog is succeeding every step of the way and the conditioning is pure and you're making sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=596.0s	596.0	 that you're not jumping ahead and watering down your conditioning to where your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=602.0s	602.0	 practicing the behavior or feeling stressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=604.0s	604.0	 So after working on reducing her excitement around prey and building her motivation to want to listen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=614.0s	614.0	 it really drastically decreased her allergies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=621.0s	621.0	 She was able to eat different types of food and she was also able to have a wonderful life being off leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=628.0s	628.0	 or on a long line and it also helped with her separation anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=633.0s	633.0	 So I really, really think that this is a great method for working with dogs with hunting issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=641.0s	641.0	 because you're not punishing them for doing what they were instinctually bred for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=646.0s	646.0	 Instead, you're teaching them how to deal with those emotions and be okay when they can't get to the thing that they want to get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=654.0s	654.0	 In Harnessing the Hunter, I go over important exercises and behaviors to train your hunting dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=660.0s	660.0	 to build your dog's reliability for listening to you as well as build your relationship with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=667.0s	667.0	 One of the exercises that I go over is teaching your dog an attention noise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=672.0s	672.0	 which I've coined the term positive interrupter for because you can use it to interrupt your dog's undesirable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=680.0s	680.0	 So I go over how to work on that behavior, but I do have a lot of videos on YouTube that you can find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=687.0s	687.0	 if you search for attention noise, attention game, and positive interrupter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=692.0s	692.0	 I also go over the protocol for raising criteria when working with a dog around a trigger such as prey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=698.0s	698.0	 and I'll show you a little clip of that now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=723.0s	723.0	 Hi. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=734.0s	734.0	 Hi. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=742.0s	742.0	 The video also covers games to play with your hunting dog and a default leave it from prey,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=747.0s	747.0	 and I'll show you an example of that right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=753.0s	753.0	 Look, dears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=760.0s	760.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=768.0s	768.0	 Look, dears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=772.0s	772.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=774.0s	774.0	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=780.0s	780.0	 Leave it from prey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=786.0s	786.0	 Good girl. Leave it. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=794.0s	794.0	 Leave it. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=797.0s	797.0	 Look. Look. A rabbit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=803.0s	803.0	 You see it? Leave it. Trish. Yes. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=812.0s	812.0	 Trish, leave it. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=822.0s	822.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=827.0s	827.0	 Leave it. Yes. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=832.0s	832.0	 Here's an example of a default leave it from prey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=835.0s	835.0	 This means that the situation of the rabbit being in the road up ahead of us and running off of the road
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=843.0s	843.0	 cues Trish to look at it and then to leave it and go the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=849.0s	849.0	 So here you can see she's seeing the rabbit and then turning and walking the other way without any verbal cue or visual cue from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1huPBezk_pA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=859.0s	859.0	 Thank you so much for watching. Don't forget to check out the description for the links to the videos and the protocol. See you later.
