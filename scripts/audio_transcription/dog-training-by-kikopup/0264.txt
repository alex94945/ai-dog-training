https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=3.5s	3.5	 physical or psychological intimidation when training dogs and that is because I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=7.6s	7.6	 want to condition my cue or what other people call command into something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 that's called a secondary reinforcer. What does that mean? It means that when I say
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=16.2s	16.2	 a cue like sit, it not only makes the dog feel good when I say it and makes them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=25.8s	25.8	 example if you ask for three minutes of tricks or maybe obedience that every

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=41.3s	41.3	 conditioning cues as secondary reinforcers is that sometimes they can

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 cues like sit, down and things like that every time you say your cue it's almost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=55.2s	55.2	 like you've punished the behavior your dog has just done and it can make the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 my cues become secondary reinforcers and if they're not I have to figure out why

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=80.6s	80.6	 something like that but what happens is is it can water down the reinforcement

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=265&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 that the cue always predicts reinforcement or for example if the dog
