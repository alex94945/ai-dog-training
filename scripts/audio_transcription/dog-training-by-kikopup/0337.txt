https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 In this tutorial I'm going to teach you what I believe to be the fastest, most reliable, and easy way to teach the behavior drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 I learned this technique it was about 13 years ago from my friend and dog trainer, Kate Pelesse,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 and since then I have not found a more reliable way to teach the fastest drop and most reliable drop possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 Now the reason I love this technique is one, you're using errorless learning so the dog isn't practicing a slow drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 where you say drop and then you wait and wait and wait and then the dog thinks oh yeah I should drop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 Because what can happen is if your dog rehearses a behavior it could possibly show up in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 So in training if you're making a lot of mistakes those could pop up again in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 Where if you're training with errorless learning so your dog is always practicing the right behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 your dog will be less likely to do the wrong thing like not dropping the thing at all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 or holding on a few seconds or mouthing whatever it is before dropping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 The second reason that I really love this technique is that you're building the dog's choice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 The dog is offering the behavior and you're pairing a cue to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 So you're not intimidating and forcing the dog where the dog is thinking hmm I rather have the thing but I better drop it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 because she said no I can't have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 You're making it so that the dog is actually having an emotion of yes I want to drop this because it's in my best interest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 And you build that cue every time you say it it's in your dog's best interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 and after some repetition your dog is always going to believe it's in his best interest to drop what he has.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 While the dog is tugging on a toy put a treat directly to your dog's nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 Click or say yes as the dog drops the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 Now in this tutorial we'll use toys to get the behavior but if you have a dog that gets extremely extremely excited by toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 and not so much excited by food or if you have a dog that won't even have a toy in his mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 because he just doesn't like tugging or playing with toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 you can do the same tutorial on how to teach drop using a dog's chew bone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 I'll link the tutorial up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 Now if you have a dog that is not very excited by toys I suggest the first step is getting your dog to offer tugging on the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 So tease the dog with the toy. Your dog might not want to play with the toy if you're holding food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 so just don't give him any food and just continue to try and get your dog to play with the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 Then when he's tugging on it for at least three seconds then start to see if you might get your dog to drop the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 Now if you have the opposite problem your dog gets way too excited by toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 Don't even start with your dog's favorite toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 Use something that your dog's not really that interested in or something he's never seen before like a cloth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 and you're not going to go ready steady get it because then the dog might not want to drop the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 if he hasn't learned the cue drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 You can do something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 Okay take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 And you can see that she wanted to drop the toy for the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 You can use a clicker to train this behavior but you have to muffle the clicker or use a very soft sounding clicker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 because what can happen is as your hands are near your dog's face and you click it's going to be extremely loud
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 and it can startle your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 So you're going to get your dog interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 And as they're tugging you put food to their nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 and click the moment you see the dog's mouth opening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 Step 2. Add verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 When your dog is dropping the tug the millisecond that you put the treat to your dog's nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 that's when you're going to add your verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 So you're going to say your verbal cue, drop, and then move to put the treat on your dog's nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=242.0s	242.0	 Now if you say drop as you move your dog or your puppy isn't going to learn the verbal cue as quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 as if you first say the verbal cue and then move your hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 because what you're teaching your dog is that word predicts that your hand is going to come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 and you're going to create that emotional response of yes I want to drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 because it reminds the dog of that hand gesture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 Ready, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 So Wish already knows the cue D-R-O-P
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 So I'm going to say another cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 So I'm going to say out and then I'm going to move to put the treat near her nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 and click the moment she drops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 Out. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 You always want to invite your dog to get the toy after they've dropped it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 Out. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 You can also click or say yes and reinforce your dog for staying back away from the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 until you've given the dog permission to get it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=302.0s	302.0	 Yes. Yay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 Look, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 So then, he's tugging, you can add your cue drop and then hold the treat to his nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 and then he does and you can say yes and then give him the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=317.0s	317.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=318.0s	318.0	 Step 3. After a couple of training sessions, see if the dog can offer the behavior with only the verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 Then you can say the cue and see if your dog might think to drop the toy before you move your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 Out. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=333.0s	333.0	 Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 Drop. Yes. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 Ready, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=341.0s	341.0	 Drop. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=344.0s	344.0	 If the dog doesn't drop the tug within two seconds of you saying the verbal cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 I suggest quickly putting the treat to your dog's nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 So at first, when you're training the verbal cue, you can give them a couple seconds to think about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 and click their decision to drop the cue or the tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=360.0s	360.0	 But later when they know the cue, if they don't immediately drop the tug,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 I suggest quickly putting the treat to the nose and getting a quick drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=369.0s	369.0	 so that you're not building a slow drop in your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 Are you ready? Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 So say I said the cue out, she didn't drop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 I'm going to move and present the treat and then make it easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 so that next time she might think to drop it faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 Okay. Out. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=391.0s	391.0	 And her cue isn't out, it is drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 So she just learned the new cue very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 If you have a dog that gets extremely excited by tugging,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=400.0s	400.0	 you can teach them to hold an object first. Ready? Take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=404.0s	404.0	 And then it's not as fun as when you're pulling back on the object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 Then you can teach the drop cue after that and then move on to tugging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtRfGA4zzjA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=338&pp=iAQB&t=414.0s	414.0	 Good job, Wishing.
