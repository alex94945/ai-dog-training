https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Step 1. Toss a treat in the bed. So the first step is throwing a treat into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 bed and clicking your puppy for going to eat the treat. As you click you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=13.4s	13.4	 want to then feed the treats in the bed so the bed is this huge reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=17.6s	17.6	 zone. Good job! And you can give a release cue like free and click your puppy for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 coming away from the bed. Ready? Good boy! Awesome! Good job! Step 2. Pretend to throw a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=38.7s	38.7	 So after repeating this step of throwing a treat in and clicking your puppy for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 going to eat it, you can then go on to the next step which is pretending to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 throw a treat in. And once you pretend to throw a treat in, you click your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 for going towards the bed or into the bed and then they still get the treat. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 you click steps towards it or a step into the bed and then throw the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=66.3s	66.3	 Good job! So here you can see he's not putting his feet in the bed so I might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=76.6s	76.6	 just wait and see if he might go to sniff inside the bed and by mistake put
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=80.9s	80.9	 his foot in the bed. Then I can feed multiple treats for being on the bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 It's easier if you have a bigger bed. If you have a very small bed that they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=90.5s	90.5	 to curl up in, they might be less successful with this exercise. So the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=94.5s	94.5	 bigger the target zone, the easier the exercise is. Great! Okay, so if your fake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=102.1s	102.1	 treat isn't working anymore, simply go back to the step of throwing the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=106.2s	106.2	 into the bed. Good boy! Step three, wait and see if the dog thinks to go to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=120.6s	120.6	 bed. So after playing this game a couple of times, you can see if your dog might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 think to go in the bed on their own. So just a step towards the bed equals a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=132.4s	132.4	 click of a treat. Ready? Good boy! I'm gonna feed him the treat in the bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 Step four, add a cue. Now I'm pretty sure this time that he's gonna go right into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=167.3s	167.3	 the bed so that's when you add your cue, when you know your puppy is gonna head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 on over there and go in their bed. So who must free? I wasn't quite sure who might do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=178.8s	178.8	 so I didn't say the cue. This time, free! I'm gonna say go in your bed. Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 Awesome! So some puppies, some dogs might not think to lay down when they go in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=193.2s	193.2	 their bed. So you can actually, once they've gone in there, lure them into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=197.9s	197.9	 down position with the treat and give them the treat as an added step. Free! So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=203.3s	203.3	 they've gone in their bed and then you lure them into the down position, move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=206.8s	206.8	 your hand away, click and give them the treat. And then keep reinforcing them for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=211.7s	211.7	 staying in the down position. Step five, proof the behavior. Now you can practice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 proofing it from different parts of the room. Ready? Go in your bed. Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=229.8s	229.8	 Free! Go in your bed. Awesome job! And you don't always want to give them a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 as soon as they get in the bed once they've learned it because then if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=240.4s	240.4	 don't then they get frustrated and say, hey, where's my treat? So to proof the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 stay in the bed while other things are happening you need to do a whole bunch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=248.1s	248.1	 of different distractions and if your puppy gets out of the bed, if they don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=252.2s	252.2	 quickly run back in, you can simply quickly lure them back to the bed into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=256.8s	256.8	 the down position and then make the distraction easier. So Kiko, bite your tail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=261.5s	261.5	 Yes. So go in your bed. I'm simply gonna take a step away from him. Yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=271.2s	271.2	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=287.7s	287.7	 your puppy gets up out of the bed you want to say yes and feed them a treat. If
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=291.7s	291.7	 your puppy doesn't get up, encourage them to get up. So you say the release cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 free, and if your puppy doesn't get up you encourage them. Yes. Good boy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=308.7s	308.7	 teaching the puppy to settle in the bed and I have a tutorial on how to teach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 the settle but basically you have the bed next to you and you work on a settle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMNup72dGyA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=350&pp=iAQB&t=317.4s	317.4	 and you can see the link to the video if you look down in the description. So
