https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=4.7s	4.7	 One, if you have more than one dog on a walk, sometimes it can be hard to turn around and go the other way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=9.6s	9.6	 if both dogs are ahead of you. Teaching them to back into the heel position allows you to move freely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=14.6s	14.6	 Two, if you train your dog that when he reaches the end of the leash, the only way he can move forwards again is to back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=21.1s	21.1	 He will consciously start to avoid hitting the end of the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=24.3s	24.3	 This means no pulling on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=26.5s	26.5	 Three, it is a great impulse control exercise based on the Premack Principle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=30.7s	30.7	 In order to move forwards, you must first move backwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 To teach back up, take a treat, put it under your dog's chin, and take a step backwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=39.6s	39.6	 Click as they step back to get the treat, and give the dog the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=43.4s	43.4	 You can use a wall to sandwich your dog between if their butt starts to spin out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 You can also teach back up with the dog in front of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=51.6s	51.6	 Walk into the dog with the treat under their chin and click as they back up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 If you have the treat above their head at first, the dog will tend to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=59.4s	59.4	 Once the dog is consistent with the treat, try without a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=62.6s	62.6	 Now the next step is to turn and be next to your dog as they back up in the same location they were in before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=68.6s	68.6	 Here I'm showing you the three steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 Feeding the dog from below, feeding the dog from above, and then having no treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 And clicking the dog for backing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=80.4s	80.4	 The next step is adding a cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=82.4s	82.4	 So you'll say the cue first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 and click the dog for backing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=88.4s	88.4	 If the dog doesn't back up when you say back up, simply do the hand cue again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 Once your dog has learned to back up reliably on cue, you can start to use the reward of walking forwards again as the reward rather than a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=101.4s	101.4	 Here's the end result.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl9JxFh0s4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=542&pp=iAQB&t=120.4s	120.4	 Okay, I'm just going to...
