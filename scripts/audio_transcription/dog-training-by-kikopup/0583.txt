https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 Here you can see I am walking down the street with my two dogs and both of the leashes are slack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 There is no tension in the leash and both dogs are calm and relaxed and doing what they like to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 Look around and sniff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 When you follow a dog on a tight leash you are actually training the dog to pull.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 This is because they are getting a big reward for tugging you along behind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 They get to move forwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 Not only is pulling uncomfortable for the owner, but is uncomfortable for the dog as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 A dog that pulls on leash is more likely to become over aroused on walks because of the tension on their neck or chest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 causing them to bark and lunge at other dogs and people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 By walking on a loose leash, a dog learns to control their impulses and behave in a relaxed and calm manner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 This is Max at Chihuahua. He is giving a demo on what pulling on leash looks like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 He is not looking back once and pulling ahead, getting to where he wants to go, without a care in the world what I am doing behind him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 I mean nothing to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 Here is one game you can play. Drop a treat and walk ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 As the dog catches up, click them before they get to you and reinforce them in the position you would like them to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 So drop the treat at the back of your heel or feed them back behind your leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 What to do if the dog pulls?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 If the dog pulls ahead and the leash becomes tense, simply stop, encourage the dog back by patting your leg or making a kissy noise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 take a couple steps back and when they are in a nice loose leash, continue walking forwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 If the leash becomes tense again, just simply continue doing the backing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 Another technique is, as the leash becomes tense, you simply turn around and go the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 Don't forget to click your dog when you see them walking perfectly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Also practice stopping and clicking them for staying with you. If they rush ahead, no click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 Here is a training tip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 Practice indoors first where there is no distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 You want to build a strong foundation on the behavior of being next to you is the best place to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 If you do your homework and practice in your yard and in your house first before you hit the street,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 your dog will be more likely to be attentive to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 Another technique is, don't go for the walk in the park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 Another technique is, don't go for the walk that you usually do where your dog habitually pulls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 Instead, practice walking back and forth, back and forth in front of your house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 Not only do you become very unpredictable in the direction that you are going,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 which can make your dog much more attentive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 but your dog no longer knows which way is forwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=185.0s	185.0	 Therefore, they are less likely to want to pull ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 The great thing about this technique is you are not forcing your dogs to stay with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 You are building being next to you as a wonderful place to be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 so that even when you drop the leash, your dogs want to stay with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvYwDvJnzc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=584&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 and in those positions that you have reinforced them for staying.
