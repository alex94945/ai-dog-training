https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POM8wwnRSk4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 If the dog tries to go behind you to get the treat, simply lure the dog through the hoop

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POM8wwnRSk4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 You want to say yes or click at the precise moment the dog jumps through your legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POM8wwnRSk4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=41.6s	41.6	 If you're struggling to balance, hold on to something stable so that you don't fall over.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POM8wwnRSk4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=60.5s	60.5	 Be patient if your dog tries other ways to get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POM8wwnRSk4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=63.7s	63.7	 Simply only say yes when the dog does the behavior that you like.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POM8wwnRSk4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 Save the cue before you do your hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POM8wwnRSk4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=481&pp=iAQB&t=91.6s	91.6	 I wouldn't recommend teaching a larger dog to jump through your legs as they can knock
