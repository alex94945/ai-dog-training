https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 You can sit on a couch and put one foot out ahead of you and the other one next to the couch like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 So the dog is highly likely to go under your leg and it's as though you took a step forward and then simply switch feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 So it's like you're taking steps like that. Good legs. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 And you can lure your dog underneath. And as your dog starts to follow the hand signal like that. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 I'm doing two at a time here and they've never worked together doing this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 But I wanted to go back and show you what it's like. So they look a little bit untrained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 But basically once they start to do it you can add a verbal cue and my cue is legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 So I say go legs and then lure them underneath my legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 And then eventually it's just the foot coming out that gets the dog to go under. Tug go legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-2IyVFDmQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=24&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 And then you can start to stand up. Go legs. Good. Go legs. Good. Go legs. Tug go legs. Good.
