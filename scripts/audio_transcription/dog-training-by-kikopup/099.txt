https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone and welcome to Kikopup's dog training tip of the day for today. Today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=5.4s	5.4	 I'm going to be talking about creating a behavior sequence that your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=9.2s	9.2	 memorizes not only to show off your dog's cool behaviors or tricks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 but also so that you can teach your dog to work on a variable ratio of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=18.6s	18.6	 reinforcement without frustration. So today I'm going to be working with Bliss here, my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 nine month old Border Collie and teaching him a cute sequence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=27.7s	27.7	 So the important thing is choosing behaviors that are strong and that the dog can do reliably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=34.1s	34.1	 If you have a new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=36.2s	36.2	 young dog that doesn't have any reliable behaviors, you can choose that aren't that strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=41.9s	41.9	 You can choose behaviors that are the best that you worked on the most and then you can revert to using the lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=48.1s	48.1	 while going through the behaviors and also using a high rate of reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=52.1s	52.1	 So you might give a treat for every single behavior that you ask for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=56.8s	56.8	 So to begin with I'm going to warm Bliss up with playing with the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=62.8s	62.8	 Ready? Get it. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Drop. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 Ready? Go around. Get it. Yeah, good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=74.3s	74.3	 Awesome. Drop. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=77.1s	77.1	 Okay, he's warmed up. So now I'm gonna go over the behaviors that are gonna be in the sequence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=82.1s	82.1	 One is going to be sitting. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=85.4s	85.4	 Good. Get it. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 So I'm just testing to see if the behaviors are nice and reliable before I try to make them into a chain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=94.8s	94.8	 So now he's sitting. He's looking at a bird that's landed right off camera. Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=100.7s	100.7	 The next one is paws up on my leg. Both paws. Good. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=105.9s	105.9	 And as you noticed I have a marker that means you're doing it right, which is good like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 And then I say get it because what I don't want, especially if you have your dog on your back or on your body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=119.6s	119.6	 that when you say get it they're gonna like take off of your body and scratch you up or it can create unreliable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 behaviors that are a little messy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 So I like to with stationary behaviors mark the behavior and then with a marker that means stay there and then say get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 So it's not that he's got his paws on my leg and then I say get it and he then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=143.1s	143.1	 pushes off of me to get the toy. Why are you sitting like that? Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 So we have the sit, we have the paws on my leg, and then we have a twirl behavior and a spin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=156.2s	156.2	 And I could do these without luring, but you might want to start with luring just so that it's fun and exciting for your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 if they've never done a behavior sequence before. Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=168.3s	168.3	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=170.2s	170.2	 The other thing that we're gonna do is have him go through my legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 Good. Okay, so now we're gonna put the behaviors together. So I'm gonna ask him to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Good. And then both paws. Get it. Good job. And then after he does both paws, I'm gonna ask him to twirl. Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=190.7s	190.7	 Twirl. Good. Get it. And why am I letting go of the toy drop? To ask him to drop is because he doesn't have a reliable drop when I'm tugging and I feel like using a toy to train this behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=202.4s	202.4	 Are you ready? Go legs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=204.5s	204.5	 Get it. Good. So after he twirls, he goes through my legs. Then I ask him to sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=210.2s	210.2	 Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=212.4s	212.4	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=214.5s	214.5	 Both paws. And then spin. Get it. Woohoo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=220.8s	220.8	 Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=222.3s	222.3	 And then go through my legs again. Woohoo. Good job. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=228.4s	228.4	 Drop. Awesome. Now if I wanted to teach him to drop while tugging, that would be its own tutorial. I mean, its own training session of itself. I'm not gonna work on that and work on the sequence at the same time. That's too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=242.5s	242.5	 too much to do in one training session. So I'm making it easy and just asking him to drop when I when I'm not holding it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 So we begin in the sitting position and he's starting to we actually worked on this a little bit already, but he's starting to anticipate what I want next. So I'm gonna wait till he's sitting again and then wait till he does it on cue. So I'm gonna say both paws. Good. Twirl. Go legs. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=270.7s	270.7	 Both paws. Spin. Woo. And that was hard for him. Spin. Go legs. Get it. So now I know that it's hard for him to spin on this side or maybe I just asked for too much. So what I'm gonna do is start him here while he's got his paws up on my leg. Drop and then ask him to spin. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 Sit. Paws up. Ready? And I'm gonna use a nice luring gesture. Ready? Paws up. Spin. Good. Get it. Nice. Woo hoo hoo. Drop. Good. Spin. Get it. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=314.6s	314.6	 So they're doing these sequences also brings to light parts of your training that need work and it's not that he's saying no or that he's stupid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=326.6s	326.6	 But not to call a dog stupid. There's no stupid dogs or stupid people. Drop. It's just a lack of information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=334.1s	334.1	 So if I say spin and he doesn't spin, it's just that this cue isn't working. So I can say spin and then use the lure to get him to spin. Ready? Spin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=348.1s	348.1	 Good. Get it. Woo hoo hoo. Now Halo is going to show off a little bit. Sit. Ready? Both paws twirl. Go legs. Sit. Both paws spin. Go legs. Sit. Both paws twirl. Go legs. Sit. Both paws spin. Go legs. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=365.1s	365.1	 And now the other sequence he has is twirl. Twirl. Turn back through. Spin. Spin. Flip back through. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=373.1s	373.1	 So if you were going to make a behavior chain with two sequences together, you can always practice them in different orders, but get them used to the transitions between, hello, between sequences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=385.1s	385.1	 So that they don't realize that the sequences are going to go on and on forever and that they're these fun short things and they never know what might happen next rather than, oh no, Emily's going to do four minutes of tricks with me and I'm not going to get a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=400.1s	400.1	 So that's what keeps it fun and gets them wanting to do more behaviors for less primary or secondary reinforcers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=410.1s	410.1	 So that they can, you know, the behaviors themselves become fun for the dogs to do. So they even get up from their stay to want to do more. And I'm going to reinforce him. Ready? Get that. There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=423.1s	423.1	 Wish free. Can you nod? Nod. Nod. Stand up. Walk on. Walk on. Walk on. Walk on. Wait. Sit pretty. Stand up. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=437.1s	437.1	 Good girl. Bring. Good girl. Ready? Wish. Up. Woohoo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxpflctSrM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=100&pp=iAQB&t=447.1s	447.1	 Thank you so much for watching.
