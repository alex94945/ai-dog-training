https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone in this video I'm going to go over two common myths in dog training on the topics of teaching a puppy not to bite as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=8.1s	8.1	 well as teaching a puppy to be safe and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=11.3s	11.3	 calm and confident when being restrained such as for a veterinary visit or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 When an owner needs to hold hold their dog or pick the dog up. So the first one teaching a puppy not to bite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 I have to first say that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 There are many different ways of training dogs and in this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=30.8s	30.8	 I'm just talking about the fact that there are different ways that work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=35.2s	35.2	 So when I first got into dog training, I learned in Dunbar's method and I love Ian Dunbar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=41.7s	41.7	 I think he did amazing, you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 He's changed the world of dog training for the better and his technique of teaching a puppy not to bite works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=50.5s	50.5	 Because I've used it and it works really well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=53.1s	53.1	 However, I do use a different method because for some clients
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 I feel like they they don't succeed as well my own clients with with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=64.5s	64.5	 With the process of teaching about a puppy to bite you and then bite you softer and softer until they bite you no more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=71.1s	71.1	 That's very very basically said so you're teaching the puppy bite inhibition, but also teaching the puppy not to bite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 So that technique works I'm not saying that it doesn't and I'm not saying that it's a lesser technique
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 I love Ian Dunbar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=85.7s	85.7	 What I am saying is there is another method that is that is functional and I'm going to talk about it very briefly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 But so this isn't this video is not being negative about other techniques
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 It's about saying there are there are options and I'm going to talk about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 Why I train?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 No biting using this other method
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 Firstly, I would say there's some breeds like a huskies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 And maybe German Shepherds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 I don't want to be labeling breeds, but there's some breeds or puppies with a specific personality where they're very mouthy and so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=126.5s	126.5	 What can happen if you let the puppy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 Practice or rehearse a behavior even if they don't get any reinforcements
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=134.9s	134.9	 History from it. There's still a memory that's created between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 seeing a hand and biting it so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 There's a there's a there's a rehearsal history where the puppy has rehearsed the behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=147.7s	147.7	 So for me, I like to make it so that there's you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=152.1s	152.1	 Errorless learning where there's no rehearsal history of the puppy mouthing your hands and feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 So you're going to do that by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Using management and prevention if you know when your puppy is going to bite you you prevent those situations from occurring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 While you train the puppy that the stimulus of your hands moving or touching them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=171.6s	171.6	 means some other behavior besides biting so you can do that in small approximations and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Arranging the antecedents so that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 You're setting the puppy up for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=184.9s	184.9	 So they're learning what behaviors you do want them to do rather than them rehearsing them and then learning not to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 So in terms of teaching bite inhibition, I really suggest training your puppy every day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 Using a variety of different value reinforcers. So low value kibble
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=205.7s	205.7	 And if your puppy is really excited about food then slowly integrating different levels of reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=212.3s	212.3	 like high value food like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=214.5s	214.5	 freshly cooked steak or something like that and the way that you're going to teach your puppy to have a soft mouth is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 By feeding them treats during training when they're first very calm, but also very excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 So they're learning that even though they're very excited about playing with a toy when they go to put their mouth on you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=231.8s	231.8	 They can take the treats softly. So that's how I train it with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=236.2s	236.2	 with human interactions, but also by letting the puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=241.1s	241.1	 Interact and play with appropriate dogs not puppies and adult dogs that play rough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=246.6s	246.6	 But puppies and adult dogs that are going to tell the puppy that they're they're being hurt by the puppy if the puppy bites hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 but also by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=256.1s	256.1	 Interacting softly and calmly and playing appropriately so that puppy is really learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=262.5s	262.5	 how to interact with other dogs with their mouth without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=266.3s	266.3	 Biting them super hard. So that's my technique
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=270.7s	270.7	 that I use for for working on teaching puppies to not bite your hands and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=276.3s	276.3	 And also bite inhibition. So if they were to bite they're gonna bite super soft
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=281.9s	281.9	 So I do have a terrier mr. Tug and he has bitten me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=286.7s	286.7	 I have to admit that he had he had terrible back pain and as I was going down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=292.7s	292.7	 Feeling his back to see where it hurt he turned around and bit my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=296.7s	296.7	 But there was no mark on my hand. It didn't even hurt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 So that's what we're looking for in dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=304.7s	304.7	 We want dogs that tell us when they're feeling bad by growling and if they were to suddenly feel extreme pain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=312.5s	312.5	 That if they go to bite it's you know an inhibited bite and then what you have there is a dog that communicates and a safe dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 When they when there are they're scared or in pain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=324.2s	324.2	 another really important thing is of course building a trusting relationship with your dog and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 Exposing them, you know socialization and all that stuff also helps. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=335.3s	335.3	 What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put a video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=338.4s	338.4	 Of how to train your dog not to bite your hands at the end of this of this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=344.1s	344.1	 So you can watch the tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=345.9s	345.9	 I just want to reiterate that this video is not saying that one method is better than the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=352.1s	352.1	 What I am saying is that there are different ways of training this for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=357.1s	357.1	 When I've gone to help other trainers and they've learned Ian Dunbar's bite inhibition protocol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=364.1s	364.1	 They're very scared to try something new because they think that if they don't follow the protocol exactly step-by-step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=371.2s	371.2	 That they're gonna have a dog that if you slam their tail in a car door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 They're gonna turn around and take your leg off. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=378.5s	378.5	 That's why I'm making this video is that they're different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=382.3s	382.3	 There are different ways of training things and you can achieve the same result
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=386.3s	386.3	 The only reason that I train this other way is that I've found with my own
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=391.5s	391.5	 Private clients and helping other people and my own dogs that to really get reliably the dog not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=398.3s	398.3	 biting the hand or offering biting the hand when they're excited it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=402.7s	402.7	 By using errorless learning where they're they're never rehearsing or rehearsing the biting the hands less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=409.3s	409.3	 that really really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=411.6s	411.6	 speeds up the process and makes the dog less likely to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=417.0s	417.0	 Practice rehearsing the behavior. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=420.1s	420.1	 When with either technique or any technique if the clients not using management or prevention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=426.7s	426.7	 That's also going to completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=429.0s	429.0	 Ruin the training so they you know, let the puppy out of the crate and the puppy immediately starts biting their legs and they don't see that pattern
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=436.3s	436.3	 That it's every time they open the crate is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=439.3s	439.3	 The cue to bite your legs and then they stop the puppy biting in whatever way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=444.5s	444.5	 Positive reinforcement or punishment whatever they've rehearsed biting the legs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=448.8s	448.8	 So the number one reason that in my opinion that a puppy might continually bite is one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=455.4s	455.4	 It's their personality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=457.3s	457.3	 and genetics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=459.3s	459.3	 but and and and playing rough with litter mates or the breeder for eight weeks before you get them but also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=467.2s	467.2	 the the number one reason that clients do is that they're not using management and prevention and not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=473.0s	473.0	 Writing down all the times with a piece of paper and a pen the family writing down when the puppy tends to bite and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=480.0s	480.0	 Preventing and managing that from happening while they train the puppy what they do want the puppy to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=487.2s	487.2	 in these different situations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=489.4s	489.4	 The second myth in dog training that I want to talk about is teaching a dog to be safe and comfortable when you restrain them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=502.3s	502.3	 When I first got into dog training both techniques that were very common were
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=508.7s	508.7	 The but then the way that I train no biting and also for training a restraint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=513.8s	513.8	 What you would do is you hold the dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=516.0s	516.0	 This was 16 years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=517.5s	517.5	 You hold the dog the puppy and they struggle and struggle and struggle and then when they finally give up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=524.4s	524.4	 Then you let them go or they feel they they relax you let them go their body relaxes now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=531.9s	531.9	 the problem with that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=534.1s	534.1	 Is that it is it can be based on extinction and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=538.6s	538.6	 extinction can be very stressful and you have to do it again and again and generalize it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=544.1s	544.1	 There are ways

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=553.8s	553.8	 So every every every training situation is subjective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=557.8s	557.8	 So imagine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=559.2s	559.2	 There's a fearful puppy in a puppy class the trainer picks up the puppy the puppy's terrified

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=577.7s	577.7	 Where there's a puppy laying on the couch and they're all sleepy and then the you know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=583.5s	583.5	 The owner holds the puppy for a little bit and then lets the puppy go before they even think to struggle and then they build

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=594.0s	594.0	 restraining a puppy and then letting them go

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=615.8s	615.8	 Be a slippery slope into something that the dog is going to start to have an aversion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=621.2s	621.2	 To being held so maybe if they are held they're going to be like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=625.2s	625.2	 I just have to do nothing and then I get let go or they learn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=630.5s	630.5	 To avoid the situation completely so you might not be able to pick the dog up again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=636.0s	636.0	 Or when you go to you know restrain the dog or put on their leash they run away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=640.4s	640.4	 There are all these side effects that can happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=643.9s	643.9	 Because of the fact that there was some part of this behavior of the extinction process

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=661.1s	661.1	 Well for me, it's like I want to choose a technique that is the safest and most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=668.0s	668.0	 Likely for errors not to happen so there will be errors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=672.3s	672.3	 But the by breaking the steps up small enough again small approximations and arranging the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=680.0s	680.0	 Really setting the puppy up for success that they're going to see the stimulus or feel the stimulus that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=687.4s	687.4	 Situation happens and it happens in a way that they feel good, and they do the right behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=693.9s	693.9	 So that's the two things you're looking for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=696.5s	696.5	 Classical conditioning you're conditioning a positive emotional response where the dogs like this feels good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=701.4s	701.4	 I feel safe, and you're also teaching them what to do. Oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=705.1s	705.1	 We're being restrained. I need to be still and relax so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=710.6s	710.6	 the same with any technique you use if you're going to suddenly begin training in a situation where your dog is very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=718.6s	718.6	 Aroused and excited you're not going to have this success as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=723.0s	723.0	 Training the puppy or dog when they're comfortable and in a district a non distracting environment where the food is reinforcing to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=731.2s	731.2	 and you're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=733.2s	733.2	 Break the steps up small enough, so I'm going to attach the video of how I train this technique at the end of this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=740.4s	740.4	 So I'll have the two tutorials the one on how to teach your puppy not to bite and then the restraint and these are so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=747.2s	747.2	 important for puppies so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=749.6s	749.6	 To begin with to teach a restraint where the puppy is you know for someone who has no experience in dog training no experience in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=757.5s	757.5	 reading a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=759.0s	759.0	 Having the puppy go between your legs and just putting your hands on the puppy's chest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=762.5s	762.5	 That's a wonderful first start to teaching a restraint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=766.3s	766.3	 Of course if your puppy's sleeping next to you, and they are enjoying handling you can pet your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=772.4s	772.4	 But if there's food around you're really going to condition the handling in the no biting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=778.0s	778.0	 Exercises and the restraint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=780.4s	780.4	 Using positive reinforcement, so it's very obvious when you're using the food if your puppy's like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=785.9s	785.9	 I don't want to do that because they start to struggle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=788.1s	788.1	 You can just let them go and then work in small approximations of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=793.0s	793.0	 Reinforcing that behavior really wanting to be restrained and then start to add
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=799.1s	799.1	 Distractions that are exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=801.2s	801.2	 In a way that the dog can deal with it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=805.0s	805.0	 So again I want to reiterate that this video is about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=809.0s	809.0	 Pointing out that there are different ways of training and that I'm not saying that one method is better than the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=814.8s	814.8	 I'm simply saying why I specifically choose this method than the more commonly used method
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=821.5s	821.5	 done by dog trainers and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=823.9s	823.9	 For me what I found is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=827.8s	827.8	 It can go well, or it can go really badly so for example a dog could learn to be very confident
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=834.1s	834.1	 confident and comfortable being held or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=836.4s	836.4	 That example of the puppy class where the dog defecates themselves and has like a really traumatic experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=843.2s	843.2	 Or perhaps it's the first time that they've practiced aggression
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=847.9s	847.9	 so you hold the puppy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=850.2s	850.2	 The puppy doesn't give up and you have a puppy with that sort of personality and they start to become very very aggressive and start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=859.4s	859.4	 Biting your arms like aggressively and then what you're having to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=863.8s	863.8	 Is work, you know work on aggression issues now using extinction which for a new owner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=871.3s	871.3	 I really don't think they should be doing that as the first things that they do with their puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=875.8s	875.8	 I think that that but by going step by step and if the puppy has this personality that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=881.8s	881.8	 They address that in small steps rather than jumping right into making the puppy as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=887.6s	887.6	 Aggressive and fearful as they've ever been in their life and then trying to use extinction to work on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=894.1s	894.1	 restraint training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=896.7s	896.7	 In this tutorial I'm going to show you how I do a puppy restraint now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=901.2s	901.2	 It's very important that you don't do this with an adult dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=904.5s	904.5	 Especially a dog that's scared or aggressive because you could go too fast too quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=909.6s	909.6	 And there is the potential for scaring the dog or making the dog bite you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=914.4s	914.4	 So it's really important to teach the puppy to be restrained because as an adult if the dog has to go to the back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=921.6s	921.6	 And needs to be restrained for shots or has an injury and you know, you have to restrain your dog while they're getting medical care
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=929.6s	929.6	 It's really important that the dog finds it calm and relaxing rather than very scary in the moment that he needs to be restrained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=937.1s	937.1	 So the way that I like to teach this behavior is in small steps small successful steps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=942.5s	942.5	 So you're not scaring the puppy any time along the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=946.3s	946.3	 Step one build calm confidence when touched on different parts of the body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=951.6s	951.6	 You're just working on touching your puppy. Yeah, I'm using a calm marker and calm cheek delivery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=958.5s	958.5	 So what do I mean by that? Well, you're bringing the cheeks to the puppy very slowly and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=964.8s	964.8	 You want to also start training on the puppy's sleepy and not very excited. Yeah, so you touch the puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=973.2s	973.2	 Yeah, and then you give the puppy a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=976.5s	976.5	 awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=978.3s	978.3	 Yeah, good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=980.8s	980.8	 So you want to do it when your puppies laying down but also standing up because what can happen is if they're standing up and you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1198.1s	1198.1	 If at any point your puppy panics or gets overexcited I suggest taking it back a step to just touching yep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1206.5s	1206.5	 Feeding so your dog is confident and happy to have your hands on him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1212.1s	1212.1	 step five add distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1215.1s	1215.1	 Once your puppy is really relaxed and calm with being restrained when there are no distractions you can start to add distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1222.0s	1222.0	 So for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1223.5s	1223.5	 If you're in the park and you were holding your puppy and you saw a squirrel or another dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1227.6s	1227.6	 You might want to escape you and run towards the dog and that would make him frustrated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1232.1s	1232.1	 So I'm going to put a little distraction of treats down here. Yep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1235.7s	1235.7	 And then I'm going to say yep and feed my dog for understanding the concept of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1241.8s	1241.8	 You can't get those treats right now because I'm holding you now if your puppy struggles and squirms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1248.2s	1248.2	 You can put the treats further away or use a distraction that's less exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1252.4s	1252.4	 So maybe there's some kibble far away and you're feeding your dog hot dogs or cheese
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1258.0s	1258.0	 Yeah, for having the impulse control to not just squirm to go and get what he wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1263.0s	1263.0	 So this is a great exercise for dogs that are impulsive and they can't control their impulses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1271.0s	1271.0	 The idea is that you want your dog to understand that the best place to be is here being restrained with you. Yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1280.6s	1280.6	 Okay, and then you can release your dog to go and get the treats go get him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1287.6s	1287.6	 Step six add grooming and handling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1291.1s	1291.1	 First handle and groom your puppy in the way you will when he's restrained if he doesn't like it when he's loose and backs away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1298.6s	1298.6	 Then don't move on to restraining him and doing the same exercises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1320.6s	1320.6	 Yep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1323.4s	1323.4	 It may take many training sessions to get to this point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1327.8s	1327.8	 This golden doodle puppy used to be very mouthy and bitey when restrained until the family members worked hard on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1335.0s	1335.0	 Handling and restraint and you can see their efforts have paid off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1341.2s	1341.2	 Restraints training in a real-time training session. So the other game that I wanted to play with him is the restraint
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1349.7s	1349.7	 So most trainers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1352.8s	1352.8	 Well, I don't know anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1354.2s	1354.2	 But when I started training everybody did their strength where you hold the dog like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1359.7s	1359.7	 This was like 18 years ago, but I still see people doing this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1364.4s	1364.4	 so basically what you do is you hold the dog and then they struggle and struggle and then what they learn is by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1371.8s	1371.8	 stopping struggling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1373.2s	1373.2	 And and just giving up that's when you let them go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1377.0s	1377.0	 so that's based on something called extinction where the dog tries what they usually do and then when they fail and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1386.0s	1386.0	 They they try so hard and it never works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1388.3s	1388.3	 then they learn that the only way to get out of the grip is to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1393.7s	1393.7	 Just give up. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1396.6s	1396.6	 The problem with using extinction is that what can happen is the behavior can get more intense
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1402.2s	1402.2	 So if your puppy was whining and barking they might start screaming if your puppy was mouthing you they might start biting you harder and harder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1409.8s	1409.8	 Before they give up and then also it extinction. It doesn't just fix the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1417.4s	1417.4	 the puppy needs or the adult dog would need to have multiple sessions to generalize and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1423.8s	1423.8	 Like any type of behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1426.3s	1426.3	 What can happen is the behaviors can come back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1428.8s	1428.8	 So not only is the mouthing and biting part going to come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1431.8s	1431.8	 But the more intense behaviors could come back to like the screaming and the biting your arms harder than than they thought to do before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1439.2s	1439.2	 So I like to use an errorless learning type approach where you're just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1444.2s	1444.2	 Reinforcing the puppy for being restrained like this and we've already worked on this and he's very comfortable with handling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1450.7s	1450.7	 so I have a video on this and one of the techniques to begin with is simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1456.9s	1456.9	 Luring the puppy between your legs like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1460.2s	1460.2	 Whoo, so that you don't have to manhandle them like I did earlier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1465.5s	1465.5	 He really likes these treats. I should have used less exciting treats, but that's okay. There we go. And then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1473.8s	1473.8	 Sitting down like this. So if at any time the puppy wants to leave and they've had enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1479.1s	1479.1	 You just let go and they come out but the only way to get the treats is to do the restraint exercise. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1487.5s	1487.5	 I'm gonna lure him through here just so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1490.5s	1490.5	 Viewers don't manhandle their puppy to begin with so I've got him sitting like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1494.8s	1494.8	 And then I'm gonna put my hand on his chest and feed him treats like this good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1504.3s	1504.3	 Good and I can calmly pet him and this is gonna help calm your dog down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1509.9s	1509.9	 And also help if your dog gets overexcited out and about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1513.9s	1513.9	 This is gonna help calm them down where if you didn't work on this and then you try to restrain your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1520.2s	1520.2	 Out and about what can happen is that they can get over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1524.5s	1524.5	 Over excited by this restraint good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1529.1s	1529.1	 You're so good. I also like to use a calm marker working on this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1535.4s	1535.4	 Along with other calm behaviors good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1538.5s	1538.5	 So my calm marker marker is good like that and you can see that he he's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1545.4s	1545.4	 Heard that a few times already
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1548.1s	1548.1	 Good and you can get eye contact from your puppy if you wanted as well. I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1554.8s	1554.8	 Don't particularly want him looking at where the treats went and you can see he's really comfortable with me restraining him like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1561.7s	1561.7	 Then the thing that we're gonna work on in this training session now that we did a little warm-up is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1567.1s	1567.1	 Putting something out of reach so I put a treat there good and I can mark him good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1573.2s	1573.2	 Before he struggles to try and get the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1576.3s	1576.3	 Good, and then I can release him to it. Okay, go get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1580.6s	1580.6	 And that is gonna help say for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1582.8s	1582.8	 Your puppy or your adult dog wants to meet someone or do something and you prevent them from doing it by holding them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1590.2s	1590.2	 Picking them up or restraining them if they're a larger dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1594.3s	1594.3	 And that's going to be so helpful because they won't feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1598.2s	1598.2	 It's an impulse control exercise. So they won't feel like oh my gosh, I'm being punished
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1604.1s	1604.1	 Because I can't get to what I want to and this human being
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1608.1s	1608.1	 Is just depriving me of all the good stuff in life. So basically you're teaching them good that even though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1614.6s	1614.6	 They're being held like this. It's in their best interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1617.9s	1617.9	 Awesome, and you're conditioning that positive emotional response to being restrained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1623.7s	1623.7	 Rather than it being a frustrating thing. It's a calming thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1627.5s	1627.5	 Okay, go get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1630.3s	1630.3	 Good job, and I haven't worked on leave it with him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1633.0s	1633.0	 So what was happening there is I was reinforcing the absence of his choice to go toward the treat before he thought to go to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1640.8s	1640.8	 Towards the treat so as I put the treat down I fed him and then fed him at a high rate of reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1646.6s	1646.6	 And what that caused him to do was when I released him to the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1651.2s	1651.2	 He didn't actually want to go to get it which is great because what happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1656.0s	1656.0	 When you play games like this is that you reduce the dog's arousal and interest in going towards things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1663.3s	1663.3	 That they're excited about good. So for example, if you were doing this game with other dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1670.2s	1670.2	 Where your dog wanted to play with another puppy you're going to reduce that excitement about getting to whatever it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1677.3s	1677.3	 Good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1679.6s	1679.6	 Okay, go get it see how he's just sitting there get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1684.9s	1684.9	 There we go, awesome, okay, and we'll stop there and so that's enough for one training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1693.0s	1693.0	 Solving puppy biting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1696.4s	1696.4	 This video is about solving and managing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1699.5s	1699.5	 puppy mouthing and biting as well as teaching the puppy to become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1704.6s	1704.6	 Confident and relaxed when handled because most puppies when you reach for them and pet them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1711.3s	1711.3	 Excitedly or even just pet them calmly it can make the puppy aroused and also want to mouth at your hands or your clothes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1718.2s	1718.2	 Now puppies are very similar to human toddlers in that they're exploring the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1723.8s	1723.8	 Using their mouth now most toddlers use their hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1727.1s	1727.1	 But they also will put things into their mouths and when a puppy sees things they're naturally going to want to try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1733.4s	1733.4	 Putting that thing into their mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1735.5s	1735.5	 So if you reach for your puppy and you're touching your puppy the puppy wants to naturally do the same back to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1742.6s	1742.6	 But they're going to be using their mouth. So we need to train the puppies that when we reach and touch them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1748.4s	1748.4	 It's not a game of mouthing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1751.6s	1751.6	 It's simply that we're petting the dog in order to calm them down or just interact with them in a calm manner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1759.6s	1759.6	 If your puppy started to bite at your hands like this I suggest getting your puppy's attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1765.5s	1765.5	 And then say oh my goodness look what is that and points out a toy that already exists in the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1772.6s	1772.6	 so don't get a toy out of a new place like on top of a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1776.7s	1776.7	 Counter and give your puppy a toy because they could quickly learn they can get your attention by biting you to get access to toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1783.8s	1783.8	 They don't have but I suggest having some cool toys around that you interact with often
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1789.5s	1789.5	 The puppy likes and then get your puppy to play with those toys and interact with those toys when he's feeling like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1796.8s	1796.8	 Checking things out in the environment with his mouth or chewing on things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1802.0s	1802.0	 When you first bring your puppy home you want to really create a reinforcement history for playing with his toys right from the start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1810.0s	1810.0	 Don't just leave the toys out and hope he'll choose those over your socks and shoes or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1815.5s	1815.5	 Better yet pick up your socks and shoes so your puppy is more likely to spend the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1821.2s	1821.2	 Playing with his toys that you want him to play with rather than your stuff or your clothes your hair and your hands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1829.0s	1829.0	 So as you can see this pup really enjoys playing with his toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1833.9s	1833.9	 managing and preventing mouthing and biting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1836.5s	1836.5	 Pet and handle your puppy calmly and gently instead of petting your puppy excitedly play with a toy with your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1844.0s	1844.0	 Write a list of the times your puppy bites and avoid putting your puppy in those situations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1849.2s	1849.2	 Unless you plan to train your puppy if your puppy becomes over excited and mouthy you can put him in his pen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1855.5s	1855.5	 Where he can play with his toys?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1858.0s	1858.0	 We can teach puppies what to do when being petted handled and groomed by setting up short training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1864.2s	1864.2	 You can use a portion of your puppy's breakfast and dinner to work on handling exercises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1869.7s	1869.7	 And I suggest working on them daily when you first get your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1874.1s	1874.1	 Step one touch and feed a treat at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1879.7s	1879.7	 The reason that you want to feed and touch at the same time is that if you have a mouthy puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1884.9s	1884.9	 And you just reach for your puppy your puppy might either lick or bite at your hand as you're reaching for your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1890.6s	1890.6	 Or if you have a timid puppy you reach for your puppy and your puppy might back away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1894.7s	1894.7	 And that's not the first thing you want your puppy to do when you reach for them in a training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1899.9s	1899.9	 So I suggest starting out every training session by feeding and touching at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1904.8s	1904.8	 So if you're going to be touching your puppy's feet you touch and feed at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1910.1s	1910.1	 Practice touching the top of the head and you're doing this all calmly so the puppy isn't finding it overwhelming at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1917.0s	1917.0	 So now I'm touching on the back of his shoulders like this and feeding and then once you've done that and your puppy is seeming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1923.6s	1923.6	 Pretty contented to get his treat while you touch him at the same time you can move on to the next step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1928.4s	1928.4	 Which is making the petting the predictor of food because at the first step you're simply teaching him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1935.3s	1935.3	 What's going to happen to him while he's not doing anything?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1938.9s	1938.9	 And then the second step is teaching him that the actual petting is what predicts that the food is going to come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1945.8s	1945.8	 Step two touch your puppy say good or click and then move to feed a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1953.2s	1953.2	 So I'm going to touch him say good and then give him a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1961.7s	1961.7	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1965.8s	1965.8	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1970.4s	1970.4	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1972.6s	1972.6	 Once your puppy is calm and relaxed with you placing your hand on your puppy you can also practice stroking gestures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1988.4s	1988.4	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1991.4s	1991.4	 Step three add duration to the handling and teach the puppy to ignore the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=1997.5s	1997.5	 The third step you might not actually get to in the first few training sessions because it requires a couple of other skills to be taught to the puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2004.5s	2004.5	 One either that the puppy can look away from treats that you're holding like that good or that your puppy can offer you eye contact or at least look up at you when you make a kissy noise or an attention noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2017.5s	2017.5	 Good like that, and I did not know that he would do all that so perfectly you're so clever. Okay, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2024.8s	2024.8	 After doing step two where you reach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2027.4s	2027.4	 Mark good and then feed you can start to wait until your puppy offers you eye contact or doesn't look at the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2034.7s	2034.7	 Because you don't want your puppy to only think that handling is okay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2039.1s	2039.1	 If he's looking at food because when the food becomes out of the picture then suddenly you might get the mouthing and biting or

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2050.7s	2050.7	 Touch your puppy calmly and wait for your puppy to stop looking at the food or look up at your eyes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2056.3s	2056.3	 And if that doesn't happen within two to three seconds you can make your attention noise or say your puppy's name if that's his cue to look at you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2066.0s	2066.0	 Good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2075.0s	2075.0	 Like that good and then I mark it and then go to feed a treat you want to make sure when you mark your puppy for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2082.1s	2082.1	 Calm behaviors like handling that you don't race to get that treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2086.3s	2086.3	 Into the picture because what you can create is a puppy that's getting excited about the treat coming so you want to mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2093.4s	2093.4	 Pause and then feed the treat step four keep changing the picture

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2102.1s	2102.1	 Standing laying down as well as while you're standing above the puppy or to the side of the puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2109.1s	2109.1	 It's really important that during this training you handle your puppy calmly however
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2114.1s	2114.1	 You should do some training sessions where you simulate what other people might do to your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2120.2s	2120.2	 Before you can tell the person that that's not an appropriate way to pet a puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2124.5s	2124.5	 If your puppy opens his mouth gets excited leans away or backs away go back to step one where you touch and feed at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2134.4s	2134.4	 If your puppy is still too excited then stop training and wait until another time to train when he is calm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2141.6s	2141.6	 Here you can see my puppy ducks when I try to touch him on the head so I go back to step one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2146.7s	2146.7	 I'll go back to step two and then I'll go back to step three and then I'll go back to step four
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2152.4s	2152.4	 I'll go back to step five and then I'll go back to step six and then I'll go back to step seven
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2158.3s	2158.3	 I'll go back to step eight and then I'll go back to step nine and then I'll go back to step ten
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2163.3s	2163.3	 So I go back to step one of touching and feeding at the same time if you have a puppy that leans away or backs away from you when you try to touch him you can play this game as the first step where you move away from your puppy and to reach the treat the puppy's face rubs against your hand to get the treat in your hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2172.0s	2172.0	 So you can hold your hand under his chin as he reaches for the treat or have your hand above his head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2178.6s	2178.6	 Then you can turn it into a petting gesture and start to pet him before you give him the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2187.3s	2187.3	 Solving biting at clothing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2190.3s	2190.3	 Today I'm going to be talking about how to teach your puppy not to mouth or bite at your clothing accessories or your hair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2197.5s	2197.5	 Good puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2199.3s	2199.3	 What I've already worked on with this pup I've only had him a few days is working on a calm settle for food which he's doing right now so I can talk to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2207.9s	2207.9	 Now naturally when I train dogs I never want to let them rehearse the undesirable behavior so in my videos you'll never see the dogs doing the things that they're not supposed to do I only show you the small approximations of how to train the dog what you do want them to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2225.1s	2225.1	 But in this case because I get a lot of requests of people saying hey how come you're never using untrained dogs it's because when you train with positive reinforcement it always looks like the dog is already trained because you're breaking the steps up small enough that the dog can succeed every step of the way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2242.9s	2242.9	 So this puppy has never had any training with mouthing and biting and I will show you that my puppy does mouth and bite at clothing when it moves around but it's not very good training to do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2256.1s	2256.1	 On this rare occasion I will show the dog rehearsing the undesirable behavior this is because the behavior of tugging is one I do want for when playing with tug toys in the future also showing this specific undesirable behavior is not stressful for this dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2270.9s	2270.9	 Seeing what the dog does in a situation before training actually makes the dog more likely to do those behaviors in the future instead a smarter training plan is training in small easily achievable steps where the dog doesn't even have a thought to do the undesirable behavior again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2289.1s	2289.1	 As you can see this is a normal puppy puppies naturally want to grab at anything that moves fast or is dangling like a dress or your hair or some jewelry or this dishcloth or a sweater sleeve as you're putting it on so this is a normal puppy but you'll see during the training the puppy is not going to be doing this type of behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2311.2s	2311.2	 The point of this exercise is to teach the puppy that when things are dangling around it means to ignore them and you can still play tug with your dog but it's really important to put that on a verbal cue like get it and always say get it before you offer your dog a toy to tug on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2329.4s	2329.4	 So they don't get the wrong idea that anything that's dangling in their face is fair game to be tugged on in this exercise you can either use a clicker or a verbal marker so you can either click and then feed a treat or I have a nice calm marker good that means I'm going to slowly deliver the treat to the puppy like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2347.5s	2347.5	 The game is pretty simple you start off with distractions that are very easy for the puppy to ignore so with this sweater for example if the puppy is over here settling or you could have your puppy on a leash and you could have a helper the helper is just going to show the sweater and move it slowly and as you move it you mark and then feed a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2370.4s	2370.4	 So the puppy is associating that when the sweater moves and they stay still they get a click and a treat and basically you're training the puppy to do nothing when they see this happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2385.4s	2385.4	 When your puppy is having success you can start to make things more exciting so I'm going to move the sweater past the puppy like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2392.9s	2392.9	 Good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2401.9s	2401.9	 Good job

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2423.0s	2423.0	 To set your puppy up for success

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2474.1s	2474.1	 Good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2490.3s	2490.3	 Good job

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2497.8s	2497.8	 Good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2518.8s	2518.8	 Good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2529.1s	2529.1	 You can also use a kissy noise or the recall if you see your puppy going over to someone else to pull on their shoelaces or to get their clothing you can make your kissy noise attention noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2540.5s	2540.5	 Or call your puppy to you so that your puppy isn't practicing that behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2546.5s	2546.5	 When you see your puppy get interested in something like someone's shuffling feet or shoelaces interrupt your puppy and redirect him to something you do want him to be doing like playing with his toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2557.2s	2557.2	 Then make a mental note to work on that specific distraction in a training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2562.3s	2562.3	 Here's a list of the steps. Step one, mark as the distraction happens. Step two, mark after the distraction begins. Step three, add more time before you mark. Step four, add difficulty and variety to the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2586.3s	2586.3	 For the most successful training you want to work on the distractions before the puppy is exposed to them in real life. For example, having your kids move in front of your puppy for the first time in a training session and reinforcing your puppy for remaining calm as it happens. Beginning first by having the kids simply walking past your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2608.3s	2608.3	 Leg biting. This video is on the topic of teaching your puppy not to bite your legs or clothing when you're walking around or moving around. And I will link a video in the description below on how to solve unwanted behaviors so you can watch that if this doesn't make sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2628.3s	2628.3	 But the important thing is teaching your puppy what you do want him to do. So if you notice that your puppy is going after your clothing obsessively and it's one of the major problems you're having, I would focus on that as one of the major things that you work on from day one so that it doesn't become an annoying issue that is hard to get rid of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2648.3s	2648.3	 A lot of people ask what should I do in the moment that it happens? Now it's important not to let the behavior get rehearsed in the moment that it's happening, but the really important thing is to train the puppy what to do. So when you notice that the puppy is going after your clothes and you say, oh, this keeps happening, I need to do something about it, then choose a moment, not at that moment, but when the puppy is calm to work on this behavior. If you try to train through the time when the dog is going to be able to walk around,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2678.3s	2678.3	 and the dog is obsessed with your clothing, you're not going to have as much success as if you say, I need to jot this down and I need to work on it in a training session when the puppy is calm. So I'm using low value kibble. If you have a puppy that's super excited about kibble, I'm going to show you two exercises. This one is with the puppy laying down in a saddle and I'll link a video in the description below on how to train a saddle but low value food will work very well for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2706.3s	2706.3	 And then a second part of the exercise is where I'm moving and the puppy's moving. So if your puppy wasn't settling, you could work on that exercise first and then work on the saddle as a first step to this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2721.3s	2721.3	 Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to move and as I move, I'm going to mark and reinforce the puppy by dropping a treat calmly between the puppy's paws. So at first it can be very calm, but later on I might move faster to give the puppy the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2740.3s	2740.3	 So I'm going to change the camera angle in a second, but right now all I'm going to do is stand up, mark the puppy, good, and then drop the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2750.3s	2750.3	 Now these, this scenario, these pants that I'm wearing, vet tech pants that I like to wear around the house and in the mornings when I train my dogs, they're very flowy and he likes to go for those instead of my jeans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2766.3s	2766.3	 So one reason he's doing so good is that he's calm right now, but what I'm going to do is take steps, good, and mark as I take the step, good, and feed a treat, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2778.3s	2778.3	 So what I'm doing is reinforcing the absence of the behavior that I don't like and the behavior I do like is him being calm around the stimulus that I don't want him to go after my pants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2791.3s	2791.3	 So the wonderful thing about having the dog settling or sitting is that it's very obvious to see when they're too excited because they'll get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2799.3s	2799.3	 So if the dog gets up, you need to slow down the training. You also don't want to make it more and more exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2805.3s	2805.3	 So if he's good with one step, then two steps and three steps, then running around, you want to keep going back to where it's easy for the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2813.3s	2813.3	 So you don't mess up and the puppy gets overexcited. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2819.3s	2819.3	 So I'm going to take a couple steps. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2824.3s	2824.3	 Jiggle the fabric a little bit. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2831.3s	2831.3	 Good. When the puppy's doing really well, you can make the distraction, wait a little bit, then mark and feed the treat or do the distraction for longer increments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2842.3s	2842.3	 So you might walk a step and mark as you make the first step, but then you might make a couple more steps before marking and reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2850.3s	2850.3	 To generalize the behavior, I'm going to use a couple different materials that are more flowy and work on the same exercise with the pup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2859.3s	2859.3	 Now, if he started getting overexcited, I'm just going to end the session and then work on it at another time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2865.3s	2865.3	 So first, this shirt can simulate a dress. Good, because I'm not going to wear a dress in this tutorial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2873.3s	2873.3	 I might get someone else to do that. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2881.3s	2881.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2885.3s	2885.3	 And the reason that my puppy is being so good is that I'm making the steps small enough so that he can succeed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2891.3s	2891.3	 I've chosen the correct reinforcement, which is the lower value kibble that he is enjoying, and I've chosen the time of day that he's pretty calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2900.3s	2900.3	 So he's already enjoyed playing with my other dogs. He had a nap and now he's kind of just settled and interested enough in the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2911.3s	2911.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2915.3s	2915.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2922.3s	2922.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2923.3s	2923.3	 This is enough for one training session, and I'm going to show you the next exercise in a little bit when I have some higher value treats and the puppy's had a little break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2933.3s	2933.3	 But I'm also going to increase criteria right now to show you what to do if the puppy does get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2939.3s	2939.3	 So you might have a helper that's a little over enthusiastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2944.3s	2944.3	 And there he gets up. So that was too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2947.3s	2947.3	 And I'm just going to lure him back into the down position and then go back to making it super easy for him like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2956.3s	2956.3	 Good job. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2959.3s	2959.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2962.3s	2962.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2968.3s	2968.3	 Yay, it's all finished. Come on, let's go outside. You need a break to go to the bathroom?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2972.3s	2972.3	 Puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2975.3s	2975.3	 For this exercise, I like to use the clicker because the puppy is going to be moving with me and I can mark precisely that moment that the puppy's in the position next to my side and I can mark the puppy for moving with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2988.3s	2988.3	 So I actually worked on this exercise for a minute or so yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2992.3s	2992.3	 I've had the puppy for four days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=2995.3s	2995.3	 And so to get the puppy in the position, I'm going to drop a treat behind me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3000.3s	3000.3	 And as the puppy catches up, I'm going to mark before he gets to me at first and then block him from getting ahead of me by feeding him the treat that he wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3010.3s	3010.3	 So if your puppy was worried about being blocked like that, it probably means that he doesn't want the treat that you're giving him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3018.3s	3018.3	 Good job. So I'm going to mark him moving with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3021.3s	3021.3	 And I'm also going to mark him standing at my side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3024.3s	3024.3	 So not only are you working on teaching the puppy to walk at your side, but you're also reinforcing that puppy for not biting your pants as you're moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3035.3s	3035.3	 So I like to use a coffee table or a chair and work first with the dog on the inside, marking and reinforcing for standing at your side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3046.3s	3046.3	 Take a step forward, mark and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3049.3s	3049.3	 If the puppy thinks to lay down, you can put a treat out ahead of him to get him up again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3054.3s	3054.3	 So he's looking for those treats. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3057.3s	3057.3	 Then when the puppy is doing really well, you can increase how long you walk and you can also start hiding where the treat is so that your puppy isn't just staring up at the treats,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3068.3s	3068.3	 but he's walking at your side and seeing your legs moving and you there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3073.3s	3073.3	 And that when he looks at that, that is he's finding it reinforcing to walk at your side without biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3080.3s	3080.3	 If you just have the treat there in the picture, the whole training session, you know, always when there's no treat, he's going to start biting your legs again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3088.3s	3088.3	 So it's really important to remove the treat from the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3092.3s	3092.3	 So he's already had one training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3094.3s	3094.3	 That's why I can show you this next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3096.3s	3096.3	 But the first step in the training session that I already did was just marking and reinforcing him for walking at my side like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3104.3s	3104.3	 So now I can hide my hand behind my back and get that same behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3109.3s	3109.3	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3114.3s	3114.3	 He almost thought to bite the edge of the table, didn't you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3120.3s	3120.3	 OK, so that went really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3123.3s	3123.3	 Now I can work on it with the leash attached to him because he also likes to bite at his leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3130.3s	3130.3	 Now I'm going to work on the same exercise, but with the leash attached to the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3135.3s	3135.3	 So I've got the clicker and the leash in my right hand to have the puppy on my left side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3141.3s	3141.3	 And I'm going to throw a treat back here to lure the puppy back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3146.3s	3146.3	 And then as he catches up with me, I can mark and reinforce and play the same game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3153.3s	3153.3	 So by already doing the game, he's going to be less likely to want to bite on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3158.3s	3158.3	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3159.3s	3159.3	 And at first it can be very simple like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3162.3s	3162.3	 And then later on, it can be more exaggerated where the leash is moving around more like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3170.3s	3170.3	 Good, good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3172.3s	3172.3	 You can also practice having the puppy follow you where the leash is right in front of his face like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3178.3s	3178.3	 Because at some point, maybe your puppy will pull and then you'll have to get your puppy back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3184.3s	3184.3	 And as you're getting your puppy back to you, the leash is going to be right there in front of his face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3188.3s	3188.3	 And he might be a little frustrated because he didn't get to go to say hi to the aggressive dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3193.3s	3193.3	 And he might bite at the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3195.3s	3195.3	 So he's just getting used to seeing the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3198.3s	3198.3	 I can also practice switching it over to the other side like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3203.3s	3203.3	 Pop, pop, pop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3205.3s	3205.3	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3208.3s	3208.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3209.3s	3209.3	 And I chose, as I said, I chose the correct time of day that he's not too overexcited by the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3217.3s	3217.3	 Thank you so much for watching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpscjDrz8tg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=107&pp=iAQB&t=3219.3s	3219.3	 If you'd like to support my work, don't forget to like this video and write a comment.
