https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 You can sit on a couch and put one foot out ahead of you and the other one next to the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=10.9s	10.9	 couch like that. So the dog is highly likely to go under your leg and it's as though you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=16.3s	16.3	 took a step forward and then simply switch feet. So it's like you're taking steps like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=21.8s	21.8	 that. Good legs! Good job! And you can lure your dog underneath and as your dog starts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 to follow the hand signal like that. Good job! I'm doing two at a time here and they've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 never worked together doing this. But I wanted to go back and show you what it's like. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 they look a little bit untrained. But basically once they start to do it you can add a verbal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 cue and my cue is legs. So I say go legs and then lure them underneath my legs and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=50.5s	50.5	 eventually it's just the foot coming out that gets the dog to go under. Tug go legs. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=56.5s	56.5	 then you can start to stand up. Go legs. Good! Go legs. Good! Go legs. Tug go legs. Good!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=65.3s	65.3	 You can also teach your dogs to go around you while you're standing up. So you hold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=69.2s	69.2	 your feet together and away from the couch and then you just lure the dog underneath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=73.8s	73.8	 your legs like this. Good job! Ready? Go around. Tug go around. Good! Good job Tug! Go around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 Ready? Cloud go around. Tug go around. Cloud go around. Good! Tug is a little confused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=95.1s	95.1	 And now standing up. Are you ready? Go around. Cloud go around. Tug go around. Good! You

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=109.9s	109.9	 flower pots so your dog weaves around flower pots when you say a verbal cue or you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=115.4s	115.4	 use gallons of water. So we have these cones here but you don't need to buy cones. You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=123.5s	123.5	 can use something around the house. And then this is just a pole that I bought at the hardware
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 store and duct taped the lid of a coffee container on top. And then I have a video on how to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=135.7s	135.7	 train targeting using a stick that has food in it which I learned from Mary Ray, an amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=142.7s	142.7	 trainer. So I'm just going to put the food in the target stick and he's already trained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=147.1s	147.1	 to follow the target stick and I'm going to say get it and lure him around the cones like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=151.7s	151.7	 this. Good! So you want to train your dog to follow the target stick with duration before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 you start to do this exercise. Good! And basically with a target stick you're going to use it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=167.1s	167.1	 as you would if you were luring the dog with a hand target or food. You gradually teach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 the dog that with different behaviors the target stick gets faded away either by small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=181.2s	181.2	 approximations so the target stick might get higher up. Go get it! Or you can use a stick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=188.5s	188.5	 to follow it. The target stick might get higher up or further away. So here it's higher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 up and he's still doing the behavior or maybe I use it to point. Go weave! Cloud, go weave!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=199.8s	199.8	 Good! Go weave! Good! Like that. Awesome! Good job! So I'm going to add the cue, go

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=213.8s	213.8	 lure him around that cone. Good! Ready? Cloud, go weave! Go weave! Whoops! And I made a mistake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=224.2s	224.2	 there so I'm going to try again. He did follow the target stick and he doesn't know what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=229.7s	229.7	 I want so I'm going to give him the treat, the benefit of the doubt and then I'm going

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 while I'm looking at the camera and filming but you can see that it can build his interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=250.7s	250.7	 in moving faster. Good! However, sometimes you might want to build their excitement for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=257.7s	257.7	 a target stick and others you might want to calm them down. So I would tug my other dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZlN4E3Ll2U&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=58&pp=iAQB&t=262.4s	262.4	 here on the couch. He would get way too excited. Good! If I were to do that with the target
