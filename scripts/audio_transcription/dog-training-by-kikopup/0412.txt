https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 and a tutorial on training eye contact and using your dog's name to get your dog's attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 The positive interrupter is an attention noise that you can use to get your puppy's attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 and to also stop them doing an undesirable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 This staffie is having his first training session on the positive interrupter, or attention noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 At first I was clicking the puppy for offering eye contact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 clicking the exact moment the puppy's pupils met mine, and then feeding a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 Then I started to make the attention noise and click as the puppy's eyes met mine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 If the puppy didn't look up, I would make another noise to get the puppy's attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 so I could click the eye contact and reinforce with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 It's a good idea to keep training sessions very short with your new puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYWC8aDe5_w&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=413&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 This training session was only 30 seconds long.
