https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 So I'm going to ask the uncle to sit, yes, and then you can give the treat as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Good job. Now I'm going to ask for two. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 And then I'm going to go over and feed this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 I don't know if you know you're on a mat. It might help if you're on a mat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 You've already done this probably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 Have you already done this though?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 Yeah, because I have three dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 Yeah, but not everyone who has three dogs does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 Jovan, you're sitting still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 Down. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 And for dogs that are really excited about, oh, they can't wait until you get over there to give them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 If the treat always comes from the ground, so I'm not going to give the dog the treat like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 the treat is always going to come from down here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 They're going to be looking for down there, or maybe you're going to drop it so the treat drops down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 And then you can get a dog over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Perfect. It's going to come rather than, oh my god, I got it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 With this, I haven't given a cue, so I'm just reinforcing, if I'm working with this dog, you lay down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 If you get up, I'm probably going to ask you to lay down somewhere else,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 so the best thing you can do when I'm working with this dog is lay down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 The problem with that is if you wanted to do two tricks with two dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 if you don't reinforce one of the dogs enough, they're going to start laying down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 and you're going to think, hmm, laying down won't work because you're ignoring me, you're not giving me food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 So just to counteract that, keep giving your dog eye contact, the one that you're working with that you think is going to settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 But settling is much better than other things that they could be doing when you're working with two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 which is like running away and doing their own thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 Another great thing is every time you give your dog a treat for something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 what's in there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 Every time you give your dog a treat for something, you can touch them just before they get the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 So you can use your hospital conditioning in the training session,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 and you click, your dog does something, click, pet, and then treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 And the same with their dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 For clients, if they have a very handshy dog, you're going to pet them to the kibble,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 and then when they're getting into it, you can start waiting for calmer, calmer behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 It's really easy for, if you have a dog that's over-aroused by food, it's really easy to build it back up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 so you don't have to worry like, oh, I don't want my dog to lose his excitement over food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 because then he won't do his tricks as well, or he won't do his many.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 It's easy to get it back just by moving the food quickly or exciting the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 That's another great exercise for settling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 So, if your dog's settling, another dog walks towards yours, and then another dog runs towards yours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 I mean, obviously you're not going to let a loose dog run at your dog while they're settling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 but that's another perfect behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 Okay, that's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 And then you can take your dog to an agility trial and settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 Splash!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 For the first time I took Splash to an agility trial, she screamed because she saw little dogs running,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 and for some reason she really liked it, and it was scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 So, how I worked through Splash being scared, like overly excited about little dogs running, was settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 So, she'd settle, look at the little dogs, get a little massage, go back a little bit, go closer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 We started, you know, 50 feet away, whatever they call it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 What do you call them?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 Meters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 Meters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 50 meters away, and then back a little bit closer, a little bit away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 So, we could settle and we could watch the little dogs running around and she didn't care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 So, the settle can really help with behavior modification,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 because it's like you built this calmness and then you put it into the environment that you wanted it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 Hello!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 Hello!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 Hello!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=269.0s	269.0	 So, the out-roam is one that is really mellow,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 and then you can get them excited when you want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ohcISwQJ4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=457&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 Hey!
