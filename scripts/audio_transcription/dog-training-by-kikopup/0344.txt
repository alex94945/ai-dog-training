https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 In this tutorial I'm going to teach you how to teach a really important safety behavior to your puppy or your adult dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Basically, when you reach for a dog to grab their collar or grab their harness, a lot of dogs find that really intimidating and scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 So we can actually train them to enjoy finding having their collar grabbed or their harness grabbed a really reinforcing experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 so that in an emergency, if you need to catch your dog while he's loose and frightened and maybe hurt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 or if a neighbor or a stranger is going to catch your dog, they're not going to find it this strange, intimidating experience to suddenly be grabbed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 A lot of dogs don't like having their collar grabbed. It either makes them overexcited, mouthy, or makes them want to scuttle away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 By repeating this exercise over and over again, you will condition a new emotional response in your dog to love having his collar grabbed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 Step 1. Reach, say yes, then feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 So the first step is simply reaching towards the puppy or the dog and marking with a verbal marker like the word, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 So I'm going to reach, yes, and then feed the treat. Yes. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 And I can do it from standing up too. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 If you have a very shy dog or puppy, you can stand to the side of the puppy and reach from the side at first so they're not feeling intimidated by you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 Yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 If your puppy's doing great, you can start reaching from the top and from the front. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 Yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=103.0s	103.0	 Step 2. Touch the collar, say yes, then feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 The next step is touching the puppy's collar. Yes. So as you touch the collar, say yes, and then move to give a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 If you do it both at the same time, the puppy might not be understanding that it's the touching of the collar that's meaning the treat is coming, but just your hand moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 So you don't want to teach your puppy to love your hand moving to give him a treat. You want to teach him that it's all about the collar. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 That means the treat is coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 If your puppy is really mouthy or bitey and you can't even get your hand near their collar without them biting you, then you can first start out this game by feeding and then touching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 What you will be doing is showing your dog what you're about to do without giving them a chance to get mouthy or frightened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 When your dog becomes comfortable with this exercise, then move on to reaching first and grabbing before saying yes and then feeding. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 Try it in all different types of scenarios. So Lumos has been laying down while I reached to touch his collar, and I've been reaching with my left hand and doing the same gesture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=178.0s	178.0	 Change it up. So now I'm going to move over here. Yes. And grabbing with my right hand. Yes. Good boy. Yes. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 This is teaching your dog to trust you. So even if you think your dog might be okay with having his collar grabbed, you want him to really love it and enjoy it and really trust you that when you're grabbing his collar, it's all about your connection with him and you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 And it's got nothing to do with you trying to intimidate your dog. Hey, Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 Step three. Teach your puppy to feel comfortable being led by the collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 Another thing you can teach your dog is to be led by their collar. So even though I don't use a collar to walk my dog on because I'm worried about it damaging their neck, at some point in their life, they might actually have their collar grabbed and have someone lead them by their collar, say if they got loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 So it's a really important safety behavior. So I'm going to teach that to Lumos right now. I'm going to grab his collar and then I'm going to put a little bit of pressure on it towards me. Yes. And I'm going to mark the moment that he moves towards me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 If your puppy is really scared of you touching their collar, you can simply pull on it a little bit. Yes. And say yes as they feel a little bit of pressure on their neck. Yes. Good boy. Yes. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 He's doing too good. Yes. So say for example, I don't know, he's really nervous or frightened. He's loose. He doesn't have his harness on in the street. I need to get him. I'm going to get his collar. Yes. And lead him away without him making him more scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 If your dog looks nervous or unhappy when you pull forwards on his collar, you can use food to lure him forwards and teach him what you want him to do first. Then when he is comfortable, you can practice without the food. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwJ1FiZxTA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=345&pp=iAQB&t=302.0s	302.0	 If your puppy looks fearful, backs away or becomes mouthy, go back a step to either just reaching or feeding and touching at the same time. If you have an aggressive dog, a dog that has bitten or a dog that does not like being touched, get help from a professional trainer first.
