https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yPMgeh5wVA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=37&pp=iAQB&t=4.2s	4.2	 Basically, you just lower the dog's head down like this and the butt should pop up but not every dog does that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yPMgeh5wVA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=37&pp=iAQB&t=10.7s	10.7	 So I'm gonna throw a treat like this go get it and what I'm gonna begin with first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yPMgeh5wVA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=37&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 Is just getting him to back up a little bit
