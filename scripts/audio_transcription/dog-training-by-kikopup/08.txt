https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Here you can see we're working on the concept that if something the dog wants
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=3.8s	3.8	 leaves the area that the dog's supposed to stay in, the dog should stay behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=8.2s	8.2	 and not follow the thing that they want to get. To do this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 you click and feed your dog as you leave the barrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=14.8s	14.8	 before the dog has a chance to leave the barrier himself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 and then you wait the dog out and see if the dog will stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=21.9s	21.9	 as you move forward. If your dog does follow you over the barrier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 simply encourage your dog back quickly and then try again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 but this time make it easier for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=34.5s	34.5	 Here you can see I'm making it easier for Trish by stopping, reinforcing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 and then moving forwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=47.5s	47.5	 The next time I'm going to wait to see if she thinks to stop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeI5iTakbB8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=9&pp=iAQB&t=50.8s	50.8	 before clicking and coming back to reinforce her.
