https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This is my dog training tip for today. How to teach your dog to be caught when they're loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 I was just at the park this morning and there was a loose Shiba Inu that the owner had been trying to catch for 15 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 But basically the problem the owner was having is every time she'd reach down for the dog, the dog would scuttle out of the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Because this is a very intimidating gesture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 Capturing a loose little dog is very different than catching a big dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 A big dog, a person is naturally going to grab their collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 But with a little dog, usually a person is going to grab them from the sides.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 And Kiko pretty much hates that technique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 But by pairing it with reinforcement, by pairing being caught with reinforcement, you can actually get your dog to love being caught.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 So I'm going to show you how to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 It's easier if you have a helper who can click for you or you can use a marker word like yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 So I'm going to reach, yes, and give her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 That was a big one, oops, that was for splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 So I'm going to do that again, reach, yes, and give her a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 I'll show you with a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 So you're conditioning your dog to love being grabbed with your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 Now I'm going to do a two-handed one so I can't use my clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 But yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 And at first you're going to start out really slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 Your dog's probably not going to be wanting to be grabbed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 So just a yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 Your hand's yes coming for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 And Kiko's worked on it a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 Another way of capturing a little dog who doesn't like to be grabbed is by teaching them to rest their chin in your hand when you present your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 So for Kiko, she doesn't like to be grabbed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 So I've taught her that when I put my hand out like this, the best thing she can do is put her head in it, then I can grab her collar and pick her up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 Or if I were to just grab her at the park, she might scuttle out of the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 So to teach the chin rest, where you put your hand out and the dog puts their chin in it, all you have to do is hold a treat out to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 And as you put your hand under their chin, you say yes and give them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 Do that again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 Give them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 The third time you're not going to have a treat in your hand, you're going to have a pretend treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 So I'm going to put the pretend treat in my hand as the dog goes to look at it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 Show them there's no treat, but they still get one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 The next step to that is holding the treat further up on your arm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 And then see if the dog will offer it themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 And then the final one is hiding this hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 Now that one takes a couple, you know, that's going to take a couple of training sessions, but it's a really great trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 So when you need to capture your little dog, you just put your hand out, they come to it, you grab them and pick them up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 Most dogs, when you grab their collar, they tend to panic because it's just not a normal thing to be captured by your neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 But you can teach your dog to love being captured by their neck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 And then the way you would do this, with a dog that's not too shy, you would just touch their collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=194.0s	194.0	 And give them a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 Touch their collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 Give them a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 Grab the collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 Give them a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 If it was a shy, oh, good girl, keep going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 If it was a shyer dog, you might just reach at them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 And give them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 Give them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 And give them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 Getting them used to being reached for, because this is pretty scary if you're a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 You don't want to do this exercise with your dog on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 You want them to be able to escape you if they get a little nervous, because it's kind of scary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 You don't really, humans even, don't like to be reached for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 Stop immediately if your dog looks fearful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 Lose this interest in the treat or becomes aroused and mouthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 That is a sign that you're pushing them too quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=241.0s	241.0	 Remember to have the dog off leash and not cornered so they are choosing 100% on their own to participate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 or the dog could feel trapped and become defensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 So once your dog loves being grabbed by their collar, you can practice standing up and grabbing them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 And maybe approaching them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 Another behavior, if you've mastered that, is dogs don't like being led by their collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 That can actually make a dog bite you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 If the dog is in a dangerous situation and they're loose, you need to move that dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 And if it's your dog, you want your dog to be really safe if someone's going to grab them by their collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 So to teach that, you grab their collar, stand up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 It's easier if they're standing up and you put a little bit of pressure on their collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQvERQoHvgg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=553&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 This is just teaching a dog, when I pull on your collar, it's not a bad thing, I just want you to move with me.
