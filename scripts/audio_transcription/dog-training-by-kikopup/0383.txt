https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 Step 1. Teach your dog leave it basics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 To begin, click or say yes as your dog backs away from food in your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 Then put the food on the floor under your hand and click for your dog staying away from the food on the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 If you've never trained your dog a leave it before, you can follow the steps in these two videos on how to teach a beginning leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 Step 2. Drop a piece of low value food from a low height.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 Click or say yes as you drop the food and feed your dog a treat of higher value than the treat you're dropping on the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 What to do if your dog goes for the dropped food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 Lou was comfortable with me holding her back with the hand that I'm holding the yummy treats in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 However, if you think your dog is going to be intimidated by you touching your dog, then don't do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 Instead, you can cover the treat with your hand if your dog goes for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 Or have your dog attached with a leash and harness so your dog can't reach the treats that are dropping on the floor in the initial training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 Then when your dog is successful, you can remove the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 Step 3. Add criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Now drop the food from higher up. You can also start to drop different types of food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 If your dog is unsuccessful, you can go back a step. So you can drop higher value food from lower.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 And if your dog is really struggling, you can have someone else drop the treats while you work with your dog at a distance from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Don't cue your dog to leave it. You want this to be a default behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 So the cue for your dog to leave the food is the food dropping on the floor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 As your dog starts to master this exercise, you can click after you drop the food or click your dog as you pick the food up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 The final result will be you drop the food, you pick it up, you tell your dog he's a good boy, and then you can get him a treat from the fridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 Don't do this training exercise with any food that your dog can't eat just in case your dog does go for the food and eats it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB21cePYLP4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=384&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 The pills I dropped in the beginning of the video were actually lose vitamins.
