https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone in my last video I was going over some advanced heel work games in this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=5.9s	5.9	 I got requests for teaching the cue for the dog to target your hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 So that you can use that to teach heel work. So my boy bliss here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=16.4s	16.4	 He's actually my service dog and he knows to walk at my side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=20.7s	20.7	 but on a loose leash next to me not doing a trick heel or an obedience heel as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=27.6s	27.6	 Such and a long time ago. I did work on this behavior of him touching my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=33.2s	33.2	 I call it push which means not just a touch where you might have already trained your dog the touch cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=40.3s	40.3	 Which means to touch and back up which is useful for lots of tricks and behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 But there's also the cue to put your nose to a hand and keep it there or your nose to something else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=52.2s	52.2	 Say for example, you want your dog to push a door closed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=55.7s	55.7	 That's why actually I just started thinking about training him the cue to push
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=61.1s	61.1	 So you can either use a door with a post-it note and first get the dog to target the his nose to the door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=68.8s	68.8	 And the post-it note and then teach the dog to do a duration push until the door closes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 So that's one way you can train it. Another way is if you've already trained your dog a chin rest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Which is a duration behavior where and I'll link in the description below a video on training a chin rest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=87.2s	87.2	 But you're basically just luring your dog's head into your hand like that good and then marking for duration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=94.5s	94.5	 Keeping their chin in your hand like that good and then what you can do is morph it into a nose target
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=101.6s	101.6	 So first it starts out where the dogs like this and then you can get it to where your dog is touching your their nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 To your hand like that and then for me I like it to be underneath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=112.5s	112.5	 So they're touching their nose to this part of your hand, but he doesn't know that yet as you could see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=118.7s	118.7	 So one way of getting him to push his nose into my hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 Just his nose and not his chin. I can give him the cue chin and then I can also back up good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=129.1s	129.1	 So he's holding his chin good in my hand like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=133.1s	133.1	 So if you first follow the chin rest exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 There's also some backing up involved in that to get your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=140.6s	140.6	 Interested in putting their nose into that position and this is a great motivating game to get your dog to want to maintain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=147.7s	147.7	 a position and find it fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=150.3s	150.3	 So I'm gonna hold my hand out and say chin good and then the other hand is gonna come down and feed him treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=158.0s	158.0	 Good like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=160.2s	160.2	 Good so I'm not pulling his chin up. He's putting his hand his chin into my hand. I don't know if I'm close enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 Ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 Okay, so I can start to hold the hand higher like that good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=176.9s	176.9	 Push and I'm gonna add the new cue which is push push good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=183.5s	183.5	 Push good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=186.1s	186.1	 Push good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=189.4s	189.4	 And I'm using treats that are easy to dispense so previously I've been using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=196.7s	196.7	 Raw food that's freeze-dried as treats, but they're so hard to work on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 Giving a treat really quickly and precisely so specifically for this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=206.8s	206.8	 I would use kibble or I've cut up little bits of hot dog to the right size
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=211.8s	211.8	 So they're not any small pieces that are hard hard to give because I want this behavior to look nice and precise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=218.8s	218.8	 So I want to have a nice precise treat delivery. So it starts like this push good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=226.0s	226.0	 push
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 Good and if I say push and he doesn't do it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=230.8s	230.8	 I'm just gonna stop saying push and just hold my hand out good and then mark the moment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=236.2s	236.2	 He goes and touches my hand good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=239.3s	239.3	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=242.3s	242.3	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=244.9s	244.9	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 Push good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=250.4s	250.4	 Ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=252.1s	252.1	 Push good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=254.8s	254.8	 Push good that looks nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=257.7s	257.7	 Push good, and I haven't got him right next to my body yet. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=263.1s	263.1	 I'm just holding my hand further away so I can see what's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=267.4s	267.4	 If I had my hand here and I did the exercise he might he might start to learn to heal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=273.6s	273.6	 With his butt pointing outwards like that. So I'm just working on his the the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=280.4s	280.4	 Q of lift your head up and touch my hand as you walk and then teaching the position next to your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=287.2s	287.2	 Is a whole other behavior and I'm not going to go over it in this video, but I do have a members video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=293.7s	293.7	 If you're one of the Kiko pop members you can look it up in the member section, it's a video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=299.4s	299.4	 It's like 20 minutes on teaching heel work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=302.2s	302.2	 Another game to play if you're just getting started in heel work is teaching between like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=308.8s	308.8	 Because it's really easy to work on turns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 So he actually gave me the idea to talk about it right now, but you can work on the dog staying in the right position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=319.7s	319.7	 When you make turns like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=323.2s	323.2	 And it also builds confidence being near your you know, really close to your legs as a first start before they're then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=330.9s	330.9	 Right next to you like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=333.3s	333.3	 Good job, and we haven't worked on it yet. He still needs to learn to turn when I turn and keep his butt and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=340.8s	340.8	 His back nice and straight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=343.1s	343.1	 But to go back I get easily distracted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=346.9s	346.9	 To go back. He's doing really good with this pushing behavior like this good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=351.8s	351.8	 So then I changed it so that he was following the pushing behavior like this and my hand is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=358.4s	358.4	 Behind the other hand to give him treats like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=361.9s	361.9	 Let me get a close a close-up shot of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=365.5s	365.5	 My hand is like here this one with the treats in it good, and then I'm feeding him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=371.7s	371.7	 Touch I mean push good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=375.3s	375.3	 Push good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 Like that so that he's pushing and then the treats appear in the head position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=382.4s	382.4	 So he doesn't have to move his head or look around to get the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=385.1s	385.1	 I'm bringing the treat to him like that and then eventually this hand disappears push good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=391.1s	391.1	 And then it comes and reappears push
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=396.2s	396.2	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 So he doesn't need to look at me to get the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=400.7s	400.7	 He just needs to put his head his head there and that's gonna help with the dog looking around thinking that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=406.9s	406.9	 Their treat or their toy is gonna come from somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=409.6s	409.6	 They're just gonna look up at you and know that you're gonna deliver to the position of their head like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=416.2s	416.2	 Free and then you can practice with the dog in a sit as well. He said I'd like to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=422.7s	422.7	 good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=424.3s	424.3	 push
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=425.9s	425.9	 Good, and I like to hold my hand like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=429.8s	429.8	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=431.3s	431.3	 You can also hold it like that good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=434.2s	434.2	 Push good and it was Bridget van Gessel that really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 Implemented or or cemented is the word I'm looking for the idea that you really have to keep the dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=445.4s	445.4	 Head in the position like that when you mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=448.8s	448.8	 push
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=450.0s	450.0	 Good, and then the treat has to come right into oops not like that right into the dog's mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=457.4s	457.4	 While their head is in the position you like so you're really feeding the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=461.8s	461.8	 And then you can morph the pushing behavior if you want your dog to target your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=467.0s	467.0	 Into marking the moment your dog touches good the side of your body with their nose like that good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=476.3s	476.3	 Good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=496.8s	496.8	 If you have a short dog don't despair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=499.2s	499.2	 There are fun games to play with your short dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=502.0s	502.0	 But you're probably not going to be wanting to walk backwards while your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=506.7s	506.7	 Pushes their nose into your hand you can do that if you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=511.2s	511.2	 If your back allows it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=512.9s	512.9	 Um, my back is going to get really hurt. I think I could actually do it push
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=517.3s	517.3	 Um and get away with it, but my back's gonna hurt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=521.1s	521.1	 Or maybe you just can't do that and you might trip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=523.7s	523.7	 So one way of getting your dog to play a similar game and learn the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=529.5s	529.5	 Is simply marking the dog for looking up at you while in that position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=534.0s	534.0	 And if your dog starts to go out like swing their butt out to the side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=538.4s	538.4	 You can use a chair or a wall as a barrier, but you're just going to mark the dog's head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=544.8s	544.8	 For looking straight up like that while you're standing still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=549.6s	549.6	 Like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=550.8s	550.8	 Am I in the shot?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=552.5s	552.5	 Good or moving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=554.8s	554.8	 So you're marking that moment the dog's looking up in the way that you want the dog to look up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=560.6s	560.6	 And then you're feeding the treat and then if you want to get rid of the hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=566.4s	566.4	 So that your dog isn't staring at your hand sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=569.6s	569.6	 You can start to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=571.8s	571.8	 Mark and reinforce your dog looking at your other hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=575.4s	575.4	 Right here and then pull it away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=578.2s	578.2	 So they're looking up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=580.4s	580.4	 So it depends where you want your little dog to look up. I would have them look up here at your hip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=586.1s	586.1	 That's where I would have a little dog look because if you're standing like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=590.3s	590.3	 They're not going to be able to see your eyes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=591.8s	591.8	 So they're going to come to about here in order to be able to see your eyes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=596.6s	596.6	 Here in order to be able to see your eyeballs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=600.5s	600.5	 So I would have the dog stare here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=602.8s	602.8	 So it's a it is a sustained target just like the pushing behavior, but they're visually staring right here on your hip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=610.8s	610.8	 And that's where the treat is going to appear from the other hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=616.7s	616.7	 So you don't have to use a clicker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=618.8s	618.8	 Um, I like to use a clicker when it's not near the dog's head. So when I was doing the pushing behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=623.8s	623.8	 Um, it was too close to the dog's head good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=626.6s	626.6	 So here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=627.8s	627.8	 Did you see that he kind of backed away because he didn't know what I was doing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=631.6s	631.6	 This is a great confidence building exercise too because he thinks i'm like reaching to go pick him up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=637.6s	637.6	 good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=641.2s	641.2	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=642.8s	642.8	 Let's go good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=645.1s	645.1	 And i'm just gonna good add in a couple steps good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=648.8s	648.8	 So if your dog lags you can have the treat right there near their face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=654.1s	654.1	 Good and again good that's going to hurt your back. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=659.5s	659.5	 um
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=662.0s	662.0	 I suggest using a target stick that you can put a treat in and then you can use that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=668.8s	668.8	 To get your dog to follow a lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=671.2s	671.2	 At your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=672.8s	672.8	 Or get it you can teach your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=675.9s	675.9	 To follow the lure around you and practice the behavior of following looking up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=681.8s	681.8	 Good with duration the idea to put treats in a target stick comes from the trainer mary ray
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=687.6s	687.6	 The amazing mary ray and I have a video on how to train your dog to follow a target stick

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=697.8s	697.8	 For training a behavior like this

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ZnjUwbRQw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=52&pp=iAQB&t=719.2s	719.2	 Moving toys around throwing toys or dropping treats ready push
