https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 are new to using food to train puppies or adult dogs. Now the first one that I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=10.4s	10.4	 noticed the most is that the owner doesn't have treats that the puppy finds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 reinforcing so the puppy starts to look away in different directions and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=19.5s	19.5	 the person will move the food into the puppy's space and wave it around to try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=23.5s	23.5	 and get that puppy interested in the food or force them to eat the treat even
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=28.1s	28.1	 though they're not really that interested in it. Now if you've ever gone to a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=31.5s	31.5	 restaurant and you don't particularly like the food that you're eating having
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=34.9s	34.9	 someone take it and try to feed you with it is not going to make you like the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=39.2s	39.2	 food better so either you need to choose higher value treats that the puppy will

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 I'll link a video in the description below on games to play if your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 not interested in food. I'll also link a video in the description on games to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=59.7s	59.7	 play if your puppy or your adult dog is too excited about food. It's extremely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 important to not try to train a puppy or new dog when they're too aroused by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=70.8s	70.8	 treats that you have because what you can inadvertently do is train your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 or adult dog to be too excited and too aroused when doing the behaviors you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 trained when they've been too excited about the food. If you skip the step of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 teaching calmness around food first before training what can happen is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 you can get a puppy or an adult dog that then as they continue with their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=94.1s	94.1	 training they can start to whine and bark while they do the behaviors that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=98.3s	98.3	 you've trained when they were a little bit too excited. So I suggest first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 teaching calmness and when you work on new behaviors teach your puppy to do the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 behaviors in a calm manner first so you can work on precision of the movement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=113.1s	113.1	 and then once you get that precision then you can build speed into the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=117.9s	117.9	 behaviors that you want using fast treat deliveries or toys later. Another common
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=124.3s	124.3	 error that I see when people are using food as a lure is they put the lure too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=127.7s	127.7	 close to the dog's face so the puppy is licking and biting and pawing to try and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=132.8s	132.8	 get the food out and they're not learning the behavior that you want them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 to learn. So the first step is teaching the dog the concept of following a lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=141.7s	141.7	 without licking and biting your hand first before you try to train anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=146.2s	146.2	 else. So the way that I like to do that is luring the dog from a distance and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=150.9s	150.9	 clicking and reinforcing the dog for having a closed mouth while following
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 the treat. If the puppy jumps like that you simply don't click and then make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=162.3s	162.3	 sure to click before your puppy thinks to jump like that. Good. As your puppy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 face. Another common error that I see occurring is that people assume that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 dogs love petting as reinforcement and some dogs actually do like petting but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=180.2s	180.2	 when they're working for food they don't like petting they want the food. So what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 I see often happening is the dog will lay down the owner will give him a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 and then he'll say good boy and he'll rub the dog like this and especially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=192.4s	192.4	 with a puppy that type of petting is very arousing and it's going to interfere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 with your training so I suggest keeping your hands off your puppy while you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 training them something new and if you want to teach your puppy to enjoy being

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 dogs find that annoying and you'll see sometimes they'll try to avoid your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LxWMyAw4c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=246&pp=iAQB&t=218.7s	218.7	 So no petting when training and if you want to add petting use a behavior your
