https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey guys, today's video is a quick tutorial on how to proof a stay with the distraction of food using positive reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 You can work on this exercise with your dog in any position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 but I suggest choosing your dog's strongest position first to teach the concept of this game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=16.9s	16.9	 before working on positions that you haven't done as much training with. So for example with Halo,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=22.1s	22.1	 he's worked a lot on a down, but not on a stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=25.2s	25.2	 So first I'm going to teach him the concept of this game with the down and then the sit and then the stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=30.7s	30.7	 Ask your dog to get into the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 Halo down, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 And then hold a treat out like this further away from the dog and click as you hold the treat out for the dog staying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=44.1s	44.1	 Good job. If the dog gets up at any point, you can lure the dog back into the down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=49.2s	49.2	 Don't give him the treat, but click as you move your hand away and then give him the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=53.7s	53.7	 so the dog is learning that when your hand moves away from him, it means to stay in the position. Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=60.2s	60.2	 Once your dog is successful at you holding the treat out like this and staying down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 you can start to move your hand down to the ground with the treat in it like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=68.2s	68.2	 You might not want to go all the way down to the ground at first, so you can wave your hand up and down like this at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=76.4s	76.4	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=78.4s	78.4	 When your dog is successful with you touching the treat down to the ground before giving it to him,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 you can then place the treat down on the ground briefly before picking it up and giving it to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=89.9s	89.9	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=92.6s	92.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=98.1s	98.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=100.5s	100.5	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 If your dog is successful with this, you can move on to the next step of leaving the treat there and moving your hand away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=108.1s	108.1	 Now if the dog goes to get the treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=110.3s	110.3	 just quickly pick it up, lower your dog back into the down, move your hand away, click and treat, and then make it a little bit easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=116.6s	116.6	 so you're just putting the treat there and picking it up again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=121.7s	121.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 The next step is putting the treats down and then seeing if your dog can give you eye contact instead of staring at the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 Good job. If your dog doesn't think to look up at you, you can make a kissy noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=139.2s	139.2	 or a little blowing noise and click when your dog looks in your direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=149.3s	149.3	 It's very tempting, I know. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=157.3s	157.3	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 Halo free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Then you want to make sure to release your dog from the stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 click and treat your dog for getting up. Some dogs after you've worked on a lot of distractions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=169.1s	169.1	 they'll be reluctant to get up when you ask them to, but it's really important to keep the release cue very strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 so that they understand that they're only getting up on the release cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 And so when you release your dog up, halo free, you want to make sure that the dog gets up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=184.6s	184.6	 So you might want to back up and pat your legs to get that dog to get up within two to three seconds of you saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 the release cue and his is the cue free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 Now I'm going to play the same game while I'm standing up, but because the picture has changed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=207.3s	207.3	 I'm going to go back a step and go back to asking the dog to down and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=212.5s	212.5	 then holding the treat out like this. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=216.1s	216.1	 And then putting it down on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=226.1s	226.1	 And then dropping it. Good job. And now I'm going to try standing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=232.1s	232.1	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=247.1s	247.1	 First you click as you throw the treat and then when your dog gets better, you can throw multiple treats before clicking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 That one was hard because it looked like it was going to go right for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=259.1s	259.1	 I don't suggest with this game that you put the treat down and then tell your dog, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=264.1s	264.1	 Because what can happen is the dog can start to anticipate that the treat being down on the floor is going to predict
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=272.1s	272.1	 that you're going to cue him to get it and then you can cause a little bit of frustration and anxiety if your dog is in an environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=279.1s	279.1	 where he thinks he's going to be released to something and it's just not going to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=284.1s	284.1	 So I suggest with this game when the distractions happen that you then bring whatever it is to the dog or you reinforce with what you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=292.1s	292.1	 rather than it always being a release to whatever it is in the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=297.1s	297.1	 I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. See you later guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gntre-zyg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=238&pp=iAQB&t=299.1s	299.1	 Can you both pause? Good job guys. Good job.
