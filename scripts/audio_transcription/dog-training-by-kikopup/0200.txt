https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=530.0s	530.0	 carrying you around in the street and someone with an umbrella passes by you're

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=541.0s	541.0	 old your mom's going to ask you hey do you remember when you saw that umbrella
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=545.0s	545.0	 when you were eight weeks old in my arms and as a little baby as a little kid

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=572.0s	572.0	 meaningful so in order to teach puppies to make memories of different objects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=579.0s	579.0	 and strange the way people look and the way objects look that are strange to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=586.0s	586.0	 make them memorable and positive we can use training games and really draw

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=679.0s	679.0	 the house and those training techniques in that video which I'll link in the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=693.0s	693.0	 difference is that you might expand the different the different types of noises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=698.0s	698.0	 that the puppy is hearing and in this modern world it becomes very easy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzJgEmRlTM8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=201&pp=iAQB&t=709.0s	709.0	 two different categories of noises that I like to think about and one is
