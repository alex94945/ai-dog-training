I was working with Tug and throwing treats into the grass. I don't know if he got all the crumbs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUD3SgM-feQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 Release the dog into the safe area that has the distractions. Then, recall your dog. Click and reinforce your dog for coming. Then send your dog to go and get to do what they wanted to do.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUD3SgM-feQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 This might actually take a couple of minutes if your dog is very interested in the sniffing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUD3SgM-feQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=467&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 Here you can see the result that you're looking for, a dog that's more interested in working for you than sniffing around in the grass. I taught Kiko that the most reinforcing thing in this situation is me and the reinforcement I have rather than the environment.
