https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 Teaching your puppy an attention noise first will greatly help with this exercise.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 Have one or more family members or friends sit apart from each other and take turns calling the puppy back and forth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 First, you're going to entice your puppy to run towards you, click the moment your puppy is running the fastest, and feed in front of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 Feed random treats for the puppy staying with you before the other person starts to call the puppy back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 If you only give your puppy one treat for coming to you in this game, your puppy could soon learn to just run back and forth getting treats from people and not learn the exercise of coming when called and staying with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 You can add your cue when your puppy is reliably running to you. If your puppy stops coming to you, go back a step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 Make sure to feed your puppy when all four of her feet are on the floor and not on you to not reinforce jumping.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 By doing this, you can condition what looks like a reflexive behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 Watch this footage of the puppy's reaction to hearing the cue, come, after it being paired with food only just a couple of times in this first training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 Problem solving. Try different treats. We are using boiled chicken, a tasty and healthy treat for young puppies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726K56xzKJY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=412&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 Try a less distracting location. Use a long line attached to a harness for safety. Never attach to a collar. It could cause severe neck injuries.
