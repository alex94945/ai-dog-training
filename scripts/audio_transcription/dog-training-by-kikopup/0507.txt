https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 as a default whenever you sit down and they're on leash

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 And when they choose to lay down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 which Splash has already done this exercise before

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 when they choose to lay down on their own,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 then just ignore them, wait for them to lay back down again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 You don't see the dog, what dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 And then when they're down again, treats rain from the sky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 And if they stay down like that, they get more treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 And then gradually the treat rate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 however many times you're dropping the treats, gets longer and longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 So they have to be laying there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 calmly settled for longer and longer periods of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 The next thing you want to add is some handling and distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 So, once they've mastered settling at your feet in the living room,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 then try other rooms in the house, try the garden,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 go in the street, go to, you know, the final thing would be a cafe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 So, you can also add some handling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=191.0s	191.0	 So if they stay down while you're handling them, yep, they get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 And handling, maybe tail pulling, maybe a little kid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 this is for the little kid that comes up at the restaurant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 and kind of comes and puts it on his face,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 and they get reinforced for staying there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 So I'm not telling her to stay there, she likes to stay there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 She's been reinforced for it, so it's a behavior that she chooses on her own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 Will she stay there while I walk away?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 That's a behavior to be reinforced.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=222.0s	222.0	 She's tapping for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 Come, Kiko.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 I'm going to do some tricks with Kiko.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=245.0s	245.0	 I'm just going to ignore her and only reinforce her when she lays down again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 Kiko, come here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 and have one of the dogs settle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 I would give a treat for every time the other dog gets a treat at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 So they learn I'm getting just as many treats just laying here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=272.0s	272.0	 as that dog is doing their behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 And how wonderful of an honor is that to do that for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 Okay, all done.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 all he can focus on is how he can get that food.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 So when the dog doesn't get his food that he's expecting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=334.0s	334.0	 he gets frustrated and gets up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR7TvrUQ_1k&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=508&pp=iAQB&t=377.0s	377.0	 Use high value treats like real meat or cheese for such a wonderful behavior.
