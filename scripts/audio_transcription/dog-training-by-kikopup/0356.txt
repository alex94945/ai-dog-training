https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 The leash was constantly tight and she was running around in circles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 So the first step before hitting the street was to work in an environment where she was able to take food and be successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 So here I am clicking her for catching up to me and feeding her at my side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 As she's eating I'm walking off to give myself time to be ahead of her before she catches up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 When she does go past me I simply back up or turn around until she's next to me again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 Here you can see Bella tries to cross behind me but instead of jerking her I just create less leash so she can't get to the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 Her reward for walking on a loose leash is to get to sniff the bushes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 I let her sniff for a while and then I tell her let's go and click and treat her for coming with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 The moment I clicked is when she chose to come with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Here's footage of Lucas a basset hound playing the same game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 I'm clicking him for catching up to me and treating him at my side as he gets there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Now that we're outside Bella is too excited to take treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 So the method that I'm using is if she pulls I'm simply going to back up and then move forwards again when the leash is loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 Even though she's not that interested in the food I'm still going to offer her food when she's doing the correct behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 Here she's taking it but most of the walk she was not taking the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 Because Bella and I had just worked on leash walking in an environment where she could concentrate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 we're having way more success on the first walk outside where she can't take food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 When she does pull I'm simply just going to stop, walk backwards until she willingly wants to come with me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 and then when the leash is loose we're going to walk forwards again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 You can encourage your dog back with your voice and patting your leg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 Without prior training on a walk when a person stops the dog will usually walk towards the end of the leash and start pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 So to teach the dog to stop when you stop, walk forwards a step, click as the dog gets to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 and click and feed again for the dog staying with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 Then take another step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 As long as the leash is loose it is perfectly appropriate to let the dog sniff around as you're walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 However if they are to pull you can back away from what they're sniffing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 and then when the leash is loose again start walking forwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 A walk should be about fulfilling a dog's needs as well as a human's needs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 Dogs need not only physical exercise but also mental stimulation as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt_B-JwItMs&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=357&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 and sniffing fulfills a big part of that.
