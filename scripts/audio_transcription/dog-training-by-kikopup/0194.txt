https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, this video is on the topic of teaching your puppy what to do when he feels pressure on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 Either when he's run out and hit the end of the leash or when you've had to add pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 Say for example your puppy runs into the road and you need to move your puppy out of the road using leash pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=19.6s	19.6	 Now of course you can pick your puppy up in emergencies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 but if you have a puppy that's going to turn into a larger adult dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=27.9s	27.9	 at some point in his life you're going to need to have to move your puppy with the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 Now without any prior training most puppies and dogs when you pull on their leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 they one, find it aversive and two, usually lean the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 The same with human beings. If you had a harness tied around your chest with a leash coming out of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=50.3s	50.3	 and someone pulled on it, you naturally would counterbalance by leaning backwards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=56.3s	56.3	 rather than just following whoever pulls you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=59.2s	59.2	 So basically in this exercise we're teaching puppies that when they feel the pressure on the leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=65.7s	65.7	 it's simply a cue saying come with me we're moving in a different direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=71.1s	71.1	 And by creating a positive association with the feeling of pressure on the leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 it simply becomes a cue for the dog to want to move with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 Now if you work on this exercise with a young puppy right from the beginning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=84.7s	84.7	 before the puppy starts pulling a lot on the leash when you're out and about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 it actually can teach your puppy to walk on a loose leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=92.5s	92.5	 This is because if you work on the exercise enough, your dog is going to have a conditioned response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 where they feel the pressure on the leash and it will cue them to come back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 Here are some exercises you should work on first before playing the leash pressure game with your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=108.1s	108.1	 This is because you want to reinforce your puppy for moving towards you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=112.3s	112.3	 moving with you, and moving with you when you make direction changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=116.9s	116.9	 And once you've reinforced all of these behaviors, it will make it way easier for the puppy to want to choose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=122.7s	122.7	 to move with you when you add the leash pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=126.4s	126.4	 In my opinion, the four exercises that you want to work on first are the attention game, the recall,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 reinforcing your puppy for standing next to you and walking next to you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=138.1s	138.1	 and reinforcing your puppy for direction changes while walking at your side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=144.3s	144.3	 Check out the written description below for links to video tutorials on how to train these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=150.7s	150.7	 This is footage of one of our first outings to the park. After letting my puppy explore and sniff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 the park, I spent one to two minutes playing the attention game, reinforcing the position at my side,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=163.6s	163.6	 and direction changes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=168.4s	168.4	 The leash pressure game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=172.3s	172.3	 Step one, add light pressure on the leash as you lower your puppy forward and then feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=180.3s	180.3	 The point of this step is to accustom the puppy to the sensation of the leash pressure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=185.4s	185.4	 so it's not a sudden surprise. I suggest attaching the leash to your dog's harness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 when you play games like this as well as walk your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=194.7s	194.7	 If you're going to be walking your dog with the leash attached to the front of your dog's harness,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=198.7s	198.7	 you need to work on this exercise with the leash attached to the front as well as the back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=203.4s	203.4	 Keep an eye on your puppy's tail and make sure it's in a natural position and the puppy is not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=208.3s	208.3	 tucking their tail. If the puppy starts to tuck the tail, you can work on games like the attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=213.9s	213.9	 game, the recall, as well as handling exercises rather than working on the leash pressure game yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=220.3s	220.3	 Step two, put a distraction down on the ground that makes the puppy pull on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=225.6s	225.6	 Use your attention noise or a treat lure to get your puppy to turn around and come back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=250.3s	250.3	 What to do if your puppy doesn't turn around? One, practice from further away from the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=256.2s	256.2	 You can have a helper put down the distraction to make this easier. Two, use a lower value treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=263.1s	263.1	 as the distraction and a higher value treat as the reinforcer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 Step three, put a distraction down on the ground that makes the puppy pull on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 When the puppy is on a tight leash, move in the opposite direction of the puppy without jerking him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=280.7s	280.7	 Mark and reinforce when you see your puppy turn in your direction. If the puppy doesn't turn toward
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=286.6s	286.6	 you within two seconds, use your attention noise or treat lure to get your puppy to turn around and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 come back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=295.6s	295.6	 Mark the moment the puppy turns towards you and feed the puppy the treat as close to your body as you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=301.6s	301.6	 to train the puppy to come all the way to you. Mark and reinforce when you see your puppy turn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 around and come back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=311.6s	311.6	 If the puppy doesn't turn around, use your attention noise or treat lure to get your puppy to turn around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=317.6s	317.6	 and come back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=325.6s	325.6	 Mark and reinforce multiple times for the puppy being at your side or being in front of you before you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=331.6s	331.6	 repeat the exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=333.6s	333.6	 If your puppy sits or lays down, simply revert back to using the treat lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=339.6s	339.6	 So she went out, she felt the leash pressure, and that made her want to come back and not be on a tight leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 Basically, you're teaching the dog when they feel a tight leash, they should come near you to loosen the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=353.6s	353.6	 Now if you keep proofing this game, your dog is going to generalize it so you can use different types of food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=359.6s	359.6	 different types of toys, different types of people and dogs, places to sniff, like a fire hydrant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=367.6s	367.6	 You're going to teach your dog when they see things they want, the only way to get there is on a loose leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=376.6s	376.6	 So I'm going to remove the distraction over here and do the game again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=384.6s	384.6	 So pressure on the leash, click and feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=386.6s	386.6	 What you're not doing is jerking your dog, you're holding the leash against your body to move your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=393.6s	393.6	 Good job! And be careful that you don't back up and trip on something because that happens to me a lot, especially in public.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=400.6s	400.6	 Step 4. Practice with different distractions in different situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=406.6s	406.6	 I suggest playing this game for 1-2 minutes, 10-12 times in the first few weeks that you own your new puppy or dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=416.6s	416.6	 This is Martina's Bordicale Lumos at 6 months and you can see he has a positive emotional response when he feels the pressure on the leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=424.6s	424.6	 and he knows what to do when he feels the pressure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=429.6s	429.6	 If you notice your dog starts to pull again, it's a great idea to go back and do brush up training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=440.6s	440.6	 Here's an example of working on the leash pressure game with a high level distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=444.6s	444.6	 If something is too much for your dog, you'll notice that they won't be able to turn away from the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=450.6s	450.6	 So if this happens, you need to make the distraction less exciting or move further away from the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=459.6s	459.6	 If you're doing this exercise correctly, you'll find that your puppy will stop pulling altogether.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=470.6s	470.6	 This is a good thing. If he keeps trying to go for the distraction, it means the distraction is too difficult, too close,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=477.6s	477.6	 or you need to spend more time marking and reinforcing him for staying with you after he comes back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=485.6s	485.6	 In real life situations, if your puppy starts pulling on leash, you can simply back up until he is on a loose leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=492.6s	492.6	 then wait a bit until you have made a connection with him again before walking forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Z3SFT8U0g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=195&pp=iAQB&t=498.6s	498.6	 I hope you enjoyed watching Halo as a tiny puppy and I hope you found this video helpful for your training.
