https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Teach your dog to come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 Part 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 I'm first going to warm him up and get the behavior that I want, which is him running to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 So I'm just going to back up and as he comes towards me I'm going to click and feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 And we went over this last time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 And then when I get the behavior I want reliably I can start adding the cue here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 So I'm going to say, bear, here!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 And click him for coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 Bear, here! Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 Bear, here!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 And I don't have to feed on the ground, but it's a good way of getting to be faster than your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Because if we feed them in their mouth they can catch up to you really fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 Now this is the hard part that we add.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 It's the distraction. It's calling them away from something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 Like for example if it was a dead rat or something, you want to be able to call them away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 So I'm going to put the treats down there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 And then I'm going to say, bear, here!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 Now if he didn't come with me I could walk backwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 Bear, here!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 And now I'm going to click him for staying with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 So he's not just darting back to the thing that he wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 He's genuinely staying with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 If it was another dog over there and I want to release him to go play again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 maybe it's Bella that I'm calling him away from,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 I'm going to say, okay, go say hi or okay, go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 And then he can eat the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 So it's not really a leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 It depends how you want to play the exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 They could never get it or they could get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 Maybe it's his ball, maybe it's a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 Bear, here!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 Awesome! And then try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 I mean, basically by repetition it becomes easier for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Bear, here!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 Awesome!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 Step 1. Back up and click your dog for running to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 Step 2. Add a cue like here or come and click as the dog is in motion and feed for the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 Step 3. Once your dog is reliably coming without distraction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=138.0s	138.0	 add distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 With the dog in a harness on leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 put a piece of food, a ball or some other type of distraction down out of reach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 Call your dog away from it and click your dog the moment he thinks to turn in your direction at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 Next, you can click the dog as he turns and runs towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 Add different types of distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 Problem Solving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 If the dog does not turn away from the distraction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=163.0s	163.0	 back up so the dog is further away and try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 Do not jerk the dog away as this will not be teaching the dog to want to come to you off leash when there are distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 We want to click the dog's choice to choose us over the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=340l3fx_B7Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 A big thanks to Bear, the 4 month old German Shepherd puppy, for helping us with this video.
