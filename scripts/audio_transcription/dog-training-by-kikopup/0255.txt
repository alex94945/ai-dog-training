https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everyone, today I'm going to be talking about how to interrupt undesirable behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 without having to use physical or psychological intimidation to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 A lot of people have the misconception that if you're using positive reinforcement to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=13.5s	13.5	 train your dog that you're supposed to ignore unwanted behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=17.7s	17.7	 This is simply not true and also a really bad idea because most of the behaviors that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 we find undesirable in dogs are usually self-reinforcing or in other words the dogs enjoy doing them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=29.9s	29.9	 For example chewing on your furniture or barking when they see a dog passing in the street.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=35.3s	35.3	 If you just ignore these behaviors they're going to gather a reinforcement history and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=39.6s	39.6	 they're going to be really hard to get rid of in the future because your dog has been
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=42.9s	42.9	 rehearsing them for a long period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=46.5s	46.5	 So in my training and I suggest in your training it's really important if you see a behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=51.7s	51.7	 you don't like you need to either figure out a way to prevent that behavior by managing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=56.8s	56.8	 the environment as you train your dog appropriate behaviors or you need to interrupt that behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=62.6s	62.6	 as soon as you see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=63.7s	63.7	 So if you see your puppy going to chew on your furniture you can interrupt your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=68.7s	68.7	 but a lot of people believe that you have to use punishment to interrupt undesirable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=73.7s	73.7	 behavior but this is really not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=75.9s	75.9	 I've been training dogs with this method for over 15 years and I've never seen any issues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=81.2s	81.2	 arise from this method and I actually believe it's a better way of training that's why I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=86.6s	86.6	 use it because what happens is you don't get any of the side effects that are associated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=91.6s	91.6	 with punishment and that is why I use this method.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=94.7s	94.7	 I don't believe that it's cruel or inhumane to tell your puppy or your adult dog that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 you've just rescued no or eh-eh when they do certain behaviors you dislike but I really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 believe that by using a interrupter that you've trained like a cue that tells your dog what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=110.7s	110.7	 to do is a much better way of training because you don't get the baggage of punishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=116.4s	116.4	 Here is a list of the different ways that you can interrupt your dog without using physical
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=120.9s	120.9	 or psychological intimidation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 An attention noise, recall, leave it, stationing behavior, drop it, let's go, an alternate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=131.4s	131.4	 behavior, treat lore, release cue or move the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=138.4s	138.4	 First you need to set up training sessions to train your dog these behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 You might only need one or two depending on your situation but once you've trained your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=147.2s	147.2	 dog the behavior you then need to proof the behavior in proofing sessions which simply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 means asking for the behavior in different scenarios and different environments to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 sure the dog understands that no matter what situation the same behavior is required.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=162.3s	162.3	 I have videos on how to train I believe all of these different ways to interrupt behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=167.2s	167.2	 in the description below and it also gives examples of proofing the behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 Now I'm going to talk about all those different behaviors on the list starting with the attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=175.5s	175.5	 noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=176.5s	176.5	 I think this is the easiest and the quickest interrupter to train so I'll use it with new
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 clients and new trainers and new rescue dogs and puppies who haven't had any prior training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=186.3s	186.3	 because it's quick and easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 Now all you have to do is make a kissy noise and when your dog looks up at you you mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=193.4s	193.4	 and reinforce your dog for looking at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=195.7s	195.7	 Once you've trained and proofed that behavior then if your dog is doing something that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 don't really like you can make the kissy noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=202.3s	202.3	 Your dog looks at you to say what and then you can tell your dog what you do want them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=206.3s	206.3	 to do and if they don't know any cues yet you can show your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=210.0s	210.0	 So say if your puppy is chewing on the wall you can make the kissy noise and then show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=214.5s	214.5	 them their ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=216.1s	216.1	 Now it's really important when you're interrupting behavior that you understand that it's not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=222.3s	222.3	 the behavior that is important in creating a well mannered dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=226.8s	226.8	 The really important thing is training your dog what you do want them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 So puppies chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=232.7s	232.7	 So if you are simply just trying to punish them for chewing your furniture they're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 to keep wanting to chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=239.2s	239.2	 So the best solution is training them what to chew on which is their dog toys, their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=245.1s	245.1	 bones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=246.1s	246.1	 So in this video I'm talking about interrupting behavior but if the only training that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=252.1s	252.1	 do with your dog is interrupting them then that's the only time that you're giving them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 attention.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=262.1s	262.1	 touch things and ignore your dog all the other times your dog is going to start to want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 do undesirable behavior to get your attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=269.9s	269.9	 So with this training it's extremely important to reinforce the behaviors you do want your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=274.9s	274.9	 dog to do like relaxing calmly when you're ignoring your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=279.6s	279.6	 Okay so that's number one the attention noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=282.5s	282.5	 The second one is a recall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=284.1s	284.1	 Say your dog is at a distance and you need your dog to move away from something you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=288.3s	288.3	 teach them to come to you when you call them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=291.1s	291.1	 The third one that I like to use is the leave it cue and a lot of people ask me what's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 difference between a kissy noise, an attention noise, a recall and a leave it cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=301.4s	301.4	 For me I like to train the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=303.9s	303.9	 Leave it means don't bother that specific thing but you can do anything you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=309.5s	309.5	 So for example I'll show you a video of my chihuahua.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWyBr-iimnY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=256&pp=iAQB&t=313.4s	313.4	 As you can see she's a little bit too interested in the chicken so I'm going to tell her to
