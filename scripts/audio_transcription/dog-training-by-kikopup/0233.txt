https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 undesirable behavior in dogs or in other words showing dogs behaving badly before you show them after training when they're behaving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 perfectly. Now I get a lot of requests from people in comments and emails saying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=18.5s	18.5	 can you please show the dogs behaving badly because in your videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=22.9s	22.9	 you only show the dog looking perfect as they go from step to step and I have to tell these people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 oh, I'm very sorry. I can't show the dog behaving badly because what happens when you let a dog rehearse undesirable behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 is that every time a dog rehearses a behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=40.8s	40.8	 it makes it more likely to happen in the future and if you make the dog do the thing that is undesirable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=47.1s	47.1	 first before then training the dog you're actually setting the dog up to not be as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 successful in the training if they've already rehearsed the behavior, especially if they've gotten extremely over aroused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 Now a lot of people who do film production
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 they will film the dog a few days before so that the dog isn't then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=65.6s	65.6	 over aroused or over threshold when they're then doing the training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=69.4s	69.4	 but I suggest that it is not in the dog's best interest to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=74.6s	74.6	 film this in order to get more views for the TV show or the YouTube channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=81.2s	81.2	 and I know that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=83.5s	83.5	 one of the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=91.5s	91.5	 but in my opinion, I'm putting the dogs first over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=96.9s	96.9	 changing people's minds so I'm not going to show the dogs behaving badly in any of my videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=103.3s	103.3	 sadly we do live in a world where people are more likely to click on a video of a little girl getting attacked by a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=116.2s	116.2	 stay the appropriate distance from wild animals

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=124.8s	124.8	 but it's just not in the best interest of the dog another reason that it's not a good idea to show a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 behaving badly is a dog behaving badly tells you nothing about the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=159.5s	159.5	 Aggressive dog or a stubborn dog. It really doesn't help anyone besides
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=166.6s	166.6	 Perhaps getting more views to the material and getting people to look at the training method

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT7-CHam2HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=234&pp=iAQB&t=177.6s	177.6	 I'm going to demonstrate how easy it is to make a dog look bad now. This is splash
