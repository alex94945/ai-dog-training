https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone in this video, I'm going to talk about my filming setup now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=4.4s	4.4	 I'm not a specific expert on filming YouTube videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 But the members have asked and so I'm going to show you what I do now for my in my personal opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 It's not about an expensive camera nowadays an iPhone is going to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=19.5s	19.5	 Just amazingly to film and also the sound is pretty good. So the most important thing I think is lighting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=28.4s	28.4	 The the more lights you have nice white lights
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=32.6s	32.6	 The the better the video is going to look if you're filming in a dark room with a an amazing camera
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 It's not going to look as good as someone filming with a not so expensive camera
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=43.7s	43.7	 In in a wonderfully lit room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=46.7s	46.7	 Lighting also isn't expensive. You can use natural light from outside from a big window
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=53.1s	53.1	 or a glass door another thing you can do is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=57.7s	57.7	 If it's a sunny day, you can put a curtain a sheet just hang a sheet over the window so that the Sun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 doesn't make that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=67.7s	67.7	 Spot of sunlight it defuses the light so you can try that out or simply film on a cloudy day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=75.1s	75.1	 Here in San Diego
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=76.9s	76.9	 It's cloudy in the morning because the ocean is nearby. So that's a great time to film
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=82.4s	82.4	 I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=83.3s	83.3	 Have the camera that's filming and I'm going to show you that in a second, which is just a Canon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 But I actually think that even though I spent a lot of money on that camera that my iPhone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=95.8s	95.8	 Takes better quality video in different cases than the actual that that camera and then I also have a Canon D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=104.5s	104.5	 70 that I film with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=106.7s	106.7	 But I wish it was a Canon D 80
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=109.2s	109.2	 It's just that I got it before the D the D 80 came out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 The reason that I don't use this for for making my videos is I don't like other people filming me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=120.2s	120.2	 Because I have a little bit of a stutter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=122.1s	122.1	 So I like to film myself alone and then if I stutter I can edit it out and it stresses me out have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 Wasting someone's time filming me if I'm gonna then stutter and have to redo the take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=133.7s	133.7	 So with this Canon D 70 the problem that happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=139.3s	139.3	 Sometimes the camera will focus on something. I don't want it to focus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=142.9s	142.9	 So I'll be talking and I want me in focus or the dog in focus and then the camera will focus on a tree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 That's blowing in the wind or or something else like a piece of carpet or something like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 And it can ruin the whole take so for filming alone. I really suggest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=160.5s	160.5	 this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 using an iPhone which stays in focus the whole time or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=165.3s	165.3	 Some other camera like the the Canon that I have which is wonderful at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 You can set it to auto track and it's not gonna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 It's not gonna change and suddenly jump onto pieces of grass or you can just have everything in focus like it is right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=183.7s	183.7	 Here's what my filming setup looks like. I like to have an audience as well behind the camera and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 Here is the Canon XA 11 with the Rode wireless mic attached to the top and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 In the background soft light boxes. I also have the transmitter on me and the mic on my shirt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=202.6s	202.6	 I find the soft box lighting is easy on the eyes for the dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=206.9s	206.9	 I suggest getting the soft box with five lights inside instead of one where the lighting isn't very much at all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=214.9s	214.9	 This is what it looks like with just the indoor lighting and the daylight lights on the roof
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=220.3s	220.3	 And now I'm gonna put on my studio lights now the studio lights are on and you can see it creates a lot more detail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=226.7s	226.7	 In the image, so it's not so much about buying expensive lighting but about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 using lots of light and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=236.2s	236.2	 Also, if you're a little embarrassed about how you look for example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=240.3s	240.3	 Maybe you have wrinkles or you just don't like the shape of something on your face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 I really suggest lighting from both angles and from above so it kind of washes out your face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=251.7s	251.7	 so I am you know in the beginning of my 40s and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=256.4s	256.4	 Sometimes overhead lighting can make me look where I don't want to look at the footage of myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=262.3s	262.3	 So this really helps to make it more of a neutral image for myself to edit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=268.7s	268.7	 So and and also when you put yourself out in public
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 being lit from all sides without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=275.3s	275.3	 Dramatic lighting I find it makes me feel more confident. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=280.0s	280.0	 That's why I like to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 Use so much light now if you don't have studio lighting you can simply use a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=288.7s	288.7	 large window or a glass sliding door or just open a door and put a baby gate so your dog doesn't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=295.8s	295.8	 Leave the area and then be near that nice source of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=300.9s	300.9	 White light if it's a cloudy day a bright cloudy day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 That's going to be a beautiful nice white light
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 If the Sun is shining through and you don't have curtains you can always just hang a white sheet over the window
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=314.2s	314.2	 I've done that before in my living room because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=317.9s	317.9	 before I was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=319.4s	319.4	 You know trying to film on a day where there was Sun and cloud and every once in a while the Sunbeam would come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 In and mess with my footage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=328.1s	328.1	 So that's what I like to do as I said, I'm not an expert in filming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=332.9s	332.9	 But I suggest experimenting with different lighting and different camera angles to see what works best for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=339.8s	339.8	 And what you feel most confident with if you're filming yourself talking now when I first started YouTube videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=346.7s	346.7	 I tried not to be in the video so I would talk and show the dogs and then write text and I found that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=355.1s	355.1	 People want to see you so they want you to be looking straight at them telling them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 Friendly making a connection a social connection and having a conversation with people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=367.2s	367.2	 So that's something I really struggled with but when I started doing it I got used to it and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=374.3s	374.3	 It really helps to be able to listen to somebody when they're actually talking to you rather than having to hear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 just a voiceover over footage, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=385.6s	385.6	 Being personable I think really helps and genuinely personable not just pretending to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 personable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=394.4s	394.4	 also over the years I have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=397.1s	397.1	 Learned from other people how to make the background look nicer, so you don't want stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=401.8s	401.8	 That's going to distract from what you're doing. Maybe you want to have dog related stuff in the background
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=408.7s	408.7	 But I've had some friends of mine help me out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=412.9s	412.9	 My ex-wife was really good at decorating the background and my friend Joanna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=417.6s	417.6	 She introduced me to these wonderful plants that always look great. I first tried live plants and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=424.7s	424.7	 And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=425.9s	425.9	 Within a few weeks they were shriveled and dead and they never looked as luscious as these fake plants so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=433.1s	433.1	 Get a fake plant put it in the background and it can make your videos look much nicer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=438.6s	438.6	 Because I have very small dogs. I like to film from the ground using my iPhone 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=443.7s	443.7	 So I'll take a little object or I'll place the phone against the chair if you were doing a video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=450.3s	450.3	 Video that you want it to be long you have the phone like that and if you if you're doing the video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=456.1s	456.1	 from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=457.5s	457.5	 Wide angle then you're gonna have the phone like this obviously so I would set up that view
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=463.1s	463.1	 Like that and then just press record and I'm gonna put an example of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=469.6s	469.6	 What the video footage is going to look like from that same angle so first I'm going to do some stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=476.4s	476.4	 I'll set up the camera, and then I'm gonna do some stuff with epic and you can see the see the difference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=482.4s	482.4	 Now I'm filming with both cameras, and I'll show you examples of both, but you can see that the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=489.2s	489.2	 Looks much nicer from the side then from above because you can see what the legs are doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=496.4s	496.4	 Epic can you wave?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssAN_1IWbEU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=109&pp=iAQB&t=497.8s	497.8	 Another tip for filming that I often don't do because it takes time and effort if you're filming yourself is to zoom in and
