https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 A lot of people want to use my tutorial videos, but they don't want to use a clicker, or for some reason they can't use a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 So basically this tutorial shows you how you can use all my tutorial videos, but use a marker word instead of the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 All you have to do is look at my video and anytime that I'm clicking, you can basically use a verbal marker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 A good marker word to use is something short and sharp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 If you can make a noise with your mouth, like a click noise, it's better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=27.5s	27.5	 But short and sharp words like yes or yep will work perfectly well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=31.5s	31.5	 Words to avoid are words that you'll say every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=34.5s	34.5	 For example, good. If you say good boy all the time, you don't want your dog to think that good means they're going to get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=41.5s	41.5	 Your marker word should always mean that the dog is getting a treat, and then when you move on to not using treat every time for the behavior, you can start using a different word.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 So if your marker word is yes, you're going to change later on to saying good boy, and yes always means a treat, and good boy maybe means the dog will get a treat or won't get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 Use your marker word yes or yep for teaching new behaviors and raising criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=67.5s	67.5	 Use other markers, good boy, good job, yay, woohoo, etc. when your dog already understands the behavior and does not get a treat every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 As you can see me demoing here with the Portuguese Pedenko Lu, you charge the marker word in the same way that you charge the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 Say your marker word, pause, and then move to feed your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 If your dog doesn't look for the treat after 10 to 20 times, it could mean that your treat isn't good enough or the environment is too distracting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 Now you can start training new behaviors with the marker word you've conditioned, and once your dog knows the new behaviors, you can start making criteria harder, so you ask for more behaviors per treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7eRPlJ4CiU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 See you next time YouTube, and don't forget to subscribe for more free dog training tutorials on not only beginner topics, but also really advanced ones.
