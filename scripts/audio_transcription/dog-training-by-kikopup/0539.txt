https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kt_pi1z1sA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=56.7s	56.7	 I can take eye contact, yes, reinforce on the barrel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kt_pi1z1sA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=61.7s	61.7	 Dog is going to go to where the reinforcement happens and then I'm going to pump her full

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kt_pi1z1sA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 So I'm going to yes, toss a cookie over there for eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kt_pi1z1sA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=140.5s	140.5	 I'm going to call the stall and I'm going to hold her here with the cookie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kt_pi1z1sA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=540&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 When I can guarantee she's going to come up, I will put a cue on it.
