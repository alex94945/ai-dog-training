https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone! I've been meaning to make this video and I just couldn't bring myself to do it because I didn't want to cry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 So I'm out on a walk with my dogs and it's a nice cool day so I have my other dogs in the car and I do my usual routine of rotating the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 And everyone's having a wonderful walk because it's nice and cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 And so I thought now would be a great time to make this video when we're having a great time out and about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 But I just wanted to let you guys know that my dog Splash is gone now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 She was 14 and she had bladder cancer and with radiation treatment we were able to extend her life a little longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 So I had a long time to get prepared for her not being around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 So I'm very grateful for those each day extra that we had together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 And so I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm not going to make any video where she's doing amazing tricks and showing off and all that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 She was just such an amazing dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 Just the best teacher in the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=73.0s	73.0	 And she really taught me so much and how to be...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 I mean every dog that I meet is a great teacher including you and you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 But Splash really helped me start out my career in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Kiko, my little Chihuahua who's 16 now and still doing good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 Her and Splash really started out my career in dog training and taught me so much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 And also I wanted to let you guys know that Wish is actually related to Splash even though they're completely different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 I had really hoped to get a dog just like Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 So I searched and searched to find a dog and Wish is actually related.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 So I have her still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 Oh, I'm sorry, Halo, I didn't mention you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 But the dog that is the most like Splash is my little pup Bliss who's five months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 So every dog is unique and special.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 Wish is amazing at tricks but she can be super anxious and fearful of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 And Halo is just so soft and gentle and sweet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 But I just feel comforted by all their different personalities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 And there'll never be another Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 I mean, I never, when I got Wish I shouldn't have thought like, oh, I need to get a dog exactly like her so that when she's gone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 I'll have that piece of her left behind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 But I think actually it's more special to have a completely different personality and love them for who they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 So, yeah, well, Splash is gone and we're going to continue enjoying our walk after this little settle in the park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 And I will be making YouTube videos again shortly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 I'm sorry, the background keeps changing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 I hope you're all having a happy holidays and staying safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 We're doing really well here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 Everyone's healthy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 Tug just got some lumps removed and a loose tooth removed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 So he's in recovery from that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 And we'll continue our walk shortly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 This video has gone on a little long, so I will end it here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 But I just wanted to let you guys know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 And see you later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 Watch out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KniVq1tPOVM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=119&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 What did you find?
