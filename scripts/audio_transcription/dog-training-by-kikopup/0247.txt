https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=5.1s	5.1	 of your puppy in the first few weeks that you bring your puppy home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=8.9s	8.9	 Now the first one I think is the most important is not tying your shoes in front of your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 the first few days that you have your puppy or dressing and undressing yourself in front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 of your puppy because you're setting yourself up for a failure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 The puppy most likely will become very excited and want to grab at your clothes and it will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=29.6s	29.6	 begin a very bad habit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 So instead of doing that you can either put the puppy away or give the puppy a high value
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=37.3s	37.3	 chew if they have to be in the same room as you while you're tying your shoes or you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 train your puppy so someone else is tying their shoes and you can be feeding your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 treats for simply watching without thinking to grab and start tugging on the shoelaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 Another really important thing to keep in mind is that if you have your puppy outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=57.3s	57.3	 you might be thinking that you might want to do a little bit of gardening and that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=60.9s	60.9	 the worst idea to do in front of a puppy because they oftentimes will copy our behavior that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=66.8s	66.8	 we're doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=67.8s	67.8	 So if you start pulling out weeds and digging your puppy is going to start digging and also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 noticing the places that you've pulled out the weeds and wanting to eat the dirt and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=76.8s	76.8	 screw around and dig.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 So instead of doing that in the first few weeks do your gardening while the puppy is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=83.5s	83.5	 in his pen or you can reinforce your puppy for watching you but I really suggest waiting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 a few weeks till you have a reinforcement history of the puppy listening to you and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=94.3s	94.3	 doing things for you before you expect your puppy to listen to you while you're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=98.9s	98.9	 something very exciting and you don't want your puppy to join in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 I suggest that the first time that you expose your puppy to something that could be exciting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=107.7s	107.7	 or arousing that you set it up as a training session rather than just leaving everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 to chance because most likely if you just let your puppy watch your kids play around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=117.5s	117.5	 with toys it's not going to go well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=119.8s	119.8	 The puppy most likely will want to chase the children and bite at their legs or grab their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=124.3s	124.3	 toy or maybe you know hang off of their clothing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=133.4s	133.4	 behaviors that you then have to untrain I suggest having your puppy on a leash and harness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 With some high value treats have your puppy watch your children playing in the living
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=142.9s	142.9	 room from a distance and feed your puppy for watching or you could have the puppy in a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=154.2s	154.2	 With my puppy Halo he's a herding breed so I especially made sure that the first time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=159.2s	159.2	 that he saw fast moving cars, my dogs moving fast playing with toys or the squirrels and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 rabbits moving fast on my property that I was there setting it up as a training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=170.5s	170.5	 so he was on a leash and a harness I had high value treats and the first time he saw the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=174.8s	174.8	 movement I fed him a high value treat for calmly standing or laying down while watching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=180.7s	180.7	 and then kept it short so he didn't get overwhelmed or frustrated and then set up a few training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dMKR5i9iNQ&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=248&pp=iAQB&t=186.7s	186.7	 sessions and what I achieved is a really easy puppy because what happens if you just let
