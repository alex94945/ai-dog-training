https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 These games are great for building your dog's confidence, coordination and balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 I'm not focusing on speed in these games because they're more about enrichment and safety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=62.6s	62.6	 so if you're interested in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=70.7s	70.7	 preparing to have your dog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 I don't suggest doing all these exercises super fast because the faster you do stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 the more likely for injury. You want to make sure to use a non-slip surface to play all these games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 and if your dog is ill or really old or might have an underlying health condition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=93.5s	93.5	 you want to ask your vet first before they do all these sorts of exercises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=98.5s	98.5	 but they can always be done slowly so I have some old dogs and I'm doing all the exercises where they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 walking so if they go through a tunnel they're walking through a tunnel so it can be fun and enriching for any dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 here's Kiko my 16 year old going over a little bridge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 If you have a puppy and you're wanting to do these exercises I suggest watching my puppy safety video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 that I've linked in the description below that goes over the important things to consider
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 when doing activities with your pup. Most agility trainers won't even train jumps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 they'll just train the dog going around poles first before even adding the jumps in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 so that I suggest you should do with puppies but if you have a pool noodle laying on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 it's perfectly fine if the puppy learns to walk over pool noodles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 you could even do a cavaletti course where the puppy's learning to move their back feet over the pool noodles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=151.2s	151.2	 as a fun exercise instead of doing the jump jump
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=155.2s	155.2	 you can teach your dog to go over stepping stones using stools or rocks or trunks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=161.2s	161.2	 and it's a great exercise to teach your dog to mindfully move through the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=167.2s	167.2	 so I'm just going to put a treat there there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 and the reason I'm putting the treats down is so he's focused on seeing where he's going rather than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=177.2s	177.2	 looking up at me for the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=179.2s	179.2	 good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=187.2s	187.2	 oh he wants to do it and not eat the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=189.2s	189.2	 here I've affixed a piece of pool noodle underneath a mini ironing board as a teeter for my little dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=197.2s	197.2	 you could use a plank for this as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=199.2s	199.2	 I'm going to use a little piece of paper to hold the treats in place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=203.2s	203.2	 as a teeter for my little dogs you could use a plank for this as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=209.2s	209.2	 to make weave poles you can use posts sticks or even pool noodles which I'm using here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=215.2s	215.2	 and you can secure the pool noodle to the ground using a small post or you can do what I'm doing here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=221.2s	221.2	 which is just zip tying it to longer grass which is a great idea for doing in a park if you're worried about hammering stakes into the ground or something like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=229.2s	229.2	 keep in mind this idea is for enrichment purposes so if you had a really fast dog they might just knock them right out of the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=237.2s	237.2	 there are many ways to train weave poles this way you angle the poles to the left and the right to make it easier for the dog to go through at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=247.2s	247.2	 yes good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=249.2s	249.2	 you can make a tunnel for enrichment games by draping a blanket over a table or if you have a small dog over a stool a chair or side table
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=258.2s	258.2	 you could also purchase a cheap children's toy tunnel but these are not made for competitive agility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=264.2s	264.2	 you want to make sure to be doing the exercises slowly where the dog's walking through or trotting through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=269.2s	269.2	 or not building up enough speed where they could get hurt or entangled in the tunnel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=273.2s	273.2	 in this footage I'm using a tunnel made for cats for my chihuahua epic when she was a tiny puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 here I've put a treat in the beginning of the tunnel and then I race to the other end to call Tyrion through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=287.2s	287.2	 Tyrion! Good job! Tyrion! Good boy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 I am by no means even a novice in the sport of competitive agility these exercises are just meant to have fun and enrich your dog's life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=304.2s	304.2	 if you have a dog that can't jump you can create these hoops for your dog to go through I just use two pool noodles zip tied together to create this hoop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=313.2s	313.2	 you can also teach your dog to go around a laundry basket or any sort of obstacle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=319.2s	319.2	 awesome! Good job! So you can call it different directions so for me this is go round and then the other one is go circle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=332.2s	332.2	 for jumps I used an idea that I found online which is pool noodles and laundry baskets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=338.2s	338.2	 if your dog knows to stay on a platform it can be helpful with teaching them to wait before jumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=343.2s	343.2	 ready? break! yes! good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=349.2s	349.2	 once your dog has learned the obstacles you can put a course together I suggest feeding a treat after every obstacle at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=356.2s	356.2	 jump! yeah! good boy! jump! good! jump! good jump! yeah! sweet!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=372.2s	372.2	 there are lots of opportunities to play agility games when out in nature or in your backyard you just have to be creative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYjZTr_XeI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=148&pp=iAQB&t=380.2s	380.2	 epic! go circle! good! epic! go round! good! jump up! go hop! hop! hop! good!
