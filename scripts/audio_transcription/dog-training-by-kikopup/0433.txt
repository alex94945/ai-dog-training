https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, this is my dog training tip of the day for today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=4.0s	4.0	 It's regarding counter conditioning or changing your dog's emotional response to a certain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=8.9s	8.9	 stimuli or trigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 A lot of people who are using counter conditioning are finding that they're getting no results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=16.8s	16.8	 And when you're getting no results, you can tell yourself that you're not doing it correctly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 Some of the reasons why when using classical or counter conditioning, you're not getting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 any results is one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=28.3s	28.3	 The main reason, number one, is that the dog is not finding the trigger, a predictor of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=34.5s	34.5	 the reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=35.9s	35.9	 So if your dog is not finding the trigger, a predictor of the reinforcement, you're wasting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=39.9s	39.9	 your time and you're just basically reinforcing your dog for nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=45.2s	45.2	 You really want to make sure that the trigger is the predictor of the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 Here's an example of someone who is me screwing up big time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 My Border Collie Splash used to be very reactive to human beings and dogs after being attacked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=59.9s	59.9	 as a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=61.2s	61.2	 And she made great progress in all environments except when we were walking in the canyon,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=67.2s	67.2	 which is there's brush, there's bushes this high so she can't see over them and a long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 path.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=73.6s	73.6	 And as we'd be walking along, another human being would be walking up the path and I would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 see the human being, get my treats ready, and as she saw the human being, I would feed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=82.8s	82.8	 her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=83.8s	83.8	 And I wondered why she was not getting better in this environment until I finally realized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 that even though I got the treat out way before she saw the person, she still saw the predictor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=93.7s	93.7	 that the food was coming, was me getting the treat out of the bag, and she was waiting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=98.5s	98.5	 till I gave her the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=100.4s	100.4	 So the person walking up the path was not predicting my reinforcement that I was giving
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 Even if I clicked her for looking and feeding her, that first signal that the treat was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=110.2s	110.2	 going to come to her, the predictor of the food, was when I got the food out of my bait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 So to solve this problem, I simply kept food in my hand on walks in the canyon and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 when the person appeared, I would feed her for looking at the person and suddenly there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=125.8s	125.8	 was a huge change in the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=129.0s	129.0	 She started to get more comfortable with people passing in the canyon where before there was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=133.2s	133.2	 absolutely no change no matter how much training I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=136.6s	136.6	 And I basically wasted like eight months of doing absolutely no classical or counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=142.1s	142.1	 conditioning because I was basically training her to like treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 Everybody can screw up, so the sign that you're screwing up is when you're seeing no change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=152.8s	152.8	 whatsoever.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 dog being focused on the food or distracted by the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 If you're working with your dog on trying to change their emotional response to something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=167.6s	167.6	 in the environment and your dog is busy staring at you and being over aroused about the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=172.3s	172.3	 that you're holding, you're not going to do any classical conditioning or counter conditioning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 Your dog is going to be only, if you're feeding your dog at that point in time, you're actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=181.1s	181.1	 building your dog's arousal on treats and not creating a relationship between the trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=189.9s	189.9	 and the reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 So what you need to do instead is backtrack and start with games of teaching your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=197.5s	197.5	 to stop focusing on the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 To do this, you simply sit on the couch and wait for your dog to stop thinking about the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=205.6s	205.6	 food while you're holding some food in your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 And here you can see Splash is thinking about the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=210.9s	210.9	 She's going, she's smelling the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=213.4s	213.4	 Even if she's not looking at me because she knows the game of ignore the food during training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=218.6s	218.6	 she's still thinking about the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=220.2s	220.2	 So that moment that she's not thinking about the food, I'm going to reinforce her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=224.2s	224.2	 And you'll see that in a second because I'm going to wait quite a long time for her to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 be absolutely not thinking about the food when I reinforce her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=232.0s	232.0	 Once you start playing games like this, you play the game where the dog's settling and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=236.0s	236.0	 not thinking about the food, try in different rooms of the house, then try on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 If your dog's trotting next to you and they're looking up at you, they're thinking about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=244.3s	244.3	 the food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=245.3s	245.3	 So the moment your dog is distracted by maybe a blowing leaf, that's the moment you're going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 to pop a treat in your dog's mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=253.8s	253.8	 Okay so finally Splash has stopped thinking about the food right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=257.9s	257.9	 So I'm going to take one of my T-R-E-A-Ts and present it to her face and I will capture

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=275.0s	275.0	 scared of humans and you're clicking too much.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZY4P9HKh1A&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=434&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 giving is to not click but as the dog looks at the object or the person or the other dog,
