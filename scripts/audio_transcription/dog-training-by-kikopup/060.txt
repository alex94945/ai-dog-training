https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, this video was chosen by the Kikopup members in a poll. It's a service dog training game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=7.1s	7.1	 Basically, you're teaching your dog a default behavior to do when you reach a counter and you do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=13.8s	13.8	 Distracting or you you're messing with something that's distracting. So you might be checking out from a store
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 You might be taking something off of a shelf or putting something onto a shelf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=24.7s	24.7	 When out and about or you're handling something distracting above the dog's head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=30.5s	30.5	 So you can choose what behavior you want the dog to do and then play it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 Train it in training games in training setups and I'm going to show you some examples
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=40.9s	40.9	 So you might want your dog to stand calmly at your side
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 Which I prefer or maybe you want your dog to block you from behind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=48.9s	48.9	 Or maybe you want your dog to sit or lay down or maybe you don't want your dog right in front of you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=55.2s	55.2	 It's really whatever you want your dog to be doing. There's no right answer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=60.2s	60.2	 So I mean besides jumping up on the counter and licking the person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 For most service dog public access training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=67.4s	67.4	 It's a great idea to work on the behaviors inside your house where there's no distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=72.3s	72.3	 So you can build the reinforcement value of the behaviors and the cues the situational cues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=78.6s	78.6	 Before bringing them out and about then the next step is you can take the behaviors into situations like here in this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 Where I'm working with halo who I think is nine months old in this video and I'm working on the concept of a default
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=92.9s	92.9	 Behavior in front of a counter here. I am practicing talking to someone on the other side of this barrier who is off-camera
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 I also have some treats on the counter to simulate a distraction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=104.0s	104.0	 That's on the counter and I can practice taking my cards out giving them to the person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=109.5s	109.5	 Taking them back putting things on the counter taking them off and also the types of behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=115.1s	115.1	 I might do when I'm talking to someone across across a counter for me such as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=120.8s	120.8	 Petting my dog and not paying attention to them and doing arm gestures as well as any sort of distraction you might think of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=128.5s	128.5	 You
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=144.4s	144.4	 Can vary how you train this for example approaching a wall with no treats on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Placing the treats on the wall and marking and reinforcing your dog for leaving it if your dog has a great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 Verbal leave it cue you can say the cue leave it as you begin the game a couple of times and then stop saying the cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=162.6s	162.6	 Leave it so that the environment starts to cue the behavior so you don't have to say leave it every time you get to a counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 Let's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=173.3s	173.3	 Leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 Ready if your dog goes for the food that's on the counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=179.9s	179.9	 Simply use your leave a cue and make an about turn and walk away from the counter and then make it easier for the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=186.8s	186.8	 So use lower level distractions or stand a little bit further away from the counter at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 You can also set the dog up for success by as you reach the counter marking and reinforcing the dog before they think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=199.9s	199.9	 To go and sniff the counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=209.8s	209.8	 Okay, how much is that? Oh, thank you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 Once your dog finds it easy to do a basic approach to the counter and leave the treats on the counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=222.3s	222.3	 You can start to vary the things that you do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 You can use different types of treats of different types of values
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=228.5s	228.5	 you can move around and pretend you're putting things on the counter or actually put things on the counter and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=234.3s	234.3	 practice talking and having a conversation a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=237.7s	237.7	 Lot of service dog trainers might not want to give the dog the treats in the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=243.2s	243.2	 So you might want to always give the dog the treats off your person and not the treats that are the the distraction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=250.2s	250.2	 In my own training, I don't end up with any problems from this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 But if you did have a service dog that was reluctant to want to go near a counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=259.4s	259.4	 Where there's someone behind the counter perhaps they don't like the way the cash machine sounds or something like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=264.8s	264.8	 This exercise can help the dog want to approach counters. Let's go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=289.2s	289.2	 Leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=294.5s	294.5	 Leave it let's go that was hard. Oh good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 Now it's become a default leave it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=315.2s	315.2	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=318.7s	318.7	 You can also work with lower shelves where the distraction is right in front of the dog's face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 Say for example, you go to a counter and they have food that's on shelves all the way down to the floor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=330.3s	330.3	 underneath the counter or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 You're reaching for something on the top shelves and your dog's face is right near the lower shelves while you're not looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=349.2s	349.2	 Good boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=350.9s	350.9	 In this part of the footage there are people that are distracting me and halo in the environment and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=357.3s	357.3	 If you can imagine that we were trying to train this behavior from scratch out in public that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 I'm not only training the behavior and working on my own distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=368.4s	368.4	 But I'm also working on the distractions in the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=372.4s	372.4	 So one thing you can do is work on stuff at home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 But then take your dog out and just work on a settle and mark and reinforce them for looking at the distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=381.4s	381.4	 And then while you're working on the exercise if the dog notices a distraction and doesn't move towards it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=387.1s	387.1	 You can mark and reinforce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 If your dog is having a problem while you're reaching and taking something off a counter or putting something onto the counter where they jump up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=396.6s	396.6	 Or they touch whatever it is that that's going onto the counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=401.2s	401.2	 I suggest watching my video on counter surfing because it also goes over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7v1_C5b6s&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=61&pp=iAQB&t=407.0s	407.0	 The teaching the dog a default leave it when you're handling things in the air starring gummy bear the Aussie
