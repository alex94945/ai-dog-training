https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey YouTube, this video is about door manners for dogs. Now, it's from my weekly inspirations program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 but because it's such an important safety behavior for dogs, I wanted to make it free and accessible to all of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=13.7s	13.7	 So I hope you enjoy it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 Door manners.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 Now with Lumos here, he loves door dashing and we haven't yet worked on it because it hasn't been a problem as of yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 because we have a fenced in yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=26.4s	26.4	 But we've decided that we would like to work on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=29.6s	29.6	 So because Lumos' motivation is to come outside and that's why he's so excited,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=35.2s	35.2	 we're going to start the door manners by working on him going inside, which is way easier for him because there's less motivation to run inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=48.6s	48.6	 So the first step is going to reach for the door and waiting for your dog to look at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=56.3s	56.3	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=58.5s	58.5	 And feed away from the door crack. So don't feed your dog with his face in the crack of the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=69.1s	69.1	 If your dog has a very hard time looking away from the door crack because it's a very ingrained behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=74.7s	74.7	 you can try a different door than the door that your dog rushes out of, say for example, the door to the bathroom or the door to a cupboard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=82.4s	82.4	 with the dog on leash to get your dog to learn the game of looking at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=86.9s	86.9	 Once your dog has gotten past the step where you touch the door handle and wait and they can look at you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 awesome,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=95.2s	95.2	 then you can start to jiggle the handle or open the door crack a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=102.3s	102.3	 Now, I don't particularly want my dogs to sit before they go out the door,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=107.4s	107.4	 but if you want them as part of the behavior of wait at the door, you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=114.7s	114.7	 Also, if your dog offers it, I will take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 Now, if your dog were to run forwards towards the door crack,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 just close it very carefully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=129.9s	129.9	 But the idea isn't just to slam it in their face as a punishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=134.1s	134.1	 You're just preventing the dog from door dashing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=138.4s	138.4	 So in practice, opening and closing the door, when you do this, it isn't the cue to dash out, it's the cue to look at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=147.4s	147.4	 So I'm just going to wait until he looks at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=150.2s	150.2	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 Now, I have him on a leash and a harness so that if he did door dash, he wouldn't be reinforced for it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=162.2s	162.2	 because if he was off leash and whoops, he dashes out the door, he gets reinforced by getting to herd the bunnies outside the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 Also, if you don't have a safe environment in your yard, say you don't have a fence in your near busy road,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 you have to take safety precautions, even after you've trained this safety behavior, because you never know what might happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=182.7s	182.7	 So teaching this behavior isn't a way to avoid management and prevention of your dog running into a road or whatever the circumstances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=194.1s	194.1	 So when your dog is doing really well with opening it just to crack, you can try opening it all the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=200.3s	200.3	 But as you see, I'm holding the leash very gently and I know he's not going to pull like a maniac.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=205.5s	205.5	 So if you have a dog that really door dashes, I suggest tethering the dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=209.6s	209.6	 because if you're distracted with treats and clicking and looking for his eye contact, he might just dash out the door and you might let go of the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 So he's not looking back, so I'm going to close the door and make it easier for him to succeed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 Good boy. Well done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 If your dog just isn't thinking to look up at you, you can practice warming up with an eye contact game first before doing this door game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=245.2s	245.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=257.2s	257.2	 Another idea is if your dog is really excited about the door, you can be further away from it, but then you need a helper to open and close the door for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=265.2s	265.2	 Because when I open the door a little bit, it might be harder for him to look away because he's looking at the rabbits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=275.2s	275.2	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=280.2s	280.2	 Step two. Once your dog is reliably looking at you when you open the door all the way and waiting patiently, you can start to release your dog out into the area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=290.2s	290.2	 Now I suggest you use a release cue that's a calm release cue, something associated with getting out slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=297.5s	297.5	 You don't want to use the same release cue that you would use, say, if you do agility and you release your dog from a contact, or say you do a sit-stay and you release your dog to come running to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=307.5s	307.5	 Either do something like, okay, or if you're going together, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=311.5s	311.5	 Because what you might find is that you get to the door and you say, release, and then the dog runs and it becomes this anticipation exciting game where you want your dog to think that it's pretty boring to go outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=325.7s	325.7	 and the best thing is to be with you and inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=328.7s	328.7	 Okay, so I'm going to open the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=336.7s	336.7	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=337.7s	337.7	 And I'm going to say my new release cue, which is okay, and I'm going to click him, and then feed him back inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=346.0s	346.0	 Because I want the release cue to be a calm thing, I'm going to click him for doing the release, which is going outside, but then feed him back in here so that the best reward isn't actually out there and he's anticipating running out to get it, but he's also thinking that he might get rewarded back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 So I'm going to say, okay, good boy, and click and feed him back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=370.0s	370.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=384.0s	384.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 You're free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 So if your dog starts to not believe you, that okay doesn't mean okay, it means you're going to give him a treat, then do encourage him to go and do the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=400.0s	400.0	 You must calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=406.0s	406.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=411.0s	411.0	 Step three, add a verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=414.0s	414.0	 The next step is adding a verbal cue, if you wish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=417.0s	417.0	 Now, this is obviously the cue to wait at the moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 I reach for the door and I open it, it's the cue for him to look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=424.0s	424.0	 But if I want to add a verbal cue, I can then use it in other circumstances, like at a friend's house or a door that he doesn't know, like a crank door or a car door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=435.2s	435.2	 So I'm going to say the cue, wait, before I reach for the door handle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=438.2s	438.2	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=441.2s	441.2	 And click him for looking at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=445.2s	445.2	 I'm just going to drop a treat on the floor so that he looks away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=449.2s	449.2	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=451.2s	451.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=458.2s	458.2	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=461.2s	461.2	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=463.2s	463.2	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=465.2s	465.2	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=474.2s	474.2	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=476.2s	476.2	 So when my dogs are off leash, okay means to go through the door and you're free to do whatever you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=482.2s	482.2	 But if you're on leash, so you're going to go for a walk, my cue, my release cue at the door is let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=487.4s	487.4	 So the dog doesn't get the wrong idea that okay means run and do what you want and let's go means there's something attached to you so if you do run off you will hit the end of the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=499.4s	499.4	 Let's have you on the right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=507.4s	507.4	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=509.4s	509.4	 And I'm going to click and feed him before he thinks to rush ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=515.4s	515.4	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=517.4s	517.4	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=519.4s	519.4	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=521.4s	521.4	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=523.4s	523.4	 Step 4, proof the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=525.4s	525.4	 Step 4, now we're going to proof the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=528.4s	528.4	 We're going to use food, toys and other people as distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=532.4s	532.4	 So, you want to warm your dog up with the game of looking at you when the door opens or practicing your cue of wait.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=542.7s	542.7	 Before you begin, then add the distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=550.7s	550.7	 So with the dog on a leash and a harness so they don't hurt themselves and a very short leash, you're going to throw the treats at the door and then see if you can get that same behavior because now there is a distraction that the dog wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=565.7s	565.7	 So I'm going to click and feed the dog rapid fire so the dog doesn't think that the click means get the treats outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=572.7s	572.7	 Ready, tug?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=575.7s	575.7	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=577.7s	577.7	 If it's too hard for your dog, you can simply take steps away from the door and click your dog for paying attention to away from the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=588.7s	588.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=595.7s	595.7	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=600.7s	600.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=602.7s	602.7	 Now if you release your dog to go eat the treats, you need to keep the leash loose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=607.7s	607.7	 So now I'm going to say okay and then follow the dog so that the leash is loose because I released him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=614.7s	614.7	 Are you home?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=615.7s	615.7	 Hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=617.7s	617.7	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=620.7s	620.7	 Hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=622.7s	622.7	 So now we're going to tempt him with the sound of a rustling treat bag because that's something that he really gets excited by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=630.7s	630.7	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=632.7s	632.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=634.7s	634.7	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=642.7s	642.7	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=644.7s	644.7	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=652.7s	652.7	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=656.7s	656.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=657.9s	657.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=659.9s	659.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=668.9s	668.9	 Now I didn't release him immediately after taking his leash off because I don't want him to think that me taking the leash off is the release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=676.9s	676.9	 So I'm clicking and reinforcing and now I'm going to say okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=682.9s	682.9	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=684.2s	684.2	 If you are doing this game and your dog can't offer you attention, you can walk away from the door so the distraction is further away or you can make the distraction go further away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=695.2s	695.2	 But that might be frustrating for some dogs so it's better if you turn, walk away from the door and start from further back in the room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=701.2s	701.2	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=702.2s	702.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=706.2s	706.2	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=709.2s	709.2	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=710.4s	710.4	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=717.4s	717.4	 So he's having a hard time with the frisbee so we're going to try from further back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=727.4s	727.4	 Well done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=731.4s	731.4	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=736.4s	736.4	 Well done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=741.2s	741.2	 So Tug, my terrier here, I'm going to train him to wait to get into the car as a safety behavior because something terrible almost happened to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=751.2s	751.2	 My mom came to visit and she came out of the car and I just assumed he was going to say hi to her but instead he was excited to jump in the car and he jumped into her car just as she was closing the door and he made it by this much getting squished in the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=767.2s	767.2	 So obviously now I don't let him run off leash to someone who's opening and closing doors but I would like to work on it so that he knows he can't jump into the car unless he hears the cue, the release cue to get inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=781.2s	781.2	 So I want this to be a default behavior meaning that the door opening and closing is cueing him not to jump in, cueing him to wait until I give him the release cue because I don't want it to be just a verbal cue that stops him from jumping in in case I'm not around to say the verbal cue or I don't think to say it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=799.2s	799.2	 Okay, so with the car door open I'm going to come over here and simply click him for waiting before jumping in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=807.2s	807.2	 I'm going to have the leash short enough that he doesn't jump halfway and then fall backwards in mid-air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=815.2s	815.2	 So we're going to approach the car, I'm going to click him for waiting with the door open and then I'm going to close the door and click him as the door opens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=837.2s	837.2	 So my release for the car is going to be jump in because I have another release which means okay, which means you can do whatever you want but I don't want him to think when I say it that he can do whatever he wants in the environment, I want him to know that the release is to go in the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=861.2s	861.2	 So when I'm ready and he's doing really well I'm going to give him his release which is tug, jumping and reinforce him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=874.2s	874.2	 So you can proof jumping into the car with distractions as well. So I'm going to put his food in here and as I move to put it in I'm going to click him for standing still as I reach to put the food in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=891.2s	891.2	 Good boy, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=894.2s	894.2	 So you can do the same behavior of waiting a default wait to get out of the car as well. We don't like our dogs jumping out of the car because they can hurt their wrist joints and it's really taxing to jump from a high surface so we generally never let our dogs actually jump out on their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=911.2s	911.2	 We get the dog so the cue is to wait in the car and the release is that we go and get the dog out of the car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=920.2s	920.2	 So you can play the same game where you open the door a crack and feed the dog for staying back just like the door of the house and then you can proof in the same way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852vp3tm2ms&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=349&pp=iAQB&t=934.2s	934.2	 Bye Tugane, see you later.
