https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=7.8s	7.8	 Now the most traditional way to teach this is to put a treat up between your eyes like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 this, mark and reinforce the dog for looking at the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 There's nothing wrong with this technique, however it has an added step where you then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 have to teach your dog not to look at your hand, but to look at your face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=23.1s	23.1	 The method that I'm going to show you is based on a technique called capturing where you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=32.3s	32.3	 add a cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=33.3s	33.3	 However, with eye contact, most dogs will look at you if you make a kissy noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=38.9s	38.9	 Now this type of training I learned from my mentor Kyle Reham 13 years ago when I used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=45.1s	45.1	 to work at the shelter.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=60.1s	60.1	 Now you want to make sure not to move as you're clicking or saying yes, because what can happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=66.3s	66.3	 is the dog can look up at your face and then quickly down at your hand because he knows

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=82.7s	82.7	 If your dog doesn't look up at you when you make the kissy noise, you can make a breathing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 Then when your dog's looking up at you while you're sighing, you can add your kissy noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 as the cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=115.5s	115.5	 So you, good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=122.5s	122.5	 To add duration to the eye contact, you simply need to make your kissy noise and then wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 a couple more seconds before marking and reinforcing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 treat yet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=140.9s	140.9	 you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-VnSoP0o9Q&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=281&pp=iAQB&t=170.7s	170.7	 your dog and then make your kissy noise, have your dog look up at you, mark and reinforce.
