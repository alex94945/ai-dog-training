https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone! This is Kikopup's tip of the day for today. In my previous tip of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=5.7s	5.7	 the day someone had commented, how do you train a dog to drop when they're tugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 reliably? I already have videos on how to train this using food but I'm going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 show you how to train it using two toys. So you want to make sure that you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=19.6s	19.6	 two toys that the dog values equally or you want to have an extra valuable toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=25.1s	25.1	 in case the dog doesn't want to drop either of the toys but you want to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 when the dog is not too excited and you've already worked, I suggest you've
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 already worked on training the drop initially using a food, some very high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=38.4s	38.4	 value food that's more valuable than the toy you're using. So you're going to use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 low value toys that the dog isn't super excited about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=46.7s	46.7	 Blysee, ready? And then cue your dog to get it. Good. Drop. So you're going to say drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=52.5s	52.5	 and then flap the other toy around like this until the dog gets it. Now I'm going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=59.3s	59.3	 to say drop and then get it. So while he's tugging I'm going to say drop and flap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=63.6s	63.6	 this one and then I'm going to say get it. Good job. If your dog is too excited
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=68.3s	68.3	 they're going to want to jump for the toy. Well they might not but some dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=75.8s	75.8	 might. Drop. Get it. Good. So basically when I say drop before I then flap the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 which is also making him get the toy, it's going to teach him that drop is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=89.4s	89.4	 something exciting and fun which means he gets to get this other toy and if he
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 doesn't drop the toy when I do it I can just let go of that toy at first. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 So while I'm tugging like this and then I say drop I can make this toy then do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=108.4s	108.4	 that same thing. Drop. Good. Get it. Blysee, get it. Drop. Wish, get it. Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=118.4s	118.4	 Halo, here. Halo wants a different one. Drop. Halo, get it. Get it, Halo. Good. Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=125.3s	125.3	 So I'm going to reinforce him with this one because this is the one he really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=129.4s	129.4	 wanted and he played with the one that he didn't really want. So ready? Halo, go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 Wish, wait. Wishy, wait. This is for Halo. Halo, go round. Woo. Okay. Wish, get it. Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=144.1s	144.1	 Halo, uh, Bliss, get it. I got my dog's name wrong. Drop. Halo, come. Drop. Halo, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=152.8s	152.8	 Yeah. Drop. This is for Halo. Woo. Go get, oh now he wants this one. Bring Wishy. Okay now I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 going to say, um, come over here. Wait. This is going to be for Bliss and Wish. So Bliss, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=172.5s	172.5	 Wish, get it. Pull. Good job. Wish, drop. Wishy, drop. Come. Good job. Wishy, here. Let's try that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 again. That was slow. Bliss, get it. Wish, get it. Wish, drop. Come. Good. So you can see you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=191.4s	191.4	 get quite a nice drop, um, which is a good emergency behavior if you have a dog that gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 aroused with playing tug or maybe they guard toys. Bliss, get it. Wish, get it. Pull. Pull the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=205.2s	205.2	 Pull the puppy. I'm going to give it to Bliss here and Wish, pull. Bliss, drop. Bliss, drop. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=213.8s	213.8	 Bliss, get it. And so when I'm teaching Bliss to initially drop it while he's playing with Wish,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=219.8s	219.8	 I'm going to be holding the toy because I'm not sure if he'll do it. Do you want to play this tuggy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 game? And it just wants to run in circles. Get it. Bliss, get it. Good. Bliss, drop. Good. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 Pull around. Pull around. Pull around. If you have a dog that when you hold the toy out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=237.9s	237.9	 they take it kind of tentatively or they grab it not as forcefully as you want. Instead of sticking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=243.7s	243.7	 it out in their face like that, you want to move backwards with the toy so the motion is away and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=249.6s	249.6	 that's going to help them build confidence with wanting to get it. So I'm going to say, get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 and move backwards. Drop. Because if I say, get it, drop, get it, or even hold it still, get it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=260.9s	260.9	 he's kind of like, get it. Drop. Where if I say, get it, drop, get it. Yes. Drop. Get it. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=270.6s	270.6	 And I can say, drop, go around, get it and move it away from him. Drop, go around, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=277.7s	277.7	 Drop. So I'm taking a step to the left. Go around, get it. Good. That's nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 And then go around, go circle, get it. Good. That's a nice grip. That's a nice grip. Yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 that's a nice grip. Woo. Ready? Woo. Woohoo. Woohoo. Drop. Up. Nice. Drop. Drop. Wait. Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 Yeah. Drop. Get it. Oh, good boy. Drop. Get it. Good job. So these are two new toys that I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=317.2s	317.2	 bought today. That's why they look nice and new. And I'm working on the drop and get it with these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=323.4s	323.4	 two new toys. And he's doing really well. So I'm actually letting him tug for longer. Get it. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=329.8s	329.8	 tugging for longer and being excited can increase the likelihood of the dog not wanting to let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=335.6s	335.6	 So you might just drop the toy and say, drop, get it. Good boy. And then make a big deal about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=341.1s	341.1	 the dog dropping it for this one. Bring. So I can play tug with this one, then say drop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=347.1s	347.1	 and then throw the other one. Woo. To get him used to the concept of dropping it, dropping when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=353.3s	353.3	 he's pulling to get a toy. And then I can just fade out the extra toy. Go get it. Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=359.4s	359.4	 Good boy. Oh, he didn't see it. Good boy. Okay. Now I'm going to try with just one toy. Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=366.2s	366.2	 Here we go. Get it. Yeah. Drop means I'm going to throw it. Woo. So if your dog really hates fetch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=375.3s	375.3	 don't say drop and then throw it. Say drop and then get it. Because especially if it's a hot day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=382.5s	382.5	 because they're going to be like, oh no, drop means I have to run over there and get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=386.1s	386.1	 Good. Go. Ready? Drop. Catch it. Drop. Catch it. Drop. Catch it. Drop. Catch it. Drop. Catch it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQsHWkTpv9Y&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=99&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 Drop. Catch it. Good boy. Drop. Twirl. Get it. Woohoo. Thank you so much for watching. If you'd like
