https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=4.0s	4.0	 Once you've trained your dog a reliable Leave It cue away from food using only positive reinforcement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 you can teach your dog the cue applies to other dogs and people as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 If your dog is scared of people, use a person your dog likes in the training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 and then practice from other people at a distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 Dixie, leave it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 If your dog doesn't turn away when you say Leave It, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 1. Encourage a dog with your voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 2. Walk backwards and away from the distraction with your dog on a leash and harness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 and 3. If it keeps happening, work from further away and then move closer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 Leave it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 Step 4. Practice the Leave It away from a person with a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 In the first few training sessions, you want to use a dog that your dog is most comfortable with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 so a dog your dog lives with or one of your dog's friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 If your dog isn't comfortable with any dogs, you simply have to work with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 at a distance that your dog is comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 For your dog, that might actually be 30 feet away from the other dog, or even more than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 Because Deis the Rottweiler was comfortable with the other dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 I could walk straight towards the other dog and then use my Leave It cue and walk the other way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 You can also click and treat your dog for walking on a loose leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 as well as choosing to leave the other dog on their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 If you're worried your dog might bite the other dog or person,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 make sure to keep a distance so that your dog is out of reach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 and have your dog in a safe muzzle just in case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 Step 6. Add criteria and distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 In this shot, I'm adding the criteria of the duration of the behavior Leave It.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 Here we are adding criteria to the Leave It cue with two Yorkies that like to bark at dogs that walk past their window.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 Because the Yorkies were doing so well, we added the distraction of getting the other dog to bark on cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 Let's try off leash, since you did so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 What's she doing out there? Leave It! Good job!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 If your dog is reactive or guards food or space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 do not get close enough to the other person or dog where your dog will react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=242.0s	242.0	 Instead, practice your cue at a distance that your dog is comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=246.0s	246.0	 This cue can also be used for dogs that are overly friendly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 in order to get them away from a person who might be over-exciting your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 If your dog really likes the person in the dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 you can give your dog permission to go say hi as a reward for good behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 What's the big deal about using intimidation?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 When using old school dog training, a trainer might use intimidation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=270.0s	270.0	 such as saying no, eh-eh, or jerking on the dog's leash to train them to leave things alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=275.0s	275.0	 The problem with using punishment and intimidation to train a cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=278.0s	278.0	 is that whether you like it or not, Pavlov is always on your shoulder,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=282.0s	282.0	 and the dog will start to have a conditioned emotional response to the cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 similar to the feeling the dog had when he was punished by the trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 If you were to continually pair a cue conditioned with punishment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=292.0s	292.0	 with another dog or person, the dog would start to associate the other dog or person with punishment as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=298.0s	298.0	 This can be detrimental to your training if you are trying to get your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=302.0s	302.0	 to be more social and comfortable around people and dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=306.0s	306.0	 Fearful behaviors and reactivity are the side effects of an underlying behavioral problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 It can seem like training is working when you use punishment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=314.0s	314.0	 because the dog stops doing what you didn't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=316.0s	316.0	 However, you are suppressing the symptoms instead of addressing the cause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=320.0s	320.0	 By using a leave it cue trained with only positive reinforcement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 you are not only asking for an alternate behavior to do instead of the one you didn't like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 but you are also pairing the person or dog with a cue that your dog finds highly reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWdU5Hgdtmc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=381&pp=iAQB&t=333.0s	333.0	 This means that you will be conditioning a reinforcing association with the dog or person when you use the cue.
