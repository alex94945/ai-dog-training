https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone in this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=1.8s	1.8	 I'm going to be talking about how to read your dog's body language in training sessions and how it can help your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=8.2s	8.2	 Now a lot of you might know that I train without the use of physical or psychological intimidation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=13.5s	13.5	 but it's really up to the dogs to tell us what is intimidating to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=17.8s	17.8	 We can have ideas about what might be intimidating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 but we really have to know how to read our dog's body language in order to see if they are finding something that we're doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 intimidating. So during training sessions when you're training your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 you can actually look at their body language and find out if they're finding something about the training stressful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 punishing or perhaps even intimidating. To begin with let's look at the ear positions of the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=44.4s	44.4	 When training a dog you want to shoot for the ear position on the left, pointed at you, relaxed or perky.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=50.6s	50.6	 I call these ears expectant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=52.6s	52.6	 They are expressing that the dog is expecting something good to happen that he's not conflicted about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=57.6s	57.6	 The ear position on the right, pointed away from you, gives you information that your dog might be feeling somehow conflicted,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=64.8s	64.8	 uncomfortable or anxious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 Don't panic if you see your dog's ears going back during training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=70.7s	70.7	 Your dog is just communicating with you. When you see the ears go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=74.4s	74.4	 you can tweak your training plan by breaking the training up into smaller steps and trying to figure out what it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 that's making your dog feel uncomfortable so you can get those ears back up and looking perky and relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=85.8s	85.8	 The ears are not the only sign that your dog could be feeling conflicted or uncomfortable about a training task.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=91.9s	91.9	 Some dogs might be showing other signals but have relaxed or perky ears at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=96.8s	96.8	 For example a dog that really wants his ball that you're holding and as you pet him his ears stay forward,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=102.9s	102.9	 pointed at the ball, but he hunches his head and winces his eyes and licks his lips many times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=108.4s	108.4	 This could tell you that the dog is uncomfortable with being petted while you're holding the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=113.8s	113.8	 Ear movement however is quite an obvious signal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=117.3s	117.3	 especially for beginner trainers and should not be ignored as they give you so much information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=122.9s	122.9	 Keep in mind that if you're standing behind your dog your dog's ears will be pointed in your direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=127.9s	127.9	 So for example if they're in a sit-stay in front of you and they're about to take an agility jump,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=132.0s	132.0	 they most likely will be looking at the jump, but their ears will be pointed backwards listening to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=137.3s	137.3	 Now it's also really important to understand that this advice is for during training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=142.7s	142.7	 In your dog's everyday life they'll put their ears back for many reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=147.1s	147.1	 For example if you're saying hi to your dog and your dog is submissive they most likely will put their ears back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=152.9s	152.9	 Also if your dog is greeting another dog they might also put their ears back for that as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=157.8s	157.8	 So don't panic if you see your dog put their ears back. This is just in training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=163.1s	163.1	 Observing the dog's gaze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=164.5s	164.5	 When a dog is directly in front of you during a training session the dog's gaze should ideally be pointed at you, the reinforcement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=172.1s	172.1	 or in the direction of the task. If you notice your dog's gaze starting to point away from you or the task,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=178.3s	178.3	 this gives you vital information about what to do next in the training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=183.1s	183.1	 If your dog looks away this means he's not paying a hundred percent attention and is not 100% in the training game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=189.5s	189.5	 When a dog starts to look away you can reassess if something is causing the dog to feel uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=194.7s	194.7	 This could be some unintended social pressure you weren't aware of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=198.3s	198.3	 For example if you're leaning over your dog. If you believe this is not the case you can see if using a higher value of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=205.6s	205.6	 reinforcement will get your dog back in the game. If this doesn't work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=208.9s	208.9	 it's not a good idea to train new behaviors without having your dog's full attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=213.6s	213.6	 You can either give your dog a break or ask him for behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=216.8s	216.8	 he already knows and loves and use a high rate of reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=220.9s	220.9	 It's normal for dogs to be slightly distracted during training when working in new environments for the first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 So I suggest when you begin training somewhere new warm up with attention games, your dog's strongest behaviors or settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=234.6s	234.6	 Dogs can look away in training sessions for many reasons. For example, they're uncomfortable or stressed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=240.1s	240.1	 they're distracted by something in the environment, the reinforcement is not of high enough value,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=245.7s	245.7	 or the training session has just gone on way too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=249.5s	249.5	 Now we're going to observe the dog's posture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=251.6s	251.6	 The ideal picture is that your dog's posture is relaxed in a neutral position or leaning towards you, the task, or the reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 When you see your dog's neck and chest start to shift away from you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=264.0s	264.0	 downward to the side or back away from you or the task, this is giving you information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=270.5s	270.5	 Imagine you are talking to someone and you see them leaning their chest and their neck in your direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=275.3s	275.3	 They most likely feel comfortable with you and are engaged in what you have to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=280.0s	280.0	 Then you see them start to lean away from you. Something has changed. If they are just getting comfortable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=285.7s	285.7	 that's a different story,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=286.9s	286.9	 but if you see the center of their body start to point elsewhere besides at you, it's information and the same is true with dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=295.1s	295.1	 It can be a little bit tricky to train your dog and also pay attention to your dog's body language.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=300.5s	300.5	 So I suggest filming your training sessions, train your dog, and then watch the footage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 This will give you a lot of information about what made your dog comfortable, uncomfortable, or the whole training session was just great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYjS9Lh9gg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=255&pp=iAQB&t=312.9s	312.9	 Thanks for watching. I hope you found this information helpful for your training. If you'd like to become a supporting member of this channel,
