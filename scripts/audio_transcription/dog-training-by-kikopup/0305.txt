https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 This is a very basic description on how to use a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=3.3s	3.3	 First you're going to need a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 Now if you have a box clicker like this, I've not been able to find one that's not very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=10.9s	10.9	 loud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=11.9s	11.9	 This is extremely loud, it even hurts my ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=14.4s	14.4	 So what you need is some poster tack or very many layers of tape to stick over the dimple
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 in the clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=23.2s	23.2	 The next thing you're going to need is a dock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=25.3s	25.3	 Now you're ready to train with a clicker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=27.7s	27.7	 To teach your dog the concept of what the click means, you simply need to make the click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 the predictor that food will soon be following.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 Now if the food comes before the click, the dog is not going to find the click the predictor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=39.6s	39.6	 that the food is coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 So to do this, you need to mark, pause, then feed your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=46.1s	46.1	 If you move at the same time with the click and the food, what can happen is the dog can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 start to think that this means that the food is coming or this means that the food is coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 and not the noise itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=58.4s	58.4	 That can interfere with your training and you get a dog that's very fixated on your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=62.4s	62.4	 hands and as you can see, now that Spash has figured out what I'm doing, she knows that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 this doesn't mean that the food is coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 So you're going to mark, consciously think pause, then feed your dog a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 Now if you have a very active dog that's moving around, you want to make sure that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=80.5s	80.5	 not clicking your dog for doing something that you don't like because they can quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 learn, oh, every time I do this, she clips, for example, jumping up or pawing at your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=90.5s	90.5	 hand to get the treat out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=93.9s	93.9	 Some people skip that step altogether and simply jump into training behaviors using
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 a clicker and the dog learns the concept as they learn the new behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 So for example, a great behavior to teach the dog the concept of what the click means
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 is teaching the dog to touch your hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 Now if you held treats in your hands and you reach out towards the dog, they most likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=114.2s	114.2	 will sniff your hand to see if you have a treat in it and that moment you can mark with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 the clicker then move to feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=122.4s	122.4	 If you have a dog that's really chill around food, you can immediately start using the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 click to predict food and train new behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=130.8s	130.8	 However, if your dog's getting very excited by the food, you first need to teach your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=135.4s	135.4	 dog to chill and relax around food first before pairing it with the clicker because what can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=141.3s	141.3	 happen is if your dog is over aroused by food and you start pairing the clicker with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=145.6s	145.6	 the food, the click is also going to start making your dog too excited and what can happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=150.5s	150.5	 is you'll get a lot of stress signals coming out in your dog in the behaviors that you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=155.1s	155.1	 teaching and also your dog could start whining and barking and sometimes even shaking with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 excitement and it makes it very frustrating for the dog and the trainer to train new behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=166.8s	166.8	 when the dog is that excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBHCIEeZyc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=306&pp=iAQB&t=168.2s	168.2	 So the first step is teaching your dog to have the correct level of arousal around food.
