https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 Okay, go get it!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 Good girl!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 This is the Kikopup method of teaching a stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 First, you get the behavior using either capturing, free shaping, or luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 I'm going to show you how you can use luring in this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 Then once you've got that behavior going for a couple of seconds,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 you're going to immediately add a release cue, and then add stimulus control to the release cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 Stimulus control means the dog only gets up when they hear the release cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=78.0s	78.0	 no matter what is going on in the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Once you've got that dog with stimulus control on the release cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 then you can start adding criteria and variety to the stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 Step 1. Get the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 I like to keep the food in my right hand with the clicker on top of it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 and use my left hand for luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 One, because I'm left handed, and two, because the eventual hand signals are going to be done with my left hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 So firstly, you want to get the dog interested in following a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 Anywhere that treat goes, their nose goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=114.0s	114.0	 For teaching stays, I like to teach the dog to never move their two back feet, no matter what.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 So if they're in a sit and they go down, those back feet stay exactly there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 When they go into a stand, all four feet stay the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 Stand to down, all four feet stay in the same location.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 Down to sit, those two back feet are always in the same location.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 Sit to stand, those two back feet, there they are, they're glued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 That way, you can ask your dog to change positions at a distance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 and they never creep forwards because they always know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 that those two back feet are glued to the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Teaching multiple behaviors adds variety to training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=154.0s	154.0	 To teach the down from the stand, get the dog interested in the treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 and then while he's standing there interested in the treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 click for all of his four feet staying in the same place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 The next step is pushing the treat while his neck is straight backwards a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 You're going to be pushing it at a diagonal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 What I'm clicking for is these two leg muscles moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 The next step is going all the way down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 You're pushing your hand into the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=189.0s	189.0	 If you just push your hand downwards, you might get a bow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 So you're pushing backwards into the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 Teaching the stand from the down, you simply lift the treat up at the same diagonal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 I'm clicking for the dog moving his muscles as well as keeping his feet still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 If your dog's moving his feet a lot initially,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 just click for the muscle movements, forget about the feet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 and then once you've got the dog going down and up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 you can start clicking for the dog only keeping his feet still.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=223.0s	223.0	 From the stand to the sit, I like the dog to keep his two back feet completely glued in place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 So I'm going to push the treat backwards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 and click the dog for taking a step back with his two front feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 Then from the sit to the stand, I'm going to pull that treat forwards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 so that he takes two steps forwards and then two steps back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 So down from a sit, you simply just pull the treat down and forwards slightly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 Click as the dog goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 Some dogs, you can just put the treat directly on the ground and they'll go down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 If your dog is having trouble, just move slower and click approximations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 The dog's squatting and finally he goes down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=268.0s	268.0	 Down to sit, simply pull the treat at a diagonal up over the dog's head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=273.0s	273.0	 Here you can see I'm luring the same behaviors with a five week old puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 that's never worked for food before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 If you're not having success with the luring, it's not the dog's fault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=283.0s	283.0	 You're either luring incorrectly, the food isn't good enough,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=287.0s	287.0	 or you're in too distracting an environment for the dog to concentrate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 Puppy class is probably the worst place to train a dog a new behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=296.0s	296.0	 because there's just too many distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=300.0s	300.0	 So once your dog starts moving quite reliably into the different positions quickly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 with the lure, you can start going over the different positions before you click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 So here we go, we're going to go from a down to a stand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=312.0s	312.0	 back to a down, and then to a sit, and then to a stand before I click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=317.0s	317.0	 Down, sit, stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=320.0s	320.0	 I'm only saying the words so you can see the different positions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 You're not going to add a verbal cue yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=326.0s	326.0	 You're just practicing getting the dog to move how you want the dog to move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=336.0s	336.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=338.0s	338.0	 Fading the Lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 So immediately you want to get rid of that piece of food in your hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 that you're luring the dog with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=344.0s	344.0	 To do that, you basically just get a pretend treat and do the same hand movements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=349.0s	349.0	 Click, but there's no treat there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=351.0s	351.0	 The treat comes from your other hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=353.0s	353.0	 So the down, the dog follows the empty hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 You're holding it in the same way that you would have a treat in it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=359.0s	359.0	 but you're clicking the movement even though there's no treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=363.0s	363.0	 Click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 And you can either feed your dog with the hand that you used as the lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=367.0s	367.0	 or feed them with the other hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=369.0s	369.0	 but it's slightly difficult because you've got your clicker in there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 so you have to kind of shuffle things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=374.0s	374.0	 I like to use just the hand that I lured with to feed with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=377.0s	377.0	 There's no food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=378.0s	378.0	 Lure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 Click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=381.0s	381.0	 And the click marks the movement of following the empty hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 So once your dog's following your empty hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 you can practice removing your hand and clicking them for staying in the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=393.0s	393.0	 So they go down, remove the hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 You're clicking as the hand's being removed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 A lot of dogs get stuck with the hand having to be there for them to stay there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=402.0s	402.0	 and as soon as you remove the hand, they get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=404.0s	404.0	 So start that immediately or your dog could get stuck in the habit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=411.0s	411.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=414.0s	414.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 Then you can start removing your hand for longer and longer periods of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 while they stay in the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=424.0s	424.0	 Click
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=425.0s	425.0	 Morphing the lure into a visual cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=428.0s	428.0	 You can now teach your dog visual cues for the behaviors you've been luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=433.0s	433.0	 You could also add a verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=435.0s	435.0	 I have a video on that, and I'll link it up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 So at first, I'm going to click, do the lure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=441.0s	441.0	 and then I'm going to morph the lure into the hand signal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 So here goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=447.0s	447.0	 From this distance, it worked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=453.0s	453.0	 Then from this distance, and then from standing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=458.0s	458.0	 You might have to go back a step a couple times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=460.0s	460.0	 because if you always make it harder and harder, the dog could get frustrated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=464.0s	464.0	 For little dogs, hand signals look dramatically different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=467.0s	467.0	 from when you're kneeling to when you're standing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=470.0s	470.0	 Luring behaviors can be helpful down the line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=473.0s	473.0	 because when your dog becomes confused,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=475.0s	475.0	 you can always revert back to the hand signal to refresh the dog's memory,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=479.0s	479.0	 as shown in the next clip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=481.0s	481.0	 Down. If you didn't, I'm going to show him down on my hand signal, but no treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=487.0s	487.0	 Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=488.0s	488.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=489.0s	489.0	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=491.0s	491.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=493.0s	493.0	 Another thing you can do is ask for the behavior ten times,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=496.0s	496.0	 and then try it standing up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=498.0s	498.0	 So I'm going to say down, click, treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=500.0s	500.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=501.0s	501.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=502.0s	502.0	 Down, click, treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=503.0s	503.0	 Do that ten times, and I'm going to stand up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=506.0s	506.0	 and now she's probably going to lay down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=509.0s	509.0	 So I could add any cue that I wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=512.0s	512.0	 Say, for instance, hamster or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=516.0s	516.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=517.0s	517.0	 Hamster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=518.0s	518.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=520.0s	520.0	 So by asking for behavior over and over,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=522.0s	522.0	 it makes it predictable that you're going to say it again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=525.0s	525.0	 so she sees she's offering the down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=527.0s	527.0	 So now I'm going to stand up, and say hamster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=531.0s	531.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=532.0s	532.0	 Film yourself training your dog with hand signals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=535.0s	535.0	 to make sure that you're being clear and not sloppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=537.0s	537.0	 In this clip, I'm doing some very sloppy hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=541.0s	541.0	 Step two, train a release cue and add stimulus control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=545.0s	545.0	 Once your dog has started staying in the positions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=548.0s	548.0	 after you've removed your hand, you can add your release cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=552.0s	552.0	 To teach the release cue, say the cue while your dog is in a position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=556.0s	556.0	 then entice the dog to get up and come towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=559.0s	559.0	 Click as the dog gets up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=561.0s	561.0	 Great cues to use are free or release
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=564.0s	564.0	 because they do not pop up in everyday speech like okay does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=569.0s	569.0	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=574.0s	574.0	 Release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=576.0s	576.0	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=577.0s	577.0	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=578.0s	578.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=580.0s	580.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=583.0s	583.0	 Release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=585.0s	585.0	 So what I'm doing is I'm moving after I say release,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=588.0s	588.0	 so I'm not going release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=590.0s	590.0	 I'm going release, and then if he doesn't,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=592.0s	592.0	 I'm going to move to get him to kind of get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=595.0s	595.0	 Stimulus control on the release cue means,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=598.0s	598.0	 one, the dog gets up immediately when released,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=601.0s	601.0	 two, the dog never gets up when not released,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=605.0s	605.0	 three, the dog never gets up in response to another cue or stimuli,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=610.0s	610.0	 and four, no other behavior occurs in response to the release cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=614.0s	614.0	 besides getting up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=617.0s	617.0	 Hamburger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=619.0s	619.0	 Oranges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=620.0s	620.0	 Release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=622.0s	622.0	 To achieve stimulus control on the release cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=625.0s	625.0	 one needs to teach the dog that nothing in the environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=628.0s	628.0	 apart from the release word means get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=631.0s	631.0	 To do this, you will click as the distractions happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=634.0s	634.0	 and later click the dog after the distractions have happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=638.0s	638.0	 You will be teaching the dog that all the situations he thinks to mean get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=642.0s	642.0	 actually mean remain staying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=645.0s	645.0	 Start from the lowest level of distractions and move to the highest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=649.0s	649.0	 That doesn't mean get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=651.0s	651.0	 That doesn't mean get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=653.0s	653.0	 Apples doesn't mean get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=657.0s	657.0	 Cabbage juice doesn't mean get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=660.0s	660.0	 Hey, hi over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=662.0s	662.0	 That doesn't mean get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=663.0s	663.0	 But the word that he's waiting for,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=665.0s	665.0	 the only word that he can move on is release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=668.0s	668.0	 And I'm going to encourage him up if he thinks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=671.0s	671.0	 no, I think you want me to stay here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=673.0s	673.0	 Release actually is a cue to mean come to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=678.0s	678.0	 And get out of the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=682.0s	682.0	 So I'm clicking the exact moment that I do the distraction at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=686.0s	686.0	 But then once he's getting it, which he is, I can do the distraction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=690.0s	690.0	 do some more distractions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=693.0s	693.0	 and only click him for the hard one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=695.0s	695.0	 If the dog gets up, do not give the dog a treat for getting back into position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=700.0s	700.0	 As quickly as you can, lure the dog back into the location and the position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=705.0s	705.0	 and then make the distractions slightly easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=707.0s	707.0	 For a more advanced dog, you can simply repeat your hand cue or verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=712.0s	712.0	 The goal is that the dog never gets up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=715.0s	715.0	 So if your dog is getting up often,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=717.0s	717.0	 you will need to go back a step to where your dog is successful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=722.0s	722.0	 So because that's one that he might get up on, I'll use it as an example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=728.0s	728.0	 So just standing near his back, I'm going to click him for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=737.0s	737.0	 And then maybe just slowly stepping over and feeding him at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=744.0s	744.0	 And now I'm going to release him. Release!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=747.0s	747.0	 Here you can see Tug learning that no matter what I do with my body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=750.0s	750.0	 and no matter what comes out of my mouth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=752.0s	752.0	 the only cue that means get up is the release cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=756.0s	756.0	 Woo! Ha ha!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=759.0s	759.0	 Woo woo woo woo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=761.0s	761.0	 Woo hoo! Choo choo choo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=765.0s	765.0	 The neighbors are so excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=768.0s	768.0	 Pumpkins!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=770.0s	770.0	 And apples!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=772.0s	772.0	 And strawberries!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=774.0s	774.0	 And margots!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=777.0s	777.0	 And feet!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=778.0s	778.0	 And the feet!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=779.0s	779.0	 And the feet dance! The feet dance!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=781.0s	781.0	 Woo! Woo!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=785.0s	785.0	 Meow!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=786.0s	786.0	 Meow!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=788.0s	788.0	 This would be embarrassing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=791.0s	791.0	 Be creative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=793.0s	793.0	 Proof your dog to stay no matter what you do with your body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=796.0s	796.0	 no matter what comes out of your mouth besides the release word,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=799.0s	799.0	 no matter what food, toys, people, and other distractions are moving in the environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=805.0s	805.0	 Remember to release your dog and move away from stressful distractions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=809.0s	809.0	 like loose roaming dogs, loose roaming children,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=812.0s	812.0	 and other distractions that are unfair to make a dog stay through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=817.0s	817.0	 Now I'll add the distraction of a food bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=819.0s	819.0	 Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=826.0s	826.0	 So I'm clicking the exact moment that I wave the bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=831.0s	831.0	 And now I'm going to click as I drop it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=845.0s	845.0	 Now I'm going to wait a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=848.0s	848.0	 And I can wait until he looks back at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=850.0s	850.0	 If you wanted eye contact when you're around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=853.0s	853.0	 But I don't think that's very necessary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=856.0s	856.0	 Because then if you're not around, they can't look at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=859.0s	859.0	 I'm going to work on stimulus control with Tug around toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=863.0s	863.0	 I want to teach him that the only thing that means get up is the word free,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=867.0s	867.0	 not a moving toy or the presence of a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=870.0s	870.0	 You can see he really loves his toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=872.0s	872.0	 So if you know toys might be more irresistible than food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=875.0s	875.0	 you might want to start with something like a rock or something that's not even interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=879.0s	879.0	 Whereas you can see Tug, you know, he really likes his toys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=882.0s	882.0	 but he does love his food as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=884.0s	884.0	 First you could click the dog for just the presence of toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=887.0s	887.0	 Then you could click as you touched the toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=889.0s	889.0	 And then you could click as you slightly moved the toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=892.0s	892.0	 to the point where you could throw the toys,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=894.0s	894.0	 no matter what toy your dog's not getting up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=903.0s	903.0	 Here I'm teaching Tug that a squeaky toy doesn't mean get up either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=917.0s	917.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=941.0s	941.0	 Doing so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=943.0s	943.0	 If you have a dog that's faster than you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=945.0s	945.0	 it's a good idea to tether them in a leash and harness to something stable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=949.0s	949.0	 That way you can keep the distractions just out of reach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=952.0s	952.0	 and there's no chance of the dog reinforcing themselves for getting up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=970.0s	970.0	 So I could give him permission, you know, to go see the object if he wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=976.0s	976.0	 Now I'm going to walk around with the object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=978.0s	978.0	 I hope he doesn't get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=980.0s	980.0	 So I'm just going to move him and lay him down again without saying anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=986.0s	986.0	 And try it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=988.0s	988.0	 Make it a little bit easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=996.0s	996.0	 Oh, it's burning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=998.0s	998.0	 If he gets up and I've pricked, I'm just going to push him back into the same spot with the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1003.0s	1003.0	 Not really forcing him, but trying to get him to be down when I release the treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1007.0s	1007.0	 because I did click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1015.0s	1015.0	 Step three, raising criteria and adding variety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1019.0s	1019.0	 Raise criteria by combining the distractions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1022.0s	1022.0	 the distance you can get away from your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1025.0s	1025.0	 and the duration that your dog remains staying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1028.0s	1028.0	 Use a variable ratio of reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1031.0s	1031.0	 Basically put, the dog never knows when he will get a reward or be released.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1036.0s	1036.0	 Vary the rewards you use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1038.0s	1038.0	 Treats, toys, access to the environment, people, and other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1043.0s	1043.0	 Be unpredictable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1045.0s	1045.0	 Release your dog while you're next to your dog, as well as from different distances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1049.0s	1049.0	 Release your dog after short periods and long periods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1053.0s	1053.0	 A down is usually the most comfortable position for a dog to remain in for longer periods of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1059.0s	1059.0	 Make sure to have your dog on a harness and a long line during the training process,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1064.0s	1064.0	 so the dog is never reinforced for getting up without being released.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1070.0s	1070.0	 Here you can see me combining the distance, distraction, and duration of the stay at the park
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1076.0s	1076.0	 when my border collie was a 13 week old puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1079.0s	1079.0	 By using back chaining and teaching the release cue first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1082.0s	1082.0	 it makes raising criteria much easier and much faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1088.0s	1088.0	 The puppy never knows whether she's going to get to run after me and play with the tug toy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1092.0s	1092.0	 whether I'm going to return and give her a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1095.0s	1095.0	 or whether I'm going to go back, release her, and then we're going to go for a walk and she can sniff the bushes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1101.0s	1101.0	 The information in this video should enable you to teach your dog the most amazing state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1106.0s	1106.0	 However, I am making a DVD on the complete process of proofing, raising criteria,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msCmMaYtjpI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=501&pp=iAQB&t=1112.0s	1112.0	 and also getting these behaviors at a distance.
