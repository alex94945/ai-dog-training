https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=13.7s	13.7	 of membership. The reason that I'm so excited about these new levels of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=17.6s	17.6	 sponsorship is now I truly believe that I can make Channel Kikopup my full-time

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=36.6s	36.6	 And it was really awesome and I still will do a little bit of that but what I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 found is that I'm flying around the world as this one person and when I get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=46.7s	46.7	 to these conferences and seminars I'm literally preaching to the crowd, people

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=55.7s	55.7	 channel is increase the amount of people who have access to this information on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=60.5s	60.5	 how to train dogs without the use of physical or psychological intimidation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=65.6s	65.6	 And I don't think there's enough of this information out there for free for the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=69.9s	69.9	 general public to access through the internet which is what they're doing now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=73.9s	73.9	 So when people go on the internet they're not finding that information that I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tZMyzSY4JI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=235&pp=iAQB&t=79.3s	79.3	 believe is so necessary to have a compassionate and two-sided relationship
