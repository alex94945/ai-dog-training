https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ZKDPcB0HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=7.6s	7.6	 Instead of entering her house and trying to build a relationship by moving towards her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ZKDPcB0HU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=19&pp=iAQB&t=12.3s	12.3	 I am meeting outside on the street and reinforcing her for following me and building her motivation
