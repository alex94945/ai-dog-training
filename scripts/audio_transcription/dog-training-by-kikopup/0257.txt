https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, are you guys up for a trick challenge?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=3.0s	3.0	 Now a lot of you might have heard of the egg challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=5.5s	5.5	 where you offer your dog an egg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=7.2s	7.2	 Splash, take it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 and you see if your dog, Drop,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=10.6s	10.6	 can hold the egg without breaking it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=12.7s	12.7	 Now it sounds cool, however,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=14.7s	14.7	 most people just shoved an egg in their dog's mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=17.3s	17.3	 and either got a dog that would hold the egg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=19.2s	19.2	 looking pretty miserable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=20.7s	20.7	 or the egg broke and you either had a very happy dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=23.8s	23.8	 eating raw egg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 or a dog that was feeling slightly punished or confused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=28.7s	28.7	 Instead of that, I suggest teaching your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 to hold an Easter egg in the Easter egg challenge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 So can your dog hold one of these plastic eggs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 without snapping it and breaking it in two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=40.8s	40.8	 which means that the dog can actually hold the object very delicately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 Check out the link in the description for the video on how to train this trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=48.2s	48.2	 But the most important part of this trick is that your dog finds it fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 So you want to see your dog reaching for the egg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 rather than you putting it into your dog's mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 So you hold it just in front of your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 and you click your dog for taking the egg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=62.3s	62.3	 Another thing you want to keep in mind, take it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=64.7s	64.7	 is how your dog's ears look when your dog is holding the object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=68.5s	68.5	 If your dog is flattening their ears back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=70.8s	70.8	 it could mean that they're slightly uncomfortable about this exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=74.3s	74.3	 and if you make it more positive and more fun,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=77.1s	77.1	 you'll see that ears come forwards and look perky and relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 And the great thing about that is they'll look really cute in the picture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 when you take your picture of your dog holding the Easter egg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=87.1s	87.1	 in the Easter egg challenge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=89.1s	89.1	 Take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=90.3s	90.3	 If you have a dog who you think might swallow this or chomp on it and hurt themselves,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=93.8s	93.8	 then I suggest using a safe dog toy or safe prop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=96.7s	96.7	 to do the same trick of teaching a hold.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 Are you ready? Take it. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=101.8s	101.8	 If you want to do this challenge with a real egg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 I do suggest training your dog with positive reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=106.8s	106.8	 to hold one of these plastic eggs, because when it breaks open,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=109.9s	109.9	 it's not going to be as surprising or messy to clean up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 Are you ready? Take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=116.1s	116.1	 Drop. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=117.5s	117.5	 And this is the real egg. Ready? Take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=121.1s	121.1	 Drop. Awesome. And another real egg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 Sashie, can you take it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI52a3u_Qvw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=258&pp=iAQB&t=126.4s	126.4	 Drop. Good.
