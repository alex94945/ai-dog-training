https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody in this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=2.0s	2.0	 I'm going to show you how to initially train a recall or in other words come when called with a young puppy or any
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=9.5s	9.5	 rescue dog that you've just adopted. So this video is only going to cover the initial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=14.9s	14.9	 steps you're going to be conditioning the cue to mean run to you and then after this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=20.5s	20.5	 I'm going to show I'm going to make another video on how to proof the recall. So just this video isn't going to get you a reliable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 recall it's just training the behavior. The next step is proofing the behavior and building reliability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 around distractions and exciting things that the puppy might want to do instead of coming back to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=42.0s	42.0	 Especially because I have such a tiny puppy I've measured out how much food I can use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 This is her food for her breakfast that I'm using for training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=49.8s	49.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=52.7s	52.7	 The first step is feeding your puppy a treat and moving away from your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=57.1s	57.1	 You're going to mark and feed your puppy for moving towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=61.3s	61.3	 Then you can put a treat down on the ground and move away from your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 Click or say yes as the puppy moves towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=72.2s	72.2	 Now that she's reliably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=74.3s	74.3	 turning to find me after she eats the treat I can add the cue come right after I put the treat down and she's finished eating it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=82.2s	82.2	 Oh she's fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 Come. Good. So this is the first time we've played this game. Come. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=94.1s	94.1	 Come. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=98.6s	98.6	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=100.3s	100.3	 And there she wasn't done eating yet. So I need to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=103.3s	103.3	 waiting for that moment after she's finished eating the treat and just before she turns to come to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=112.9s	112.9	 She's also standing up on her back legs and I'm encouraging her to stand on all fours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 So when she gets to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=119.1s	119.1	 I'm gonna feed her at the appropriate distance that I want her to stand away from me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=125.2s	125.2	 And if she's standing up on her back feet I can reinforce her with all four feet on the floor like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=131.5s	131.5	 When you're running away from your dog like this you can give them one treat for coming to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 and then you run away from your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=137.9s	137.9	 But if you're playing the game where multiple people call your dog you want to make sure that you give your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=145.3s	145.3	 multiple treats before they then get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=147.9s	147.9	 recalled to someone else. Because what can happen is that the dog can start to think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=153.2s	153.2	 eating the one treat is then the cue to run away from you to go to the other person for a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=159.6s	159.6	 So you don't want to teach that and to get rid of that you just need to give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=164.4s	164.4	 multiple treats when the dog gets to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=167.1s	167.1	 By using this technique of first getting the behavior of the dog running to you and then adding the cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=172.9s	172.9	 you can add whatever cue you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=174.9s	174.9	 So if you have a very low voice you can say come just before you know your puppy is gonna run to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 However, if your puppy doesn't run to you after you use your low voice, you can then make an enticing noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 So you say come and then pop pop pop!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 Come!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=194.2s	194.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=196.8s	196.8	 Come!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=199.0s	199.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 If the puppy stops coming to you, stop saying the cue and go back to the step of simply marking the puppy for moving towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=175&pp=iAQB&t=209.4s	209.4	 Thank you so much for watching. If you'd like to support my work
