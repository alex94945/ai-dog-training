https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hello everyone, I'm going to be training my little puppy Cloud here. He's a terrier mix and he's about 13 weeks old today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 I pre-measured the amount of food he's going to be eating and today I'm going to be doing a real-time training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 where we're working on the concept of doing multiple behaviors before a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 So I am going to warm him up a little bit because I haven't worked on the platforms in a while,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 but sometimes I feel like, and this is just my own opinion, when you ask for multiple behaviors in the same area,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 they're more likely to think that they got the behavior wrong because that's usually how you train something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 and if they make an error they're right where they are. So instead, I'm going to cue him to go to a different area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 to do the different behaviors. So I can ask for multiple behaviors and then he's seeing that he's done the behavior right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 he gets to go to the next platform. Okay, so he has these two blue platforms which are just human exercise mats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 that I affixed Velcro strips to so they wouldn't slip on the carpet. So to begin with, I'm going to warm up by giving him a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 for every behavior. So I'm going to cue him to go platform. Good boy. And then cue him to sit. Good. Free. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 So for him, free means come to me. Go platform. Good. Down. Good boy. And now for paws up. Paws up. Free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Good boy. Oops, I dropped a piece. Good job. Paws up. Let's see if I can get him to turn right next to the couch. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Good boy. Okay, so now we're going to slip in a time where he does two behaviors before a treat and I like to give them a verbal praise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 which is good, which means you did it right. But the click is the marker that means a treat comes after every click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 So you might not agree with that type of training. You can. If you don't like to use verbal praise, you can just be quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 So you can, I'll do an example of that first where I cue him. I'm going to get two behaviors. So I'm going to ask him to go platform
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 and sit. It's actually quite a few behaviors, but two position changes. Free. Go platform. Down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 So he's done two behaviors for the treat like that. And I mark and I reinforce or I could say good and reinforce a different marker that he knows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 So what I like to do myself is I'll just give some verbal praise as well because I don't do obedience where you have to be quiet the whole time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 So I like to have my verbal praise also be in there to tell the dog they're doing it right. Are you ready? Free. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 Go platform. Oh, I got the cue wrong. It's paws up. But the visual cue is easy for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 So I'm going to get him to do a little bit of turning. Good. And then I'm going to cue him to go here and sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 And I'm talking to you, but I'm giving him visual cues as well. So that's why he's doing the behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 Crowd free. Go platform. Down. So now I'm going to mark him again so that it doesn't always get harder and harder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 So basically you're training on an average. So if you want him to do an average of three behaviors before a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 then you're not going to do three behaviors and four behaviors before a treat. You're going to do three behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 And then I like to make it drastically lower the next time. So one behavior before a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=242.0s	242.0	 So now I'm going to ask for three behaviors and and then mark and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 And the wonderful thing about little dogs, I'm being sarcastic, is they can't eat very much food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=253.0s	253.0	 So I only have this much left to work with in this training session. Free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 So I'm going to feed him. Good job. And then I'm going to cue him to do three behaviors before a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 I wanted to tell you, though, that I'm sitting here stuffing food in his face because I made him do quite a long duration down while I was talking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=281.0s	281.0	 So you have to consider that. What is a behavior? A behavior is one behavior, one verbal cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=288.0s	288.0	 No, a long duration down might be easy for one dog and seem like, you know, if you're working on an average of behaviors,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 it might seem like one behavior. But if it's something super hard for the dog, then I would definitely reinforce that behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 So maybe spinning or sitting is easy and downing is hard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=311.0s	311.0	 Then you might always try to reinforce the down and then work on asking for a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=319.0s	319.0	 Once that behavior is stronger, then you can start putting that behavior on an average.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 So you really want to only use behaviors. I forgot to mention this at the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=329.0s	329.0	 You should really only play this game where you're moving on to an average rate of reinforcement with behaviors that are super strong for the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=336.0s	336.0	 So I picked ones that are really good for him. And also, as you can see, he really enjoys going to the platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 OK, here we go. So I'm going to ask him to down. Good. Free. Go platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 Over here. Free. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=357.0s	357.0	 Sit. He was thinking for a little bit. Free. Pause up. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 And we're going to turn. Turn. Turn. Good boy. Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=372.0s	372.0	 And now we're going to jump up here. Sit. And I'm going to give him a treat because we did three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 And then I'm going to cue him to wave. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 And during this training process where you're asking for more behaviors before a treat or the situation is different,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 you can reinforce behaviors that aren't as pretty as you would want them to be normally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 So if you add criteria, you expect the behavior to look a little bit less good than you would want it to look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=404.0s	404.0	 OK, Pupsy. Did you see when I when I asked him to go over there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=409.0s	409.0	 I almost aborted the training session and went back to the one to one because he he refused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 He was like, no, that seems dumb. That's not a good idea. I haven't got my treat yet for being over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=421.0s	421.0	 But then he's learning, oh, if I go there, I'll get the treat. Wave. Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=428.0s	428.0	 Now I'm going to make it super easy. Go platform. He's not done eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=433.0s	433.0	 Well, he's got to think he's got to think. He said, I've done more tricks than I than I got treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=440.0s	440.0	 Good boy. So I'm going to give him multiple treats here just to make it fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=447.0s	447.0	 And then make this platform easy again so he doesn't get superstitious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=452.0s	452.0	 It was this one that was super hard. Free. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=457.0s	457.0	 And now I'm going to have him do a little bit of turning and then we're done with the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=463.0s	463.0	 Good boy. Good boy. Free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=469.0s	469.0	 So here's the remainder of the treats. I'm going to let him eat the treats like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=474.0s	474.0	 And then I'm going to say, oh, then see, they're all gone. You did good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=478.0s	478.0	 And now we're going to go out to the bathroom. Thank you so much for watching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbR0YXaMyvM&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=114&pp=iAQB&t=483.0s	483.0	 If you'd like to support my work, don't forget to like, comment and subscribe to my channel.
