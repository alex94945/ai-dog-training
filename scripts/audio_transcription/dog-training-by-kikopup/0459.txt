https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=4.0s	4.0	 If you're in a public area where dogs are required by law to be on leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 it is very unfair to let your loose dog run up to a dog on leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 This is because the dog on leash feels trapped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 He cannot escape and sometimes he'll feel like he has to defend himself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 as this little Jack Russell did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 This is unfair to both dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 The dog on leash felt frightened,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 and the dog that approached had the potential of being bitten in the face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 If you must have your dog off leash in an area where other dogs are on leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 you should keep your distance from the other dogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 and make sure you have a 100% reliable recall in case your dog wants to go and say hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 If you don't have a 100% reliable recall, don't let your dog off leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Have your dog on a long line,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 and that way they won't frighten other dogs and be in the potential danger of being bitten.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 When the dog ran over to my dogs at the park,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 I made sure to let go of my leashes so my dogs didn't feel trapped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=63.0s	63.0	 However, not everyone can let go of their dog's leashes when your dog comes running over loose,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 so be compassionate and considerate to all dogs you encounter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdLep2uQ-JU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=460&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 and ask permission before you let your dog meet other dogs that are on leash.
