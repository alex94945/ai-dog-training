https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=5.7s	5.7	 spinning in a circle on just a verbal cue and not with just hand signals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=10.7s	10.7	 So what I like to use is a comb and first teach the dog to offer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=16.3s	16.3	 turning around the cone first before then taking the cone away to teach the dog to spin without the comb.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=23.5s	23.5	 By having a visual of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=25.7s	25.7	 something they have to go around you can really help dogs out that are struggling to understand the concept of spinning when your hand doesn't move anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=36.1s	36.1	 So one simple way of doing this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=39.8s	39.8	 is just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=41.7s	41.7	 doing a honk so the grass will method of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 dropping little treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=46.5s	46.5	 So the dog is going around the cone in one direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=50.1s	50.1	 The next step is putting the treats further and further apart and what you're looking for is the dog to think offering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_dT-M8aeBI&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=316&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 turning around that cone in order to find the next treat and you can click that moment your dog turns in the opposite direction away from you.
