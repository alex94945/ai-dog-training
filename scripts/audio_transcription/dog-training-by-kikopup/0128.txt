https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czp0zc6Ksk8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=129&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 So it's a cue. Cue is a sign of action, a trigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czp0zc6Ksk8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=129&pp=iAQB&t=156.8s	156.8	 Through the exercise I will introduce you to, I will make the dog's hand look at the treat so that it cannot see the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czp0zc6Ksk8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=129&pp=iAQB&t=162.8s	162.8	 I will make the dog's hand take the treat in a state where it can see the treat
