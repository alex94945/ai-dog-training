https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everyone, I want to show you a trick that I use for teaching service dogs to pick up delicate objects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=6.0s	6.0	 Now, I have a video on teaching a dog to retrieve objects, which you can watch first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 but to teach a dog to pick up something that's delicate, you can use this method.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 Now, it's that time of year where you can buy these plastic Easter eggs that open and you can put things inside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 and they're the perfect thing for teaching your dog to hold an object delicately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 rather than picking it up and just crushing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 So instead of practicing with your credit cards and mobile phone, you can practice with these objects first,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 and it's very obvious when the dog takes it hard, the object's going to open,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 and when the dog takes it gently, the object stays together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 So what you're going to do is you're going to click or say yes if the dog takes the object without it cracking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 but if it breaks, you can simply not click, not give a treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 and see if you can encourage your dog to take it in a more calm manner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 I also suggest that you have a different cue for when your dog fetches a ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 So if you throw a ball, you're going to say, get it, which means run and grab it and come running back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=74.0s	74.0	 and you can chew on the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 But if you're fetching something that is delicate, I would use a different cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 There's a little bug in the grass.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 A different cue that means take it gently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 Take it. Lovely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=91.0s	91.0	 Take it. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 Take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 So there it broke, so I'm not going to click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 So if you think giving an Easter egg to your dog, they're just going to grab it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 crunch it up, and swallow the shards of plastic, then don't do this exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=117.0s	117.0	 Take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 Drop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 Take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 Yes, that was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 When your dog is doing really good, you can add distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 Ready, Slash? Go take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 Bring it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 Take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 Go take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=139.0s	139.0	 Put it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 Go take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 Put it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=149.0s	149.0	 Once your dog is an expert at taking these eggs softly, you can also try those cards from banks that you get in the mail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 It's like a fake card to make you want to start an account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 And then if your dog can take these carefully without making holes in them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 then you can start to work on your dog retrieving things that are more valuable to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=170.0s	170.0	 Go take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=176.0s	176.0	 Go take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=179.0s	179.0	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Tiko, go take it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=182.0s	182.0	 Come over here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 If your dog is getting excited by the clicker, you can use a calm marker word instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 I like to use the word good for calmer behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm8LVAeq-lk&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=334&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 Are you ready?
