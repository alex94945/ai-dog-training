https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Question, how do I stop my dog acting like a yo-yo?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=5.9s	5.9	 If you're trapped in the routine of having your dog hit the end of the leash, come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=10.1s	10.1	 to you, hit the end of the leash, come back to you, or hit the end of the leash, go around
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=14.8s	14.8	 you, hit the end of the leash, go around you, your dog is a yo-yo and the behavior is reinforcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=20.8s	20.8	 in itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 That is why it continues to happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=24.2s	24.2	 Even though Splash isn't pulling in this footage, you can see that my behavior of getting the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 dog back with me is actually very reinforcing for dogs such as herding breeds that love
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=33.5s	33.5	 to circle and move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=35.3s	35.3	 For some dogs this technique might work, but for other dogs moving in any direction is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=40.4s	40.4	 highly reinforcing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=41.8s	41.8	 So if you're not making progress, it's time to try another solution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=47.1s	47.1	 Don't feed the dog a treat for coming back to you after pulling, as this could be reinforcing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 pulling as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=53.3s	53.3	 Instead, train the behavior of coming back to you separately in training sessions and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=57.6s	57.6	 not when the dog is pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=59.6s	59.6	 Ask for more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 When your dog gets back to you, ask your dog to make a connection with you, stay longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 with you before moving forward, and offer eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 You can also calmly pet your dog before moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=71.9s	71.9	 You can also train your dog to stop and find heel when you stop, so if the dog pulls, all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=76.2s	76.2	 you have to do is stop to cue your dog to get back with you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 What I'm doing is teaching him before the walk that when I back up, he should come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=91.2s	91.2	 with me, and when I stop, he should stop with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=98.2s	98.2	 You can either do this by luring the puppy backwards with food and click when your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=103.7s	103.7	 gets into the heel position, and continue to click while your dog stays in the heel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=108.0s	108.0	 position.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=116.6s	116.6	 dog back to your side, and click and treat for your dog staying with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 If you've played this game in training sessions, it will be much easier for your dog to offer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 the behavior on a walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 Here you can see me inviting Tug back to the heel position, waiting until he's offering

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 If your dog continues to act like a yo-yo, it could be that you're not stopping for long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=144.5s	144.5	 enough, so practice stopping for longer periods of time and calmly petting your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=150.5s	150.5	 The reward is to get to move forwards again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 Another extremely useful behavior is to teach your dogs to stop when you stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 This is not only a great behavior for walking multiple dogs, but it's a great behavior to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HVYHzLjCqc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=462&pp=iAQB&t=175.2s	175.2	 standing at your side.
