https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Beginnings of teaching a sit or a down stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=3.6s	3.6	 First you need the sit or the down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=5.2s	5.2	 So I'll quickly go over how to teach a sit and how to teach a down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=8.8s	8.8	 And really fast. So if you have questions just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=12.2s	12.2	 write me a text. But
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 to teach a sit, have a treat that your dog is really interested in. If they're, if you're holding it out and they
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=21.0s	21.0	 they wander off, obviously that's not a reinforcer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 So really tiny. I mean this is like almost the size of the head of a pin for my dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=29.2s	29.2	 Just pieces of information.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 They get used to luring them around, pull their head up over their butt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=35.4s	35.4	 If you do it too high, you get a hands, you get a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=38.8s	38.8	 standing up on back legs. If you do it too low, you get a down or some other weird behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 So it's really the human getting the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=48.1s	48.1	 Practice lifting that treat up just over their head. Yes, when they're in the position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=52.6s	52.6	 Yes, yes, treats happen and then okay, all done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=56.4s	56.4	 Whatever cue you want to me and get up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 And if they stay sitting, then okay, yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=62.9s	62.9	 reinforce them for getting up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=70.4s	70.4	 When you're luring a dog, don't give them this treat. They always get another one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=74.4s	74.4	 And only use the lure for maybe the first two or three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=78.8s	78.8	 trials. Next time, just have your hand like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 with a pretend treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=84.3s	84.3	 Lure them into the position. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=88.7s	88.7	 Yes. Yes. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=93.1s	93.1	 So for a down, from a stand, you just push the treat at a diagonal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 Yes. Yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=102.5s	102.5	 Yes. If they get up, oh, you know, if they were to get up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=105.9s	105.9	 all done. No more treats. So the next step is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=109.5s	109.5	 hand signal equals sit. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 Yes. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=117.5s	117.5	 Okay, so you don't want to have a hand signal for sit. You want to have a word to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=121.7s	121.7	 If you say whatever word you want to mean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=125.9s	125.9	 sit before you do the hand signal. So Kika already knows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=129.9s	129.9	 the word sit, so I'm going to use the word pumpkin. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=133.0s	133.0	 I'm going to say pumpkin, move my hand up, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=136.1s	136.1	 Yes. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=138.9s	138.9	 So I'm trying to teach her that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=143.1s	143.1	 pumpkin means sit. Put your butt down on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 Oops, the treat just got out my sleeve. So I'm going to say pumpkin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=151.2s	151.2	 And then move my hand, yes. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=154.7s	154.7	 Okay, all done. Try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 Pumpkin. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=161.4s	161.4	 Yes. And then the key to adding a new cue. Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=164.8s	164.8	 The key to adding a new cue is putting some time in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=167.9s	167.9	 So I'm going to say, Kika, come here. Pumpkin. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=172.3s	172.3	 Wait a couple seconds. They're going to think, what does she want me to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 Every time she said pumpkin, she's done this with her hand afterwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=179.1s	179.1	 Obviously she wants me to sit. Pumpkin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 And I want some eye contact too. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=189.6s	189.6	 Okay. So here are a few little tips. One,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=192.7s	192.7	 get rid of the lor after three trials, otherwise you have a dog dependent on food being in your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=197.1s	197.1	 Two, always remember to release the dog or you'll have an unreliable state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=201.2s	201.2	 Three, the goal is never to have the dog get up. So if they're getting up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=204.3s	204.3	 get better reinforcers or go back a step. Four, vary your rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=208.6s	208.6	 Five, start with no distractions. Six, work on duration, distance, and distraction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 separately before mixing them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=214.8s	214.8	 Seven, make sure the dog's eyes are not focused on the food when you say yes or click,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=219.7s	219.7	 or you build in a behavior of staring at food, which is what people call begging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=223.8s	223.8	 I'll go over this in the next continuing video. So here you see me working on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 distance with Splash. We've already practiced,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=230.2s	230.2	 but when you start, you want to do it in a room with no distraction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=233.1s	233.1	 One step equals a click and a treat, or a yes and a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=237.7s	237.7	 Two steps, yes, treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=241.1s	241.1	 You don't want to keep pushing them further and further. You want to make it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=244.7s	244.7	 variable. So one step, yes, treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 Three steps, yes, treat. Two steps, yes, treat. So they never know whether it's going to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=252.9s	252.9	 harder or easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=254.2s	254.2	 That way they stay excited and interested and having a great time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=258.3s	258.3	 So with Splash, I've worked on moving at different speeds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 You know, try to move as organically as possible. Don't do a robotic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=265.9s	265.9	 one, two, three steps away, turn around. Otherwise, your dog is going to get up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=270.1s	270.1	 if you move normally, or maybe you're carrying groceries, or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 if you're carrying their ball, maybe they're not going to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=277.7s	277.7	 Also, very reward. So maybe they get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=281.9s	281.9	 get released to play with another dog, get to smell a bush,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=285.1s	285.1	 get to play with the toy, get to go out the door, get to have a variable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=289.1s	289.1	 assortment of treats. So not always the same treat, otherwise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 they're going to weigh, hmm, my owner always has kibble
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=297.2s	297.2	 and there's a squirrel over there. Kibble squirrel. Where if your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=301.3s	301.3	 looking at you like a jackpot machine, they don't know if they're going to get the jackpot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=305.3s	305.3	 hit the jackpot on this one. Okay, so keep in mind that the distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=309.3s	309.3	 you can get away from your dog at home is not going to apply at the park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=313.7s	313.7	 So you need to work on distance adding distractions, so at the park you would
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=317.8s	317.8	 start all over again from one step away from your dog, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=321.8s	321.8	 etc. And I will make a continuing video, so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYcs9OAGtY&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=610&pp=iAQB&t=325.9s	325.9	 stay tuned.
