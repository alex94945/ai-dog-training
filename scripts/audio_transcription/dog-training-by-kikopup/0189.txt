https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, this video is on the topic of teaching your little dog or puppy to go inside a carrier or a backpack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=6.8s	6.8	 and then be carried around. This is useful for so many reasons, one of them being that you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 transport your dog safely in the car and at the vet. If you have a little dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 that's worried about being at the vet, you can bring them inside their carrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 This also is great for cats to train them this before they have to go to the vet and then be in a carrier at the vet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 But also for puppies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=31.3s	31.3	 it's a great idea to bring your puppy to the vet in a carrier or a backpack or a baby stroller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 so that they're not in contact with the floor. Of course, you can carry your little dog or puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 but sometimes it's great that the dog can take a nap inside of their crate and turn around and relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=50.1s	50.1	 So if you had to have the dog in a carrier or crate for a very long period of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 it's important that the dog can turn around and lay down comfortably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=60.1s	60.1	 so these options are a little bit too small for Tug, my terrier, even though I'm going to demo with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 They're a great solution for a temporary vet visit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 I bring Tug to the vet in this and then I can unzip the top
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=73.9s	73.9	 so he has this lovely little safe zone where he can take a nap while we're waiting for our vet visit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=79.9s	79.9	 When I was in Japan doing some seminars, my hosts and friends gave me some amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=85.4s	85.4	 gifts, one of them being this amazing backpack, which has been a lifesaver for me because Kiko,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=92.1s	92.1	 my little Chihuahua, is 16 and I like to walk all my dogs together sometimes on hikes and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=98.5s	98.5	 sometimes it's just too much walking for her and this backpack allows me to take her and she can have moments where she walks and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 moments where I carry her without having to hurt my back. And I've just really enjoyed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=112.4s	112.4	 having this backpack in my life. It's made my life so much better, so I'm greatly appreciative for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 If you have a dog that's extremely worried about going inside the crate, even if there are treats in there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=124.4s	124.4	 perhaps the dog had a bad experience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=126.4s	126.4	 you can first teach the dog to go to a bed or a mat and then put the mat inside the crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=132.3s	132.3	 so the dog has a reinforcement history and you have a cue to tell the dog to go to the mat or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=137.9s	137.9	 you can also get one of those crates that you can take the top off of so it's just a base and work with that first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=144.6s	144.6	 Are you ready, Tug?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 So I will link a video in the description below on how to teach your dog to go to a bed or a mat and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=152.7s	152.7	 then relax on it like that. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=158.5s	158.5	 You can also have a release cue for coming out of the crate if you don't want your dog to just come out as soon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=164.3s	164.3	 as you unzip it. Perhaps your dog isn't on leash and you want to put your dog's harness on first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=169.7s	169.7	 So I have the cue free, which means to get up and come towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=174.7s	174.7	 Teaching a dog to go to a mat is also great for training many different types of tricks, including this one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=181.9s	181.9	 If you taught your dog the cue, go to your bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 You can then use the same cue while the bed or the mat is inside the crate. Are you ready? Go to your bed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=189.7s	189.7	 And then you're going to mark and reinforce your dog for simply going into the crate with the mat inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=197.5s	197.5	 I already have a video tutorial of how to teach go in the crate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=201.4s	201.4	 starring Halo, one of my border collies, as a puppy before he knew the cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=206.6s	206.6	 So if you want to see the video with a dog that hasn't been trained yet, it pretty much looks exactly the same
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=212.4s	212.4	 except I go more into detail of the steps of how to get the dog to go in the crate and what to do if things go wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 Are you ready? Tug free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=221.1s	221.1	 So one way of teaching the cue to go into the crate is to throw a treat into the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=228.0s	228.0	 Tug wants to eat it out of my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=230.4s	230.4	 And then as the dog goes in to eat the treat, you can mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=233.9s	233.9	 yes or good or click and then give multiple treats for the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=239.5s	239.5	 staying inside the crate. So the dog might be standing up and you're just giving multiple treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=244.5s	244.5	 and then you can use your release cue free and then invite the dog out of the crate. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=253.3s	253.3	 Anytime the dog offers going into the crate, I would take that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=257.6s	257.6	 and reinforce it. There's some behaviors you don't just want to mark if the dog does on their own, but I find that this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=264.9s	264.9	 marking when the dog offers the behavior is a great idea. Are you ready? Tug free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=269.8s	269.8	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=271.3s	271.3	 Go in your crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=273.2s	273.2	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=276.2s	276.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=277.9s	277.9	 This is Kiko's backpack and she's going to go in like this. Good job, Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=285.4s	285.4	 You can train going in the backpack the same way that you train going inside the crate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=290.3s	290.3	 Good job, Kiko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=291.9s	291.9	 It's handy to have a crate where you can zip the top open like this because then you can reinforce the dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=298.1s	298.1	 for closing the door and it's not as scary for some dogs because they're not completely confined.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=304.5s	304.5	 They can still see you through the top and you can interact with each other through the top while the door is closed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=310.7s	310.7	 And then you can close the top and open the door and then close both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=315.6s	315.6	 So they're getting used to both of the doors being closed. Good job, Tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=319.4s	319.4	 And you wouldn't if you had a dog that's nervous about things moving you wouldn't be doing this to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 Tug is a very confident dog because we've done lots of positive reinforcement training with lots of different distractions like these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=331.9s	331.9	 Okay, so I can feed him through the top but I can start zipping it up. Good. And feeding him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 So every time I zip. Good. He gets a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 So he starts to enjoy the noise of the zipper. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=350.2s	350.2	 Good. And then I can let him out. Tug free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=354.8s	354.8	 He might not want to come out. Tug free. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=358.9s	358.9	 And then if you choose this to go in the game can begin or I can cue him to go back in. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=367.1s	367.1	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=399.8s	399.8	 and you can put them into their carrier next to you on the couch and get them used to being in there for a longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=405.5s	405.5	 duration than just a few seconds and they can get treats or maybe a chew for hanging out in their little carrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=412.6s	412.6	 or taking a nap in their carrier if they're sleepy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 So once you get to the step of them settling nicely inside the carrier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=420.4s	420.4	 and I have a video on how to teach a calm settle around food that I'll also link in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=426.5s	426.5	 but once you get to the point where the dog is just chilling inside the carrier you can practice lifting it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=431.8s	431.8	 So if your dog is standing inside the carrier still I would wait till they're laying down calmly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=437.3s	437.3	 because when you lift them up it might knock them off balance and that doesn't feel good when you're standing up to have the floor move
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=443.8s	443.8	 underneath you. So I have the top open so I could lift him. Good. Then give him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=451.1s	451.1	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=464.3s	464.3	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=481.9s	481.9	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=190&pp=iAQB&t=486.8s	486.8	 before letting the dog out
