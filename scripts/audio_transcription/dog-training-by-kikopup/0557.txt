https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 It's best not to walk a dog just on their collar.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 This is because even if they walk on a loose leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 every once in a while they might lunge forward,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 say perhaps after a squirrel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 and all that pressure is going to go on one tiny point on their neck and their trachea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 Another reason that a collar is a bad idea is that every time your dog hits the end of the leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=26.0s	26.0	 they are actually causing stress hormones to be produced in their body, glucocorticoids,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 and that will actually increase the dog's reactivity and arousal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 making training sessions harder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 Stress hormones are also produced when an owner jerks their dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 If you have a dog that doesn't pull,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 a harness that clips at the back is a perfect idea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 But if you have a strong dog that pulls,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 a back clipping harness is a bad idea because the dog can get extra leverage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 and really hurt your hands when they pull on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 If you have a back clipping harness already,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 you can try clipping the leash to the front o-ring of the harness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 and see if that gives the dog less leverage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 and make it easier for you to train your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 I wouldn't recommend using a head halter on a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=67.0s	67.0	 unless you really believe the dog is going to pull you off your feet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 or pull you places you don't want to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=72.0s	72.0	 This is because it takes a lot of training to get the dog used to the head halter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 it rests on a sensitive area near their eyes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 and you can only give the dog a couple inches of leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 because if they have any more leash,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 they can actually twist their neck and really injure themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 Also, other dogs might find it hard to interpret your dog's body language in a head halter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 Instead, a harness that clips at the front can give you a lot more control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 than having the dog just on the collar or a back clipping harness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_l9C1yT1g&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=558&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Stay tuned for more tutorials on leash walking.
