https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone! Before we get started with this video, I just want to do a quick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=4.4s	4.4	 shout out to one of my number one Kikopup sponsors, Lissette Rossman. Because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 of her and other sponsors, I'm able to create these educational videos on how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=14.9s	14.9	 to train your dogs without the use of physical or psychological intimidation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=19.8s	19.8	 So a big thank you! This video is on the topic of solving the issue of your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=24.7s	24.7	 barking at noises while inside your house by creating a behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=29.1s	29.1	 modification plan. Now if you learn better by reading, I have an article on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=33.9s	33.9	 this exact same topic and I'll link that in the description below. I find it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=38.4s	38.4	 extremely important to work on this issue, especially if your dog is barking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 or worrying or alerting to noises every day of their life while in your house or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=48.9s	48.9	 apartment. This is because your dog doesn't have a place where he feels safe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=53.3s	53.3	 enough that he can get a proper deep sleep without having to worry about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=57.8s	57.8	 what's going on outside. So I believe it's in not only your dog's best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=62.3s	62.3	 interest but also your interest to solve this issue because what can happen is if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=67.3s	67.3	 your dog is constantly not getting enough sleep because he's worrying about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=70.7s	70.7	 noises outside or reacting to noises outside, he's gonna start having other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 behavioral issues such as a lot of dogs actually react to dogs and people in the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=81.2s	81.2	 street more. So a lot of people might hire a trainer and they're working on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=86.5s	86.5	 their dog not barking at people or dogs while outside on a walk but then every
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=91.4s	91.4	 day when the dog gets left and the owner goes to work, the dog is then barking at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 people and dogs that they hear when they're outside so the training can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=99.5s	99.5	 seem like it's going nowhere. So before you even try to address the dog reacting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=105.1s	105.1	 when out on a walk, you really have to get to the root of the problem which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=108.9s	108.9	 the dog is reacting while inside of your house. This is my behavior modification
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=114.3s	114.3	 plan. Number one is preventing the dog from hearing the noises in between
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=118.8s	118.8	 training sessions as much as possible. Number two is setting up training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 sessions where you can teach your dog to be calm and relaxed in the presence of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 the noises and number three is training in real life. I'm gonna go over each of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=132.3s	132.3	 these. The first step is using prevention, preventing your dog rehearsing the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 behavior of reacting to the noises in between training sessions. Now if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 live in a small apartment that's pretty noisy it can be hard to get rid of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=146.5s	146.5	 noises completely but trying your best to reduce the noises can be helpful. For
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=152.6s	152.6	 example, if your dog is left in a quiet room those noises upstairs might be more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=158.3s	158.3	 intense than if there's music playing and white noise machines. So some of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=163.4s	163.4	 things that I like to do with my clients dogs and also with my own dogs that have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=168.3s	168.3	 past had a problem with this is use a white noise machine, a fan and when the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=173.9s	173.9	 dog is left alone leaving the dog in the least noisiest place in the apartment or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=179.4s	179.4	 house. So for some houses and apartments the least noisiest place might actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=185.5s	185.5	 be the center of the living room so you can create a pen with a crate and a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 radio next to the pen so that the dog is not hearing the noises from the windows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=196.4s	196.4	 First you would need to train the dog to be okay with being left in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=200.5s	200.5	 situation but it can create a dog that is much calmer when being left alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=205.9s	205.9	 because they're not being bombarded by all these noises from outside. Now if you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=210.7s	210.7	 live in an apartment or a house where the noises come from one direction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=214.7s	214.7	 perhaps the street then I suggest keeping the dog in the room furthest from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=219.4s	219.4	 that place where the street and the noises outside are coming from. So if
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 there's a front door in a hallway and there's a back bedroom that might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=228.5s	228.5	 actually be the best place to leave the dog. Now it's important that whenever you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=232.7s	232.7	 leave a dog you train them first to be left in this situation because that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=237.9s	237.9	 could also add to the dog stress if they're suddenly left in a new situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 they might react even more to the noises. If your dog is only barking at noises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=246.7s	246.7	 when you're not home it could be due to the fact that your dog feels uncomfortable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=250.7s	250.7	 being left at home alone and that that is the big piece of the puzzle that you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=254.9s	254.9	 need to be working on which is teaching your dog to feel comfortable and relaxed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=259.0s	259.0	 when home alone. I suggest the best plan of action is teaching the dog to want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=264.2s	264.2	 sleep when you're not in the house and to promote your dog sleeping when you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=268.7s	268.7	 gone. It's a great idea to set up training sessions where you leave your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=272.3s	272.3	 dog while you're home in the setup that you'll be leaving your dog when you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=276.5s	276.5	 not home and working on the dog relaxing on his dog bed when left in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=281.3s	281.3	 this situation. I'll link a video in the description below of how to teach your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=285.7s	285.7	 dog to go to the bed and also how to teach your dog to settle. The next step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=290.5s	290.5	 is setting up training sessions to teach your dog to be calm and relaxed when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=294.8s	294.8	 hearing these noises. Now most dogs are so sensitized to the actual noises that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=300.1s	300.1	 when they hear the actual noise they're so aroused that they can't help but bark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=304.6s	304.6	 and they might not even want to take treats so it's important to break the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=308.4s	308.4	 training up into small achievable steps so your dog is calm every step of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=313.1s	313.1	 way. One way to do this is to write the list of all the noises that your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=317.3s	317.3	 reacts to. If you're not sure what the noises are you can just take a guess and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=323.2s	323.2	 create noises that happen outside the house and work on them and as you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=328.3s	328.3	 working on them you might find that your dog is getting excited by those noises
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=332.4s	332.4	 and that tells you that they're probably the noises that your dog reacts to. So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=337.0s	337.0	 some examples of noises to work on are the sound of footsteps, running, shuffling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=343.8s	343.8	 feet, people's voices, the sound of jingling dog collars, the sound of jingling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=349.4s	349.4	 keys, the other the sound of dogs barking or panting or pulling on leash where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=354.3s	354.3	 they're kind of gagging like that. That's a big trigger for some dogs. The sound of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=359.8s	359.8	 cars, the sound of motorbikes, the sound of a bicycle or skateboards outside and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=366.6s	366.6	 the sound of the neighbors thudding around in the apartments, the sound of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=372.3s	372.3	 doorknobs if you live in an apartment where people are going in and out of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=376.2s	376.2	 doors or the elevator noise. So one thing you can do is record the sounds outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=382.0s	382.0	 with your phone or your computer and then play them back inside at a very low
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=387.3s	387.3	 volume. The other idea is if you have keys or jingly collars you can reproduce
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=393.2s	393.2	 the sound inside. So what you're doing is you're conditioning the dog to find the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 sound means nothing. So for example if you use keys you jingle your key then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=405.4s	405.4	 feed a treat and it's extremely important to do it inside your home where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=409.3s	409.3	 your dog can see where the sound is coming from. So if you've recorded
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=413.1s	413.1	 something or you're playing back a video where there's a jingly key you play the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=417.6s	417.6	 video feed a treat where your dog sees that you're holding the equipment that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=422.0s	422.0	 making the sound to reduce the startle because if your dog doesn't know where
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=426.5s	426.5	 the sound is coming from he most likely will bark. If your dog gets excited by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=432.3s	432.3	 the sound of knocking I have a video on breaking the steps up small enough and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=437.2s	437.2	 I'll link that in the description below but basically you're sitting in front of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=441.6s	441.6	 your dog you knock and then give them a treat knock and then give them a treat

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=451.4s	451.4	 when you knock on your own furniture and they can see you doing it. I'm gonna

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1165.8s	1165.8	 but of course accidents do happen or you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1169.3s	1169.3	 Make your training go too quickly and the dog might react to one of the noises that you're using in a training setup or perhaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1176.3s	1176.3	 Every day life your dog hears the noise through the white noise machine or when you have the white noise machine off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1182.4s	1182.4	 And what should you do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1184.2s	1184.2	 I think it's extremely important to not ignore the dog when they're barking because barking can be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1190.0s	1190.0	 Self-reinforcing and they might bark for the rest of their lives if you just ignore them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1193.7s	1193.7	 So for me, it's important to interrupt the behavior and redirect the dog to a behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1199.7s	1199.7	 You would like the dog to be doing so some of the ways that you interrupt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1204.4s	1204.4	 Undesirable behavior work really well. I have a video on how to interrupt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1209.3s	1209.3	 Undesirable behavior and I'll link that in in the description below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1213.2s	1213.2	 But a couple of ways are using cues that you've trained with positive reinforcement like a recall
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1220.7s	1220.7	 So if your dog has an extremely strong recall, you can call your dog as they start barking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1226.3s	1226.3	 another one is the leave it cue and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1228.9s	1228.9	 The cue to go to your bed if you've just started training one of these like believe it or the go to your bed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1235.6s	1235.6	 I don't suggest trying to use them to interrupt barking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1239.6s	1239.6	 It's better to use cues that are extremely strong that you've trained in at least 12 training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1246.3s	1246.3	 Where the dog has got a conditioned emotional response to the cue and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1251.9s	1251.9	 The response to want to listen to you if you try to use cues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1256.4s	1256.4	 You've just trained when your dog is barking most likely they won't even hear you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1261.6s	1261.6	 one more time, sorry

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1297.0s	1297.0	 Not to bark at noises. The best method is by reinforcing the behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1301.8s	1301.8	 You do want your dog to do when he hears the noise initially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1305.5s	1305.5	 Which is to be calm and relaxed and the best way to do this is by setting up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1310.1s	1310.1	 In the future when you've resolved the issue of your dog barking at noises outside the house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1315.4s	1315.4	 I still find it extremely important that if you hear an extra loud noise or a new noise or one that you haven't heard in a very long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1323.4s	1323.4	 That you give your dog positive feedback when hearing the noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1327.0s	1327.0	 Instead of just sitting silently and wondering what will happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1330.6s	1330.6	 I suggest as you hear the noise you turn to your dog you show them calm and relaxed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1336.3s	1336.3	 As you hear the noise you turn to your dog you show them calming signals you blink at them you smile in a calm relaxed manner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1344.5s	1344.5	 You can even sigh and tell your dog how good he is when hearing the noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1350.2s	1350.2	 This will let your dog know that you hear the noise and that it's not an issue for him to worry about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1356.1s	1356.1	 It's just one of those training games if you keep really quiet and pretend like you haven't heard the noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1361.5s	1361.5	 I find that doesn't help the dog out as much and they can regress to their previous behavior of barking at whatever noise it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1373.2s	1373.2	 Kiko, my Chihuahua, started to have a habit of barking at the door when anyone came in the house including me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1384.6s	1384.6	 At first she just barked at the door a couple of times and then suddenly she started sensitizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1390.7s	1390.7	 So even the sound of my telephone ringing if someone was coming over me knocking on a piece of furniture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1396.9s	1396.9	 Or the door opening and closing would send her into a mad frenzy of barking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1404.1s	1404.1	 Another terrible thing that was happening is that once Kiko started barking my other little dog would join in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1411.0s	1411.0	 Kiko is a very friendly dog but because she was going on this downward spiral even the word hello
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1417.3s	1417.3	 spoken by someone she really liked sent her over her threshold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1425.1s	1425.1	 Go say hi Kiko
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1429.9s	1429.9	 Hello hello hello hello hello hello go say hi Kiko

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1444.2s	1444.2	 When training a dog the last thing you want your dog to do is exhibit the behaviors you're trying to get rid of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1450.4s	1450.4	 This is because every time the dog rehearses undesirable behaviors it makes your dog more likely to regress to those behaviors in the future
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1459.4s	1459.4	 This is why in all of my videos I prevent the dogs from doing the undesired behaviors by setting them up for success
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1467.1s	1467.1	 However in this video I did allow my Chihuahua to bark even though it was detrimental to the training process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1474.3s	1474.3	 In the hope that it would encourage people to train their own dogs without the use of physical or psychological intimidation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1482.9s	1482.9	 The game plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1485.3s	1485.3	 One write a list of triggers or in other words the things that make your dog bark at the door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1490.7s	1490.7	 Two use counter conditioning with each trigger separately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1494.4s	1494.4	 Three add the triggers together one at a time once your dog has started to look happy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1500.1s	1500.1	 relaxed and expectant of a treat for each trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1503.9s	1503.9	 Four prevent your dog from seeing or hearing the triggers outside of training sessions until you have finished your training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1512.8s	1512.8	 So here's the list of Kiko's triggers that we're going to go over in this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1518.0s	1518.0	 If you're uncertain as to what your dog's triggers are you can simply break apart the scenario
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1523.4s	1523.4	 Into tiny pieces that you will condition one step at a time for example knocking on the door the door opening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1531.6s	1531.6	 and a person entering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1534.2s	1534.2	 The knocking trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1536.3s	1536.3	 To use counter conditioning you simply have to create the trigger which in this case is knocking and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1544.1s	1544.1	 Follow it up with a high value reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1548.0s	1548.0	 The most important thing to remember is that the trigger should predict the reinforcement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1553.5s	1553.5	 So you want to make sure that you give the treat after the dog hears or sees the trigger rather than at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1560.6s	1560.6	 To set my dog up for success i'm knocking in areas that aren't related to the front door before I move on to knocking on the front door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1577.4s	1577.4	 The doorbell trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1579.0s	1579.0	 If you want to set your dog up for success you can record the sound of the doorbell and play it at a lower volume
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1584.9s	1584.9	 At first you can also take your dog outside and ring your own doorbell while your dog sees that there are no guests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1591.2s	1591.2	 But a lot of dogs will actually still bark even though they see that no one is there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1601.6s	1601.6	 The phone call trigger

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1608.2s	1608.2	 You simply have to let the phone ring and then feed a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1611.8s	1611.8	 You can also change the ringtone on your phone until your dog is done with the training process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1617.6s	1617.6	 The door handle trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1619.4s	1619.4	 To set my dog up for success

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1628.4s	1628.4	 If you see that your dog is getting stressed or overexcited by the training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1632.5s	1632.5	 Simply stop the training session and start again when your dog is relaxed and keep the sessions shorter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1638.4s	1638.4	 The door opening trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1640.4s	1640.4	 Open the door and then feed your dog a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1642.4s	1642.4	 If you think your dog is going to go through the door you can have your dog on a leash and a harness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1660.4s	1660.4	 The verbal greetings trigger

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1667.2s	1667.2	 I like to over exaggerate my excitement so that when someone does come over it's less exciting than in the training sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=202&pp=iAQB&t=1675.2s	1675.2	 Hi
