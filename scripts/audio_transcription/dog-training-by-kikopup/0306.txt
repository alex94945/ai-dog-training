https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, it's that time of year again where they start to sell pool noodles at the store.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=4.3s	4.3	 They usually cost between one or two dollars and they're really awesome for training different tricks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=8.9s	8.9	 One reason I like them is that they're soft so that the dog can't get hurt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 Now one trick that I like to use them for is teaching the trick jump through the arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=17.4s	17.4	 So your arms are in a circle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 In the end your arms are going to be in a circle like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 but to get there you can approximate with a large hoop for the dog to jump through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=28.5s	28.5	 If the dog hits the hoop you can just let go of the hoop so your dog doesn't hurt themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=34.3s	34.3	 But once your dog can jump through a hoop this size,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 you can start to scoot your hands down and make the hoop smaller and smaller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 until your dog can jump all the way through your arms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 Now take care because if you look through the hoop you can really hurt yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=48.8s	48.8	 So watch my video on teaching your dog to jump through your arms in a hoop first before trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=54.4s	54.4	 Are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 Jump through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=65.5s	65.5	 You can be as inventive as you want to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=67.5s	67.5	 Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=68.5s	68.5	 Spiral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=70.5s	70.5	 Spiral.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 Go hoop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=88.5s	88.5	 Get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rO9LJZia4&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=307&pp=iAQB&t=89.5s	89.5	 Good girl.
