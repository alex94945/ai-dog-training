https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everyone! It's extremely important to work on handling and grooming exercises in the first few weeks that you get your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 Here are some helpful behaviors to work on to aid with handling and grooming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 Take treats nicely. Default leave it from treat container.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 Sit, stand and settle calmly. Go to a mat or platform.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 Targeting behaviors such as the chin rest and paw targeting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 Eye contact and relationship building exercises like the attention game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 Check out the video description below for links to video tutorials on how to train these.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 We can teach puppies what to do when being petted, handled and groomed by setting up short training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 You can use a portion of your puppy's breakfast and dinner to work on handling exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 And I suggest working on them daily when you first get your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 First we'll go over four steps for teaching your puppy to be calm and confident when being handled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 And then we'll cover the steps for teaching grooming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 Handling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 Step one. Touch and feed a treat at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 The reason that you want to feed and touch at the same time is that if you have a madly puppy and you just reach for your puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 your puppy might either lick or bite at your hand as you're reaching for your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 Or if you have a timid puppy, you reach for your puppy and your puppy might back away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 And that's not the first thing you want your puppy to do when you reach for them in a training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 So I suggest starting out every training session by feeding and touching at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 So if you're going to be touching your puppy's feet, you touch and feed at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 Practice touching the top of the head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 And you're doing this all calmly so the puppy isn't finding it overwhelming at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 So now I'm touching on the back of his shoulders like this and feeding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 And then once you've done that and your puppy is seeming pretty contented to get his treat while you touch him at the same time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=122.0s	122.0	 you can move on to the next step, which is making the petting the predictor of food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 Because at the first step, you're simply teaching him what's going to happen to him while he's not doing anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=134.0s	134.0	 And then the second step is teaching him that the actual petting is what predicts that the food is going to come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 Step two, touch your puppy, say good or click, and then move to feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 So I'm going to touch him, say good, and then give him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 Once your puppy is calm and relaxed with you placing your hand on your puppy, you can also practice stroking gestures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 Step three, add duration to the handling and teach the puppy to ignore the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 The third step you might not actually get to in the first few training sessions because it requires a couple of other skills to be taught to the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 One, either that the puppy can look away from treats that you're holding, like that, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 Or that your puppy can offer you eye contact or at least look up at you when you make a kissy noise or an attention noise, good, like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 And I did not know that he would do all that so perfectly. You're so clever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=218.0s	218.0	 Okay, so after doing step two where you reach, mark, good, and then feed, you can start to wait until your puppy offers you eye contact or doesn't look at the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 Because you don't want your puppy to only think that handling is okay if he's looking at food because when the food becomes out of the picture, then suddenly you might get the mouthing, inviting, or over excitement with handling again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=242.0s	242.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 So you reach, touch your puppy calmly, and wait for your puppy to stop looking at the food or look up at your eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=251.0s	251.0	 And if that doesn't happen within two to three seconds, you can make your attention noise or say your puppy's name if that's his cue to look at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 Now, when I make my attention noise and my puppy doesn't look, I make a little blowing noise, like a breathing noise, like that, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 And then I mark it and then go to feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 You want to make sure when you mark your puppy for calm behaviors like handling that you don't race to get that treat into the picture because what you can create is a puppy that's getting excited about the treat coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=286.0s	286.0	 So you want to mark, pause, and then feed the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 Step four, keep changing the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 Practice these handling exercises while the puppy is sitting, standing, laying down, as well as while you're standing above the puppy or to the side of the puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 It's really important that during this training you handle your puppy calmly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=309.0s	309.0	 However, you should do some training sessions where you simulate what other people might do to your puppy before you can tell the person that that's not an appropriate way to pet a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=323.0s	323.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=328.0s	328.0	 If your puppy opens his mouth, gets excited, leans away or backs away, go back to step one where you touch and feed at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=336.0s	336.0	 If your puppy is still too excited, then stop training and wait until another time to train when he is calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=344.0s	344.0	 Here you can see my puppy ducks when I try to touch him on the head, so I go back to step one of touching and feeding at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 If you have a puppy that leans away or backs away from you when you try to touch him, you can play this game as the first step,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=359.0s	359.0	 where you move away from your puppy and to reach the treat, the puppy's face rubs against your hand to get the treat in your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 So you can hold your hand under his chin as he reaches for the treat or have your hand above his head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 Then you can turn it into a petting gesture and start to pet him before you give him the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=382.0s	382.0	 Start training your puppy to be calm and confident with grooming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=387.0s	387.0	 I've had my puppy here for two weeks and we've worked on handling where I reach, touch and feed him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=395.0s	395.0	 So first I started off with touching and feeding him at the same time just to make sure that he didn't pull away or bite me or mouth at my clothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 And then I started to reach, mark, good, and then feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=410.0s	410.0	 So I reached and touched him all over his body. You can also look inside their ears, look inside their mouth, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=419.0s	419.0	 Touch their feet, good. And then touch and hold their feet, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=424.0s	424.0	 If the puppy pulls away, you simply don't mark, he's not going to do it now, you simply just don't mark and make it easier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=433.0s	433.0	 perhaps just laying your hand on their feet like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=436.0s	436.0	 And did you see how he nibbled on my hand a little bit? I can then go back a step and touch and feed him at the same time like that. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 Step one, condition a positive emotional response to the tools using training games that don't involve grooming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=453.0s	453.0	 Grooming Tool Recall Game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=456.0s	456.0	 The game is very simple. You simply pick up the equipment and then move away from your dog, mark and reinforce your dog for moving towards the equipment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=464.0s	464.0	 So you're basically playing a keep away game with the equipment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=468.0s	468.0	 If you're using equipment that makes noise such as a nail trimmer or a dremel, you can drop a treat for your dog and then move 15 feet or 20 feet away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=477.0s	477.0	 and then make the noise of the tool in a very soft manner before then encouraging your puppy or dog to come to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=484.0s	484.0	 So you might click the nail clippers very gently as the dog is further at a distance and he's just finished his treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=490.0s	490.0	 and then you're going to say pop, pop, pop, pop and then mark and reinforce for the dog moving towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=495.0s	495.0	 You don't want to make the noise as the dog gets to you at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=499.0s	499.0	 You want to make the noise while the dog is at a distance and you're moving away from the dog as you make the noise and then encouraging your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=511.0s	511.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=513.0s	513.0	 Woohoo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=517.0s	517.0	 Once your dog is responding happily with a positive emotional response to the noise at a low level and can move straight at you excitedly expecting his treat without any reservation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=528.0s	528.0	 you can start increasing the level of the noise as well as the duration of how long the noise is going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=534.0s	534.0	 So if you have the dremel, you can start to have the dremel go for a longer period of time before the dog reaches you to get his treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=542.0s	542.0	 and then you can also have the dremel at a louder or more intense volume.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=547.0s	547.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=558.0s	558.0	 Good job, pupsies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=563.0s	563.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=566.0s	566.0	 Play training games where the tools are present.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=570.0s	570.0	 Here I am working with Wish, the border collie puppy, working on some of her tricks while I hold the grooming tools in my hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=581.0s	581.0	 Now we're playing a game of tug and drop while the dremel is on and making noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=586.0s	586.0	 Oh yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=593.0s	593.0	 Target. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=595.0s	595.0	 It's a great idea to continue incorporating the grooming tools in fun training sessions even when your puppy is all grown up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=603.0s	603.0	 especially if you notice your dog is starting to look worried when you pick up the tools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=609.0s	609.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=611.0s	611.0	 Step two, practice the handling that will be necessary during the grooming before incorporating the tools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=619.0s	619.0	 It's a great idea to incorporate teaching your dog to offer their paws for grooming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=624.0s	624.0	 However, I also like to teach the dogs to be calm and confident when having their paws manipulated by me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=630.0s	630.0	 so I can also do massage and stretching as well as physical therapy with my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=636.0s	636.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=641.0s	641.0	 Paw pups. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=645.0s	645.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=647.0s	647.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=662.0s	662.0	 The first step is taking the paw and feeding at the same time, then putting the paw down and stopping feeding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=674.0s	674.0	 Good job, pupsie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=677.0s	677.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=685.0s	685.0	 Step three, touch with the grooming tool and feed at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=689.0s	689.0	 If I were just to go and touch him with the brush, he might turn around and try to bite the brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=694.0s	694.0	 So at first when you start brushing your puppy, you're going to feed them a treat and touch them with the brush at the same time, gently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=701.0s	701.0	 If the movement of the tool is exciting your puppy, you can first work on the movement before then moving the tool while touching your puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=712.0s	712.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=714.0s	714.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=716.0s	716.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=719.0s	719.0	 Step four, touch your puppy with the tool, say good or click, and then move to feed a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=726.0s	726.0	 Here Lisette is teaching her golden doodle puppy Lucy to be calm and confident with her grooming tools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=735.0s	735.0	 After touching Lucy with the back of the clippers while they were turned on, she then went back a step to make it easier for Lucy by simply just letting Lucy listen to the sound of the clippers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=748.0s	748.0	 Using a comfortable dog bed is also a great idea for introducing the grooming tools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=756.0s	756.0	 If you use a tool that makes noise, practice without the noise first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=762.0s	762.0	 If you're using a clicker with your puppy and the clicker is not very loud or muffled, you can practice reaching and touching the feet with the clicker, clicking as you touch the feet and then feeding a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=775.0s	775.0	 This can help get the puppy used to a noise happening near his feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=779.0s	779.0	 If the puppy looks uncomfortable, go back to simply touching and feeding at the same time or easy handling exercises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=793.0s	793.0	 And I'm going to go and I'm going to touch his foot with the nail trimmer and he pulled his foot away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=798.0s	798.0	 So now what I can do is simply touch his foot and feed at the same time with this nail trimmer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=804.0s	804.0	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=806.0s	806.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=810.0s	810.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=813.0s	813.0	 Step four, increase difficulty and duration in small approximations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=819.0s	819.0	 It can be helpful to add eye contact to some grooming behaviors at first to teach the puppy the concept of ignoring what's happening to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=828.0s	828.0	 Make your attention noise after touching the puppy with the grooming equipment so the grooming equipment becomes the cue to pay attention to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=839.0s	839.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=842.0s	842.0	 Because Halo is in a very relaxed mood, I can increase the duration of brushing and do multiple brushes before giving him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=852.0s	852.0	 When doing something new, like brushing faster or brushing when the puppy is standing, you can go back to feeding the treat at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=859.0s	859.0	 It's extremely helpful to have someone else feeding your dog a treat as you cut a tiny piece of the nail off for the first time or use the dremel on the nail for the very first time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=869.0s	869.0	 But it is possible to do on your own. I like to have my puppy on my lap for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=874.0s	874.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=877.0s	877.0	 Here is footage of Lucy at five months old getting a haircut. As you can see, she's very calm and relaxed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=884.0s	884.0	 Teaching a dog to trust you during handling and grooming takes time and effort, but by taking the time to train in the first few months you get your puppy, you'll be setting your relationship up for success for a lifetime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=897.0s	897.0	 I honestly believe you save time training in the long run when being proactive with behavior management, as you don't have to backtrack and problem solve as much down the line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=910.0s	910.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=915.0s	915.0	 Check to see if your puppy is a willing participant by moving away from him or tossing a treat further away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=923.0s	923.0	 If he is reluctant to move toward you after eating the treat, it means you need to change your training plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=930.0s	930.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=934.0s	934.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=936.0s	936.0	 Good. Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=944.0s	944.0	 Good. Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=952.0s	952.0	 Good. Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=956.0s	956.0	 Step five. Keep changing the picture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=959.0s	959.0	 Dogs can sometimes feel physical discomfort during grooming or veterinary care. For example, if hair gets pulled, a nail bed is sore, the dog gets pushed off balance, the dog has pain in his body, or a needle is used.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=973.0s	973.0	 A technique I learned from Ken Ramirez is to vary the training that is involved for procedures that can be uncomfortable for the animal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=981.0s	981.0	 You can do this by teaching a puppy that something novel will happen during the grooming and handling procedures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=987.0s	987.0	 To do this, practice stroking, scratching, brushing, gentle poking, and on the rare occasion giving a rabies shot or having to use a thermometer, rather than simply repeating something that is physically uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1002.0s	1002.0	 Varying what you do will make it less likely for setbacks when something unexpected happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1008.0s	1008.0	 Here are some signs that the learner might be feeling conflicted or uncomfortable with the handling or grooming training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1016.0s	1016.0	 Turning the head away or looking away with the eyes, holding the ears lower or back, licking the lips, ducking or lowering the body, withdrawing the paw, backing away, putting the tail lower, tension in the body, or arching the back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1035.0s	1035.0	 Don't panic if you see your dog offering these signs as you raise criteria, as sometimes they are unavoidable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1042.0s	1042.0	 The signs are just information to the trainer to break the steps up smaller or add variety to the training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1049.0s	1049.0	 For example, if the dog's toes are repeatedly being restrained in the training session, it can cause the dog to find it an unpleasant experience even when getting a treat every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1060.0s	1060.0	 So instead, you can sometimes ask for a high five, as well as sometimes just stroke the paw, sometimes lift it up and down again, and only one out of five to ten times restrain and hold the paw during the training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1074.0s	1074.0	 Here you can see Wish is cooperating by giving me her paw, but her left ear turns back and she looks to the left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1089.0s	1089.0	 This tells me that she's not completely comfortable with what I'm doing, so instead of breaking it up into small approximations, I'm going to make it easier for her, but I'm also going to ask for random other behaviours that she finds really easy to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1103.0s	1103.0	 So I'm going to ask her to sit pretty while playing the Dremel, toss a treat away to see if she comes back and is in the game, ask for paw targeting, and now she's offering her left paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1116.0s	1116.0	 What to do if you need to groom your puppy before the training is complete.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1122.0s	1122.0	 If the puppy needs to be groomed before the training is complete, choose a moment when the puppy is calm and let the puppy chew on a high value chew as you work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1132.0s	1132.0	 This is easier if you have a helper. It might be necessary to only do a portion of the grooming at a time, for example one or two nails or brush just one part of the puppy to keep the puppy from having a negative experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=188&pp=iAQB&t=1146.0s	1146.0	 I hope you enjoyed this video. If you'd like to support my work, don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe to my channel.
