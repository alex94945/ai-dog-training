https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 This exercise is not only a great safety exercise, but it's a great way to teach your dog concepts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 Safety first. This behavior is not a substitute for offense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=17.0s	17.0	 Leaving a dog unattended could leave your dog in danger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 Not only could your dog become spooked and run away into traffic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 but people and other dogs could enter into your dog's space and cause harm to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=28.0s	28.0	 You would never leave your expensive laptop out in an unfenced yard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 and so you should never leave your companion to be injured, lost, or stolen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 The first step is to be 100% safe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 Have your dog in a harness and attach their long line to something secure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 If you're near a busy road, make sure that the dog can't get into the road where they can get hurt.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 Set the dog up to be 100% right every time at the start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=55.0s	55.0	 Break the barrier up into small sections that you work on one piece at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 Encourage your dog to move around in the space you've selected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=66.0s	66.0	 Click and reinforce inside the space.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 You will be teaching your dog that he can move freely within the space designated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 Try not to click your dog for standing still, sitting, or laying down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=80.0s	80.0	 or your dog could start thinking it's about staying in one position and not within the barrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 If you're working somewhere where there's long grass and your dog can't find the treats that you've thrown,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 you can simply run back to your dog and feed your dog behind the barrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 The advantage of throwing the treats is that you don't have to keep running back and forth to give the dog the treat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=106.0s	106.0	 and you can reinforce your dog for being far away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 Now it's time to raise criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 There are many ways to raise criteria, but first we'll start with distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 So I'm going to get further away from the dog and reinforce the dog for staying behind the barrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 If you raise criteria too quickly and your dog comes over the barrier, there are many things you can do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 You can either wait and see if your dog offers to go back behind the barrier, you can point, you can give your dog a cue,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 you can tell them to back up, or you could lure your dog back behind the barrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 The first five times that your dog comes over the barrier, you can reinforce them for thinking to go back behind the barrier again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 but if you keep doing this, it'll become a habit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 So if your dog comes over the barrier after five times, encourage your dog back behind the barrier,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=162.0s	162.0	 but wait for something better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 Raise criteria and see if your dog can stay behind the barrier before clicking and reinforcing them again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 Here are some exercises to do to prove the behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=174.0s	174.0	 Walk back and forth in front of the dog, near and far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=177.0s	177.0	 Walk through the area and then out, stopping it first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 Run through the area and out and do some random movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 Practice from each side of the barrier as though it were a new behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=190.0s	190.0	 Here you can see we're working on the concept that if something the dog wants leaves the area that the dog's supposed to stay in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 the dog should stay behind and not follow the thing that they want to get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 To do this, you click and feed your dog as you leave the barrier before the dog has a chance to leave the barrier himself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=208.0s	208.0	 and then you wait the dog out and see if the dog will stay as you move forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=213.0s	213.0	 If your dog does follow you over the barrier, simply encourage your dog back quickly and then try again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 but this time make it easier for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=224.0s	224.0	 Here you can see I'm making it easier for Trish by stopping, reinforcing, and then moving forwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 The next time, I'm going to wait to see if she thinks to stop before clicking and coming back to reinforce her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 This is Trish's first lesson of barrier training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 As you can see, dogs are highly intelligent and can understand common sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=255.0s	255.0	 This is just the beginning of the training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 You want your dog to stay behind the barrier with high level distractions as well as low level distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=267.0s	267.0	 Here you can see Trish's first lesson of barrier training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 As you can see, dogs are highly intelligent and can understand complex concepts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBm_x_gBqKg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=453&pp=iAQB&t=285.0s	285.0	 Thank you for watching!
