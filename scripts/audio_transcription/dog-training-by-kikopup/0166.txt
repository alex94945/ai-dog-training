https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hi everybody, this is just a quick video for troubleshooting when teaching drop toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=6.7s	6.7	 So here is my little puppy epic and she's really food motivated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=12.2s	12.2	 So when I have food out, she doesn't want to play with the toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=15.5s	15.5	 She wants to eat the treats and if you're working on drop with food and you're tugging with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=20.9s	20.9	 And then you present a treat then the dog can sometimes not want to play tug anymore and want to eat the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=27.7s	27.7	 So actually right at this moment, she's realized there's some more treats up on that counter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 But before I started playing tug with her over here, I have some treats on that counter back there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 So what I'm gonna do is get her invested in playing tug again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=44.2s	44.2	 And then the moment that she's tugging I can mark her good and then go and get a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=51.1s	51.1	 from this cup and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 Then I'm gonna show her I have no more treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=57.4s	57.4	 All done and then I'm gonna get her to play with the toy again and it might take some time to get her invested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 in playing with the toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=65.9s	65.9	 Rather than going off and checking where she might get treats from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=70.3s	70.3	 Because what she's saying to me is actually I prefer treats right now to tugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 But if you go through this training what you're gonna do is get the dog to want to work for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 I'm gonna move over so you can see if she goes over to the cup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=85.7s	85.7	 But what you're gonna do is you're gonna get the dog to want to work for you for the things you have and what they're learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=91.7s	91.7	 Is that the things they want it's in their best interest to do what you want them to do to get what they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=98.3s	98.3	 So here she's tugging again. I can say good and then I can go and get the treat from the cup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=103.5s	103.5	 So
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=106.7s	106.7	 Drop it and tugging are kind of like yin and yang if you work too much on tugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=112.5s	112.5	 It's hard and you need to work more on teaching the dog to drop if the dog is really good at tugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=118.6s	118.6	 But if the dog is really good at dropping for a treat you have to reinforce tugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=123.9s	123.9	 So that's why when she comes back and gets reengaged in the toys that I'm playing with over here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=130.3s	130.3	 That's when I'm gonna mark so I want to make sure she's engaged and she doesn't just come over and as I mark runs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=136.1s	136.1	 Off I want to make sure she's playing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 with this toy nicely before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=141.4s	141.4	 Before I mark it good and now I'm gonna go get the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=147.0s	147.0	 Good job epic good job, and now I'm gonna say all done sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=151.4s	151.4	 I have nothing so that she doesn't feel confused that she has to do something like perhaps sitting in order to earn the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=159.4s	159.4	 And I'm gonna play with the toys again if I wasn't sure that she might not get the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=164.8s	164.8	 I'm not gonna say get it because what can happen is you say get it get it get it and the dog is standing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=170.5s	170.5	 Looking around for how they can get the treat off the shelf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=173.9s	173.9	 You might even have to keep the treat in another room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=176.6s	176.6	 So you go to the kitchen give the dog a treat come back and play the game and your dog might be sitting there in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 the kitchen and it might take a while to get the dog invested back in the toys and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 Then as soon as they're invested good and then go to get the treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=195.0s	195.0	 Awesome and now I'm gonna move closer to where the treats are kept and see if I can get her back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=202.4s	202.4	 Interested in tugging on the toy good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=208.5s	208.5	 That was very good epic now even closer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=212.8s	212.8	 Whoo-hoo-hoo good epic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 Sure I have nothing and then make the toy come alive again good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 Awesome job, I'm gonna just zoom in a little bit so you can see what I'm doing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=236.9s	236.9	 Hi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=237.9s	237.9	 Now she's looking over to see the cup and hoping that she could do something in order to get the treats out of the cup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=243.7s	243.7	 But I'm gonna play with the toy again and as soon as she's invested in that toy good. I'm gonna mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=250.3s	250.3	 And reinforce good job ready
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=254.3s	254.3	 Get it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=256.3s	256.3	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=258.3s	258.3	 Good girl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 Good girl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=262.3s	262.3	 Get it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=265.3s	265.3	 Good girl. Oh, yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=275.1s	275.1	 Drop good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=277.9s	277.9	 Once your dog is reliably letting go when you say good to get the treat you can instead start to say drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=284.3s	284.3	 So I'm gonna play with her with this toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=295.3s	295.3	 Oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=299.7s	299.7	 Drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=301.7s	301.7	 Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=304.8s	304.8	 In your training you might not get to the point where you need to start adding the cue drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 To have your dog let it let go of the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=311.9s	311.9	 You simply need to say good and move towards the treats and let go of the toy because most likely the dogs gonna drop the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=318.7s	318.7	 In order to go and get the treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=321.5s	321.5	 But in a couple of training sessions you then might be able to add the cue drop where once the dog is engaged in tugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=327.9s	327.9	 And she's not that interested in tugging right now because the treats are there so I shouldn't really be working on this with her good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=335.5s	335.5	 But once the dog is engaged in tugging get it get it get it you then say the cue
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=343.8s	343.8	 Then say the cue drop good and then say good and go get a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=348.9s	348.9	 I'm sure her I don't have any more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=351.9s	351.9	 Awesome, and then get the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=354.3s	354.3	 The next step which I'm not sure if epic is ready for yet is then having the treats in your bait bag or in a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=361.0s	361.0	 Container that your dog already knows to leave in order to do behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=365.0s	365.0	 So I have these treats in a cup over here, and I'm gonna try and get her interested in the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=370.7s	370.7	 I can show her all done that I don't have any treats in my hand like I was doing earlier with the cup and then I'm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=377.2s	377.2	 Wiggle the toy around and see if I might get just a tiny bit of interest in going for the toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=384.0s	384.0	 So this type of game is too hard to begin with because as you can see you get a half-hearted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=391.4s	391.4	 Interest in the toy because the dog is telling you I want these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=394.8s	394.8	 But after some training if you break the steps up small enough with having the treats far away and move towards the treats in small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=402.2s	402.2	 Approximations you're gonna keep that interest in playing with the toy so at some point. She's gonna good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=408.6s	408.6	 She's gonna go for the toy, and then I'm gonna feed her a treat, so she's not ready for this step just yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=414.2s	414.2	 I'm gonna continue to play with her where the treats are further away and really build that interest in yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=419.7s	419.7	 I can totally play with the toy with you even though the foods the foods there on the shelf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=424.2s	424.2	 But as you can see here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=425.5s	425.5	 It was much harder for her in between the training sessions where you're teaching your dog to tug even though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=430.9s	430.9	 There's food around and teaching drop using the treat you can simply play tug with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=435.4s	435.4	 And then just let go when the game's over and let the dog enjoy the toy if it's appropriate for the dog to have a toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=442.2s	442.2	 Like that you can also play a game with two toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=445.0s	445.0	 It's better if you have two toys that are exactly the same as the dog might have a preference for another one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=451.1s	451.1	 But it's a game that a lot of dog trainers play when they don't want to teach drop using food and to play the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=458.5s	458.5	 There are different ways of playing it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=460.1s	460.1	 but a very simple way is that you move one toy and get the dog invested in it and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=464.9s	464.9	 You can move the toy back and forth gently like this so that the dog doesn't readjust their grip so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=470.7s	470.7	 And we haven't really worked on tugging so much because she's been losing her teeth. So I've been avoiding tugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=478.2s	478.2	 So that she doesn't have discomfort while we're playing tug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=481.1s	481.1	 But here she's gripping it better and then I'm gonna hold it still and to get her to change to the next toy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPsdEDuQwg&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=167&pp=iAQB&t=487.4s	487.4	 I'm gonna wiggle the other toy around like this until she's engaged in it and when the dog starts to drop it reliably
