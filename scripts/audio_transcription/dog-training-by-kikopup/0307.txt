https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everybody, today I'm going to show you a cute canine freestyle move that's especially fun to do with little dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=7.0s	7.0	 To teach this trick, your dog already needs to know his sit's day as well as to use his left paw and his right paw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 I have two videos on how to train those behaviors and I'll link them in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 So you're going to warm up by cueing your dog to sit's day and practice proofing the sit's day and then when your dog is staying nicely you can then start to ask for his different paws while in the sit position in the normal way that you usually have been doing it before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=52.0s	52.0	 Once you've warmed up you can take your shoes off and practice doing the same behaviors while holding your shoes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 So you're going to take your shoes off and practice doing the same behaviors while holding your shoes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 If your dog gets it wrong you simply need to hold the shoe further to the right or the left so your dog can be correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 So I'm going to say bye and he's going to hit it with that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=71.0s	71.0	 Wave, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=75.0s	75.0	 Ready? Wave, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=79.0s	79.0	 Awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Wave and bye.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 Wave and bye. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 If you're going to do this trick with your dog behind you, you can hold the shoes upside down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 Are you ready? Wave, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 Wave, good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=109.0s	109.0	 Bye, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 When you first stand up the picture is going to be a little bit different for your dog so you want to make it easier by asking for one paw movement per treat as you did in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=120.0s	120.0	 Are you ready? Wave, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=125.0s	125.0	 If your dog's not getting it at first you can sit on a chair and get the behavior first before standing all the way up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=131.0s	131.0	 Ready? Can you do wave? Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=135.0s	135.0	 You might even hold your own shoes. Bye, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 Wave, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 Oh, you got it. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 When you first start training this trick with your dog behind you I suggest holding onto something stable like a chair so you can look over your shoulder to see if your dog is actually touching his feet on your feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 Now, if you feel unstable without the chair you can simply incorporate it into your trick routine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 If you're going to do this trick with your dog behind you, your dog's going to have a pretty good sit-stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 So you're going to cue your dog to sit, wait, and then you can either turn in front of them, so take a nice little turn as they wait there before then doing the behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8MKVrr1Ks&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=308&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 or you can cue your dog to go between your legs, then go between, cue them to sit, wait, and then you take a step forward, wait, as they stay there, and then begin the trick.
