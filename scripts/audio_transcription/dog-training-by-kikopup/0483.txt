https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJiapWYOHRA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=484&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 Click or say yes and make sure you spend enough time playing with your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJiapWYOHRA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=484&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 so that it becomes highly reinforcing to run towards you.
