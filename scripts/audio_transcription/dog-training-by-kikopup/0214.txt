https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Here's a quick way to teach your young puppy to play fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=3.9s	3.9	 Now this is a very useful skill to teach a young puppy because if they steal your socks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=8.3s	8.3	 or something like that for example, you can get your puppy to fetch it to you and drop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=13.6s	13.6	 First you get your puppy interested in the toy, then you throw it and when you see your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=17.1s	17.1	 puppy has the toy in their mouth, you make a kissy noise or go pop pop pop pop and go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=21.4s	21.4	 the other way and most young puppies will forget to let go of the toy when they go towards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=26.7s	26.7	 you so they'll carry the toy towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 And if you have two toys, you can then play with the puppy with the other toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 Wait until the puppy has the toy in his mouth before making enticing noises or moving away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=37.7s	37.7	 from your puppy to entice him to move towards you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=43.1s	43.1	 When your puppy gets to you, you can gently play tug with your puppy and then drop the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=47.4s	47.4	 toy and show your puppy the other toy and move it around until your puppy drops the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=52.4s	52.4	 toy he has in his mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=54.9s	54.9	 You might want to use a bigger or longer toy than I'm using here if you think your puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=59.3s	59.3	 might go for your hands while you're jiggling the toy around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=69.8s	69.8	 Puppies shouldn't really play fetch until they are adults and their growth plates have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=73.5s	73.5	 closed because of the jolting movement that happens when the dog gets to the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 Fetch also needs to be limited in adult dogs to prevent injury.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 That said, I like to train fetch to young puppies as one of the first behaviors that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 they learn while they still have the tendency to want to hold onto the toy in their mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 when they're called.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=93.2s	93.2	 I suggest throwing the toy three to five times to teach the concept in a couple of training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=98.8s	98.8	 sessions and then when the puppy is great at fetching, you can then play games that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 don't involve jumping or jolting movements, for example, teaching the puppy to put his
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=108.1s	108.1	 toys away or having the puppy chase you with a toy in his mouth to then play tug with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=118.5s	118.5	 Professional dog trainers and performers who have injury prevention and the health of their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=122.5s	122.5	 dog in mind always choose to train and perform and play with their dogs on a non-slip surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=129.1s	129.1	 This is because if you work on a slippery surface, it's like when you're on ice and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=133.6s	133.6	 you slip a little bit, that happens to dogs and it's really hard to avoid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=138.4s	138.4	 So the best solution is yes, train your dog to be confident when they walk on slippery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=143.8s	143.8	 surfaces but when you play and train with your dogs, train and play on a non-slip surface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=150.2s	150.2	 like a carpet or grass outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=153.4s	153.4	 Some carpets and mats are actually slippery so you need to check and make sure you don't
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=157.7s	157.7	 just have a carpet that's slippery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=160.1s	160.1	 You want to make sure your dog's not slipping when they're moving around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 It's also really important with adult dogs when you're working on jumping and jolting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=168.0s	168.0	 movements like agility and stuff like that, you want to be working on a padded surface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=173.5s	173.5	 like some dog training arenas have a padded mat that the dogs perform and train on or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 grass is the best surface for doing jumping movements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 I don't suggest having your dog jumping in the house high on a carpet like this because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=189.7s	189.7	 there's just not enough padding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=192.2s	192.2	 Conversely sand is also not a good thing to perform jumping and jolting movements because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=197.7s	197.7	 it's too giving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=199.3s	199.3	 So I suggest investing in a training surface for your puppy or adult dog if you're not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 going to be doing jumping tricks and stuff like that and working on stuff inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=210.5s	210.5	 I like to have an area rug like this for my puppy training and yes it's harder to clean
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 with a puppy but you can get a cheap one and then just throw it away and get another one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 It's also really important for my puppy here because he likes to play a lot in the evening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=228.5s	228.5	 and this is the space for him to play in and he won't go and venture onto the hardwood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 floor to play with his toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooRRioC-cTE&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=215&pp=iAQB&t=235.8s	235.8	 He sticks to the carpet because it's non-slip and that's really going to help him grow properly
