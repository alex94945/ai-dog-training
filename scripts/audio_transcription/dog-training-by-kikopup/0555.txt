https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=3.0s	3.0	 This is a tutorial on how to paint an awesome painting of your pet without having any background in art.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 Supplies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=11.0s	11.0	 What you'll need to complete this project is a canvas, a printout of your pet, a dark graphite pencil, acrylic paints and paint brushes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 Step 1. Choose an image and prepare the background.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=24.0s	24.0	 Print out your image on your computer and make sure that the image fits to the canvas that you're going to be using.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 For our project we're using Kiko and Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=34.0s	34.0	 Now you want to prepare the canvas. If you just paint onto a canvas, the paint doesn't go on very smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 So you want to do two layers of paint.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 Lay the paint down and then paint little rows of Xs while the paint is still wet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 The point of this is to get rid of any blobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=51.0s	51.0	 You can use the blow dryer to dry your painting faster. You want it dry to touch before you do your next layer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 Now to mix the colors for the background.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=60.0s	60.0	 We both made a background of three basic colors using yellow, burnt sienna, orange and white and a tiny bit of blue to tone down the color.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 The lighter color was achieved by adding more white and the darker color by adding more blue and brown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 Here we are blending the colors together while the paint is still wet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 This same technique was used in the background of Kiko's painting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 Except this time the lighter color was applied in a diagonal line across the painting and the colors are a little brighter because more yellow was added.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 Make sure the backgrounds are completely dry before you go to the next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 Step 2. Transfer your image to the canvas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=102.0s	102.0	 If you have absolutely no skill with drawing you can create a transfer by coloring in the back of your image with a graphite pencil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=112.0s	112.0	 Something like H6 or higher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=115.0s	115.0	 Once you've done that take some paper and wipe it down so there aren't little grits of graphite on your canvas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 Then tape your image onto the canvas where you want it to appear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=126.0s	126.0	 Now take a pen and outline your image.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 For my image of Splash I want it to be like a paint by number so I'm drawing a line around different areas of color.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 Keep in mind the lighter your background the easier it will be to see the graphite lines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 Step 3. Get painting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 For Kiko's portrait my friend is outlining Kiko and painting in the basic colors of Kiko's body before he goes back and fills in the detail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 He's mixing blue and red to make purple, adding some white and filling in the form of Kiko with the purple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 You want to do two layers of paint for your dog's body so that the background color doesn't show through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=172.0s	172.0	 You can either use the same color twice or a different color.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=175.0s	175.0	 Wait till it's dry or blow dry your painting then put the stencil back on top to fill in all the details.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 For Kiko's painting there aren't going to be any lines it's just going to be blocks of color.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=187.0s	187.0	 This is the easier of the two methods if you have problems painting fine lines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 Here he's mixing burnt umber, burnt sienna and white to create a Kiko color.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 To make the inside of the ear color, alizarin crimson, burnt sienna and white make a very good color.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 You can add more white for highlights and blue for shading if you were to get that obsessive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 Once you've painted in all the sections you can add as much or as little detail as you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=220.0s	220.0	 As you can see having the under layer show through makes the image look less flat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 Back to Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 For Splash's portrait we're using a different method.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 Paint over all the graphite lines with one color.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 You don't want to use black because black can be too dark and too dominating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=239.0s	239.0	 So I'm using a mixture of ultramarine blue, burnt sienna and white.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 You can be as creative as you want. You can use hot pink for your outline if you wish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 You can also fill in all the colored areas with any color that you wish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=252.0s	252.0	 But for my portrait I'm going to fill in all the white areas of Splash's coat with a mixture of white and ultramarine blue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 I'm using a mixture of blue, brown and white to make the gray areas on Splash's coat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=265.0s	265.0	 For her different colored eyes I'm using light blue and light brown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=269.0s	269.0	 For the black areas I'm going to use a darker mixture of the blue and the brown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 The tongue is similar to the ear. Alizarin crimson and white with a tiny bit of brown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=279.0s	279.0	 If your background looks dull you can add a little bit of flair with a wash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=284.0s	284.0	 Basically you just add a lot of water to a paint and then you can rub it on with either a sponge or as I'm using here a piece of paper towel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=294.0s	294.0	 As a final touch I added a little hint of white on the highlighted areas of Splash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=299.0s	299.0	 Kiko found this very exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=302.0s	302.0	 And here's the final result. The two portraits done in two different styles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=307.0s	307.0	 Okay YouTubers, I'd like you to post a video response of the painting that you do using this tutorial along with the photo that you used or footage of the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=317.0s	317.0	 I want to see how many people actually were able to follow this technique.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=321.0s	321.0	 And if you were then I might post videos on how to do other artistic things regarding your pets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=327.0s	327.0	 See you next time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 Extras. A good starting palette to have is cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, alizarin crimson, cadmium orange, titanium white, cadmium yellow, yellow oxide, burnt umber and burnt sienna.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 Another good color is cadmium red for mixing other colors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31N_gmUkE0&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=556&pp=iAQB&t=352.0s	352.0	 If you have a dog that's all one color outline the highlights, the middle tones, and the dark tones and use those three colors to fill in your outline or block painting.
