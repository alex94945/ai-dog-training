https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=7.7s	7.7	 Now a lot of you might know that in the past
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=10.8s	10.8	 circuses used lots of different methods that weren't so nice to train some very amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 multi dog tricks as well as other animal acts and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=20.5s	20.5	 these days a lot of people want to do training with their dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=23.6s	23.6	 but they want it to be a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=25.6s	25.6	 two-sided relationship where the dogs are also having a good time as well as the owner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=30.4s	30.4	 Firstly, I want to mention that if your dogs are uncomfortable with each other in any sort of way or you're just not sure what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=36.2s	36.2	 might happen if you train your dogs at the same time or in the same room,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=40.4s	40.4	 it's important to go and hire a professional trainer who doesn't use any forms of physical or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 psychological intimidation to train your dogs and then you can follow along the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=50.5s	50.5	 tutorial with the help of the trainer because the trainer can help you notice if your dogs are showing any signs of discomfort along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 Step one teach each dog a calm settle around food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=63.5s	63.5	 The first step is teaching each dog separately one at a time a calm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=68.4s	68.4	 settle for food like this one and I'll link a video in the description on how to train this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=74.5s	74.5	 Step two teach take turns for treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=78.2s	78.2	 The second step is teaching the dogs to take turns taking treats and I'll link a video below of how to train this but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=84.9s	84.9	 basically you're teaching the dog that when you have a treat and it moves towards one dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=89.5s	89.5	 it means it's not for the other dogs and this can greatly reduce frustration when working on multi dog tricks because most likely until now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 you've been working with the dogs one-on-one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=100.2s	100.2	 So when they see a treat moving they naturally think that it's for them and what you'll have if you hold a treat out is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=106.5s	106.5	 whole bunch of dog faces right on the treat and that can cause frustration for everyone involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=113.3s	113.3	 Step three teach take turns for training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=116.8s	116.8	 The third step is teaching the dogs to take turns during training sessions as you might have seen in some of my videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=123.3s	123.3	 when I'm working one dog all the other dogs are relaxing on the couch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=127.2s	127.2	 So by teaching this first you're actually teaching your dog that if they don't get a treat fast enough when working with another dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=134.9s	134.9	 they won't feel stressed over aroused or punished by it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=138.5s	138.5	 So you can work with this dog a little bit and that dog isn't going to be like hey, where's my treat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=144.0s	144.0	 So that's why I like to train that first before then working with the dogs together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=148.4s	148.4	 and I have a full tutorial on how to train that and I'll also link that in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=153.8s	153.8	 Step four teach and proof behaviors before adding dogs together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 The fourth step is teaching and proofing the behaviors that you're going to be using in the multi dog trick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 separately with each dog until they're nice and strong before adding dogs together and then when you do add the dogs together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 you can make criteria extremely easy so that when the dogs are added together they think suddenly things become much easier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=178.2s	178.2	 and working with other dogs means more treats and more fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=182.5s	182.5	 So she can walk around on my feet like this for a long duration of time and she finds it really fun and easy because we worked on this trick a lot and it's a strong behavior now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=190.5s	190.5	 I've also trained and proofed a very strong leg weave behavior with my terrier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=195.5s	195.5	 Tug go legs go legs go legs go legs good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=201.0s	201.0	 For a trick where you might want one dog to circle around another dog that's in a stationary position like a sit or a sit pretty position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=209.7s	209.7	 you could work with a prop add a really good verbal cue for the dog and then build that behavior to be really strong and you could even proof for different situations before then adding a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=219.7s	219.7	 Step five teach the dogs the concept of working together by first asking for behaviors near each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=226.5s	226.5	 If you're going to be using luring to train your multi dog trick it's important to teach the dogs the concept that you're lowering two different dogs at the same time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=236.4s	236.4	 so I'm going to do that with Halo and Kiko over here so it's easier at first when one dog is in a settle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=242.4s	242.4	 so Halo is focused on this treat being his and Kiko is focused on this treat being hers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=248.3s	248.3	 so I'm going to lure Kiko around in a circle like this good and then both of these dogs are going to get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=254.8s	254.8	 Practice luring both dogs at the same time and drastically reduce criteria so they're just following the lure for like a second before you mark and reinforce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=263.0s	263.0	 ready splash halo good ready good good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=272.5s	272.5	 you can then practice having one dog do a behavior while the other dog waits so I'm holding my hand out like this for halo and then I'm going to lure splash in a circle like that good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=284.8s	284.8	 and now I'm going to hold this treat for splash to sit and have halo go in a circle good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=293.3s	293.3	 ready good splash sit good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=303.2s	303.2	 and you can turn those into hand signals so I have no treats and I can have this hand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=308.0s	308.0	 cueing splash to sit and this hand queuing halo to move sit splash twirl good sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=315.6s	315.6	 sit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 ready good sit down stand sit splash twirl and sit halo twirl and sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 Most dogs are accustomed to working directly in front of the trainer so you can utilize a target like a mat or a platform to teach your dogs to stay the appropriate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=345.5s	345.5	 distance away from each other when working in a group. A lot of dogs find it punishing or stressful when another dog moves in close proximity to them while they're training so here you can see I'm conditioning a positive emotional response in halo to the movement of the other dog while he's working for food so I'm getting splash to move in front of him and marking the moment splash moves and giving both dogs a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=371.3s	371.3	 It might seem like I'm being overly careful when training my dogs but the end result is dogs that are happy to work with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=382.6s	382.6	 Ready tug go legs tug go legs tug go legs good good job
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=392.3s	392.3	 go circle good go around good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=400.6s	400.6	 good ready go circle good go around good splash the pretty halo go circle halo go around good getting good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=418.8s	418.8	 Step six drastically reduce criteria when working with multiple dogs and pay attention to the dog's body language to see if the dog is showing any signs of stress or discomfort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=428.7s	428.7	 and adjust your training plan accordingly. If you're not a professional trainer who studied canine body language and stress signals you should not work with your dogs in too close proximity or work on tricks where the dogs touch each other because what can happen is things can look great to an untrained eye but what's happening is over time the dogs are starting to have an aversion to doing the trick and at some point because you're not helping them out they might have to tell the other dog off for touching them or they just don't feel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=458.7s	458.7	 comfortable touching the dog that's giving them these warning signs to go away so what I suggest is hiring a trainer to help you with training the tricks and assessing if the dogs are okay doing the tricks together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=471.5s	471.5	 Tug go round so as you can see for tug this behavior is really easy for him and he can do it multiple times so when I add another dog into the picture I'm just going to have him go around one time or even a tiny bit of a circle around the other dog before I mark and reinforce and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=488.7s	488.7	 he'll start to see that when working with another dog things become extremely reinforcing and fun. So now when I add the dogs together I'm going to use an extremely high rate of reinforcement and I might revert back to blatant luring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=503.2s	503.2	 Tug get it good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=508.0s	508.0	 Tug get it good. Tug get it good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=512.4s	512.4	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=514.0s	514.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=515.2s	515.2	 So I'll hold the treat here for Wish and hold the treat down here for Tug so that he learns to weave through her legs. Tug go legs good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=525.2s	525.2	 Tug go legs good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=536.2s	536.2	 Here are some signs of stress or feeling conflicted. All dogs are different and they will exhibit different signs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=545.6s	545.6	 Ears move back, gaze shifts, body leans away from other dog, licks lips not after eating a treat but during the behavior, yawns, dog lifts a paw, dog begins panting after no exercise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=561.4s	561.4	 tension in the body, submissive behaviors, frustration related behaviors, or the dog simply refuses to do the behavior or offers an incorrect behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=572.8s	572.8	 Don't panic if you see your dog lick his lips because dogs do lick their lips when they're eating treats. So if you notice it happens after a treat, don't worry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=583.1s	583.1	 Also when working on a new multi-dog trick, a dog might offer a glance away or lick his lips to be polite to the other dog so it's not the end of the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=592.5s	592.5	 It just means you need to go back and make both dogs feel comfortable with that exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=598.0s	598.0	 To review, here are the steps in order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=601.2s	601.2	 Step one, teach each dog a calm settle around food. Step two, teach take turns for treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=608.9s	608.9	 Step three, teach take turns for training. Step four, teach and improve behaviors before adding dogs together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFkeC6PIl2c&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=226&pp=iAQB&t=616.8s	616.8	 Step five, teach the dogs the concept of working together by first asking for behaviors near each other.
