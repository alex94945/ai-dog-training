https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=4.4s	4.4	 Training Skills seminar. When using positive reinforcement, in many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=8.3s	8.3	 circumstances you need to use a marker to mark desirable behavior that you wish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=13.3s	13.3	 to see happen in the future. Now after you mark that behavior, if you want to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=17.2s	17.2	 see it happen again in the future, you need to follow that up with reinforcement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=20.8s	20.8	 Now once a marker has been followed with reinforcement multiple times, the marker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 itself, say for example the sound of a clicker or the word yes, starts to create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=31.8s	31.8	 a conditioned emotional response in the dog. So after hearing the sound of the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=36.2s	36.2	 marker, the dog will feel a certain emotion which is usually some type of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=40.4s	40.4	 happy emotion. Now you can use these markers and how they create emotions to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=45.9s	45.9	 your advantage or to your disadvantage by mistake. So what do I mean by this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 Well, I like to create markers that are only used in calm scenarios that create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 a conditioned response of feeling good but not feeling over aroused and markers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=63.7s	63.7	 that I use in exciting situations that make the dog very excited. Now you might
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=69.2s	69.2	 wonder why you would want to do this, but say for example you love agility but you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=74.3s	74.3	 also have a reactive dog and you don't want your dog to get as excited about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=79.9s	79.9	 seeing other dogs and not barking as you would like your dog to be about running
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 the agility course. So I would say use a marker where you're trying to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=89.3s	89.3	 build excitement and arousal, use a marker for that specific training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=94.7s	94.7	 scenario but don't use that same marker when you're trying to get your dog to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=98.8s	98.8	 calm. Watch my terrier's body language after hearing a calm marker which is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 usually associated with a calm treat delivery versus a marker associated with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=108.8s	108.8	 an excitable treat delivery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=369&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 Yes!
