https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=4.0s	4.0	 That just simply means that you're teaching the puppy the click means that a treat is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 You can do it while you're training behaviors, but it's always a good idea just to make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=13.0s	13.0	 that the puppy is responding to the clicker and understanding that food is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=17.4s	17.4	 coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=18.6s	18.6	 So I like to use multiple markers when training a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=22.3s	22.3	 So I like to use the word, good, said calmly, and then a slow treat delivery like this for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=28.7s	28.7	 calm behaviors like a settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=31.3s	31.3	 And that's what we've been working on already with this little pup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=35.1s	35.1	 I've had the puppy a couple of days and I have not yet started working with the clicker

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 I've just been working on calm behaviors around food like the settle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 What you need to do is click, pause, and then feed your puppy a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=48.9s	48.9	 You don't want to click and feed at the same time like this because the puppy might not

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 to mean that the food is coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=59.7s	59.7	 So you're going to wait till the puppy is finished eating the pieces of treats that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=64.0s	64.0	 he just got.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=65.9s	65.9	 And then when you see your puppy look up, click and feed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=79.9s	79.9	 Good boy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 over the dimple.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=144.4s	144.4	 With young puppies or new rescue dogs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADVfF7bgU8&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=197&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 If the puppy is biting or licking at your hand, stop and lure from further away or
