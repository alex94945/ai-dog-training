https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpLv6T8caXU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=473&pp=iAQB&t=70.0s	70.0	 Here's a trick I use to speed up the training process when you need a behavior very quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpLv6T8caXU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=473&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 First, use luring to get the behavior about 10 times and then sit back and see if the dog can offer the behavior you just lured.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpLv6T8caXU&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=473&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 Remember to click the dog for the motion of crawling under the object.
