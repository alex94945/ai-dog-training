https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Okay, so I want to show you what I do with my dogs to get them excited about nail clipping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=8.0s	8.0	 Okay, so to begin getting your dogs excited about nail clipping, show them the object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=14.0s	14.0	 They see that they get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=16.0s	16.0	 Not so much targeting them, but they see that they get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=19.0s	19.0	 A click and a treat, or a yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 They see the object, and they get a click and a treat, or a yes and a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=27.0s	27.0	 Here's the object, click and treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 Look at this wonderful thing, yay!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=31.0s	31.0	 You've got a crowd of dogs wanting some nail clipping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 As my friend Kate says, there is no rule that you have to clip all your dog's nails at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 So, to begin with, first, you know, if your dog's never had their nails clipped or sanded or dremeled,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 put the thing near their nail, they get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 Put the thing near their nail, they get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=57.0s	57.0	 Yep, treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 Yep, treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 The next step, so you want to do that a couple weeks with your dog if they've never had it done before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=76.0s	76.0	 practice grabbing their feet, squeezing their toes, and they get a click or a yep and a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=84.0s	84.0	 Grab their feet, squeeze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 Now, with my dogs, I like to have them upside down to do their nails because I think it's way, way more easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 So, if you want to do that, you know, just turn them on their side, equals a click and a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=101.0s	101.0	 Turn them on their side, click, treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 You don't want to push them too far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=107.0s	107.0	 So, if you think your dog hates being upside down, don't, mix the two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=110.0s	110.0	 But if you've done handling where your dog knows to be upside down, click, treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=119.0s	119.0	 One at a time. So, maybe the first week you just turn the dog upside down, grab the foot, click, treat, and have the tools out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=128.0s	128.0	 Grab the foot, click, treat, have the tools out, feed in position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 And then, eventually, if you want to use a Dremel, you want to condition them to like you've done previously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 The two different speeds. Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=155.0s	155.0	 The next thing is, yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=164.0s	164.0	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=165.0s	165.0	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=180.0s	180.0	 Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 And you'll have a dog that eventually, you can sand their nails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=188.0s	188.0	 Borrow their nails with a Dremel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=192.0s	192.0	 Yay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=196.0s	196.0	 Woo hoo hoo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 And they're contented just to lay there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=203.0s	203.0	 And the back feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 Woo hoo. What a good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 Back feet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 Kiko doesn't like the Dremel so much because she only ever met it recently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 Treats for laying there. Maybe filing the nails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 Filing the nails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 Yay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 She didn't like the filing as much as the clipping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 Yay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=240.0s	240.0	 Do do do. Yep. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 And if at any point they start to struggle, like for instance, I'm really clipping and she starts to struggle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=250.0s	250.0	 don't go so far. So get her foot back but make it a little, you know, pretend clip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=257.0s	257.0	 So for Kiko she doesn't like the Dremel. She can put up with it but she doesn't like it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 So I'm going to turn it on. Yep. She gets a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=266.0s	266.0	 And obviously if they're scared to death of the thing, you want it in the other room, it turns on. Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=271.0s	271.0	 It equals a treat. But she's pretty, she's okay with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oeOUZ8kls&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=612&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 That's all I'm going to do with you.
