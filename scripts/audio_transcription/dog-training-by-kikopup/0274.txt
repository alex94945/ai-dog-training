https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Hey everyone, today I'm going to show you how you can teach an extremely important concept
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=4.5s	4.5	 to your dog that is oftentimes overlooked in dog training classes and that is to teach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=9.0s	9.0	 your dog to want to do what you ask of your dog even if you don't have any treats, toys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=15.0s	15.0	 or anything the dog wants on your person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=17.8s	17.8	 Now without prior training most dogs won't listen unless they know you have something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=22.9s	22.9	 good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=23.9s	23.9	 There are some dogs that will listen but if you have a dog that doesn't listen when you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=28.1s	28.1	 don't have treats this is the tutorial for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=31.3s	31.3	 It's a very simple game to begin with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 You simply need to have a plate with some low value treats on it like this kibble and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 then you need to have your dog in a leash and harness and put the treats out of reach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=42.9s	42.9	 of your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 Now some dogs if you ask them to do a behavior for you they're most likely not going to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=48.7s	48.7	 it because they want the treats on that plate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=51.7s	51.7	 So I suggest going back to basics and using a higher value treat to lure your dog so you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=57.1s	57.1	 can ask for any behavior you want but choose your dog's strongest behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=61.3s	61.3	 So for a lot of dogs that's a sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=63.4s	63.4	 So I'm going to say sit and then I'm going to lure my dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 If it's difficult for my dog I'm going to click and treat or say yes and treat and then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=71.2s	71.2	 I'm going to give her a release cue to go and get the treats off the plate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=74.7s	74.7	 So I'm going to say okay go get it and point towards the plate and let her enjoy those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=79.7s	79.7	 treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=82.7s	82.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 Now if your dog can't listen to you you can use lower value treats on the plate or create
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=90.3s	90.3	 distance so maybe you're 10 or 15 feet away from the plate when you lure your dog into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 the sit before releasing them to the plate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=97.7s	97.7	 So at first to make it very simple you're going to put the treats on the plate and you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=101.6s	101.6	 can get a helper to help you if you can't do that yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=105.1s	105.1	 You're going to ask your dog for a behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 Free.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=109.8s	109.8	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 When your dog is getting more advanced you're going to ask your dog to sit, not click, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 then release your dog to the treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=124.3s	124.3	 So are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=125.3s	125.3	 Okay, go get it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=133.7s	133.7	 value treats on the plate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 and how quickly they can progress through all the steps but the final step is that you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 we've worked on this with Splash.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=218.2s	218.2	 treats are on a plate and not on your person, you can start to use the environment for this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=223.9s	223.9	 game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&list=UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ&index=275&pp=iAQB&t=228.1s	228.1	 You're not going to say, okay, get it, but you're going to say, okay, go say hi.
