https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Bree and I are training our totally untrained puppy from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=3.8s	3.8	 And as we're making our way to Alaska, we find ourselves in the amazing state of Wyoming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=9.4s	9.4	 When I'm training a dog, I'm constantly considering the short, the medium, and the long-term training plan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 For example, I could tell you in a single sentence how to train a dog. I mean, seriously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 Just supervise them, spend 20 minutes to an hour a day working with them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 love them, and train them in various environments often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=26.6s	26.6	 But this series has focused on documenting how I train a puppy on a daily basis over a longer period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=33.1s	33.1	 In fact, it's probably the most detailed dog training that we could ever produce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 But you know what's really helpful sometimes? Having a clear plan and a 30-day overview in order to jumpstart your training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=43.6s	43.6	 whether you've got a brand new puppy or even an older dog. And that is why we designed 30-day perfect pup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 It's a crash course that Bree and I made together that shows how to get your training under control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 by stopping things like puppy biting and jumping and how to train your dog to walk nicely on a leash and stay and come and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 If you take that course and you watch these videos, you'll know exactly how I train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=67.5s	67.5	 It's not hard and it's totally free. You get access forever and you can take it at your own pace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=73.4s	73.4	 I'm going to have a link in the description where you guys can sign up for 30-day perfect pup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=77.9s	77.9	 In all of our training with Veronica on this road trip, I've been sure to give Inertia plenty of quality time with us as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 We're in this beautiful location in Sinks Canyon in Wyoming looking at the beautiful rocks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 This is an interest of ours. We love seeing what the earth is made of, but it's also a good opportunity for Inertia to explore and see things and smell things and touch things that no other dog has touched before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 Though maybe a Triceratops has. Okay, come on, let's look around. Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=102.6s	102.6	 This is about as alien an environment as I've trained in. So I think it's pretty cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=107.2s	107.2	 There are a lot of distractions here for Inertia, lots of ungulate poop on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=111.0s	111.0	 But even getting her to try to heal in this environment is going to be really interesting because you have to adjust the way that you walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=116.0s	116.0	 So let's see, heal. Good. Good. I'll go slow here. I got to make sure I don't trip over anything. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 See, let's see if she can heal over this rock. Good. Good. Yes. Hey, pretty good effort, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=138.3s	138.3	 I mean, I've never had her do anything like that before where she stayed with me up such a substantial obstacle, I guess. Heal. Good girl. Come on here. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=149.3s	149.3	 And yes, that was perfect. I love it. Even just a basic heal exercise like this, she's really having to use her brain in a different way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=158.9s	158.9	 She's having to use her body in a different way. This just gives her that additional life experience to be able to move, take direction and be able to work on the fly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=167.0s	167.0	 When she's living with humans here, we're just trying to do a heal in a circle. Heal. Good girl. Come on. Keep going. Good. I'll take that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 I don't mind her coming off the rock there. Good girl. I got to be careful not to fall. That's perfect. I'll take that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=183.3s	183.3	 I like doing tricks and obedience and different form factors like this in different places just to really broaden her horizons and help her think differently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 Lie down. Good. Put your head down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=195.8s	195.8	 Okay, that was close. That was close. Here. Lie down. Put your head down. Stay. That's what I had in mind there. Yes. Okay. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=205.5s	205.5	 I mean, you know, it's visually dynamic. It's interesting. It's fun for both of us. So pretty. Stay. Yes. Come. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 You know, periodically, I like to make sure she understands stay. I'm going to combine distance and briefly even go out of sight to make sure that inertia understands stay even in this rather odd configuration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=229.2s	229.2	 Lie down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=234.2s	234.2	 Okay, heal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 Yes. Good job. But my burning question is in Sinks Canyon, can inertia come when called? I mean, there's so much beauty to look at. How could anything pay attention in an environment like this? Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=254.0s	254.0	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 Heal. Yes. I'm so proud of her. Yes. Lie down. Very good. Stand. Speak. Yes. All right. Fine. I knew she would do all this behind my house. I knew she would do this and lots of other places we've been. But until you do it, you just don't know. So that's a progress report on inertia's basic obedience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=280.4s	280.4	 And one of the many tasks we're working on over the next many months is refining Veronica's frisbee game. I want to see how she's doing on all of the components, you know, chasing it, picking it up, bringing it back in a straight line, letting go and eagerly awaiting the next throw. I'm first one to assess her mood. Is she in the mood to play? She seems pretty in the mood to play. All right, so she chased it. She's bringing it back. I'm going to tug with her. But then she just doesn't know what to do. So she's just going to go back and wait for the next throw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=310.4s	310.4	 Does she willingly let go? Let go. We need some work there. That's clear. I'm just gonna make it boring. Yes. Good. I got lucky there. Good. She seems to really love to chase it. She very quickly learned how to do a take. Take is where Veronica grabs the frisbee by the rim while I hold it. Yes. And so in this case, I'll say yes and follow it up with a toss because she really enjoys that and yes needs to mean that she's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=340.4s	340.4	 getting something great, at least something great in her mind. I love how she's bringing it back in the straight line like that. And I know she's had one catch, but she hasn't really had a big one since then. Yes. There you go. So a little baby catch. That's good. That's where they start. Good girl. See how she's like trying to put it together. Good. That's why we roll it so much that shows her Hey, at least go for that part of the frisbee, not the middle, not the top, the edge. And so far, she's kind of holding up pretty well with the full size frisbee here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=370.4s	370.4	 It's really fun watching her brainstorm this whole process and slowly put the steps together. Good. Here. There we go. Look at that. That was well done. I like how she just locked onto it immediately sprinted towards it. Hey, Veronica, you want to take a break? I'm going to continue to do frisbee lessons with her like this as long as she's into it. But I want to keep them pretty short and I don't want to overdo it with her being such a young puppy. Most of her exercise should really come from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=400.4s	400.4	 self directed play right now like free walks and stuff like that. So I'll still do these frisbee sessions but I want to be mindful of her age. Getting some zoom action in here from the pups. We're in an uncontrolled environment. So Veronica is of course on leash long lead inertia has learned the perfect length to play chase. We've been playing frisbee here. So both dogs are a bit winded but not too winded I guess. Favorite thing on earth to watch is dogs playing chase like this. I have some plans for some training right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=430.4s	430.4	 But I thought I might start it off by encouraging her to be relatively calm because she's already offering pretty calm behavior right now. You guys know Veronica I mean you've seen her in the past. She can easily get hyper and she's about to make a liar out of me. She's on alert for something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=448.9s	448.9	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=451.0s	451.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=451.6s	451.6	 Try not to say yes and use the clicker for demonstration purposes. You know today I'm going to be doing a little bit of clicker training. You guys will remember that the click means good dog. I like that. Here you get something you want. But don't worry you can still easily say yes in lieu of the clicker and follow that up with a treat or something your dog likes if you're not using clicker training. And if you're wondering why sometimes I use a clicker and sometimes I don't it's because I want people to feel liberated to train their dog if they don't happen to have access to a clicker at any given moment. But I think that's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=481.6s	481.6	 Strongly endorse clicker training guys here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=484.9s	484.9	 And you guys know I mean the theme of this series for us has been her excessive barking. So anytime I see it emerge. I mean I try to preempt it. See when she perks up and she looks I'm like you know what that's what she does before she barks a lot. So if I can get that attention on me and reinforce the quiet and better yet quiet and calm this. Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=505.3s	505.3	 That would be amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=506.4s	506.4	 Good example right there. We also talk about the rate at which we reward with her meals like this sometimes you know how sometimes it's really fast. Are you noticing how right now the pace is really slow. So just here and there one kibble. It seems to be doing the trick. I'm just giving her a partial meal today for her training. But right now this calm behavior I mean see how her hips are nice and shifted. She doesn't seem too rambunctious right now. She's just generally pretty chill. And I think we're getting really lucky because she's got a lot of energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=536.4s	536.4	 Because I don't always get this out of her. But since she's offering it so well out here I really just kind of want to periodically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=545.8s	545.8	 And give her a treat. But I also want her to be able to evaluate things right now. She's looking at birds very intently. I want her to satisfy that curiosity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=554.5s	554.5	 And I also want to acknowledge I like that you didn't fixate on that bird and start barking slowly but surely over time. This is how she'll learn the concept of behaving calmly even around things that excite her. But now let's engage that brain of hers and see if we can teach her something crazy amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=573.0s	573.0	 Go to your mark is simply go to a predetermined spot. In this case the spot is going to be this piece of silicone. What I love about this trick is that it's a great brainstorming activity for dog. I have not worked on this at all with her. This is absolutely the first time. So I don't know how it's going to go. Right now I'm looking for any movement towards that pad. You see that you see how she's inching towards the pad. To give her some guidance here I might do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=599.7s	599.7	 I'm just so I'm actually clicking her motion towards the mat here. I mean ultimately I'd like her to come over here and either sit or stand or lie down. I mean I think they'll all work. Okay. Good. We're going to release her from that. Now I want to see how much of that stuck. We're going to do a bit of an experiment. Is she just going to go into a down or is she going to make her way towards the mat here. I know that was a cute stretch. And so here she's like oh this is the routine. I sit I lie down. I get a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=626.5s	626.5	 Slowly slugged my way over to this mat. Do you see what we did there. I did two things. She glanced at the mat. So I clicked that I then placed the reward to encourage her to spend the time over there. I'm not looking for the completed task of going to the mark and staying right now. I'm really just looking for any step in the right direction to acknowledge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=647.3s	647.3	 I mean the prance of the pause she's thinking I have to reward the initiative. These are the nuances. So many sounds right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=659.3s	659.3	 That counts. That's two feet kind of. So maybe we do this. How about this. I'm going to help her out a little bit by putting the treat on the mat from way over here and see if that helps us advance a bit. No treats on my hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=672.0s	672.0	 Once again treating her for going on the mat not getting the treat. I think I'm going to try to see if I can get her to put her two front feet on this mat while holding a stand just to make it a little extra hard because she likes to go into that down because I've made it work for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=687.0s	687.0	 OK. So that was my first example of having her in a stand with two feet on there. Not perfect. That's OK. We can't go for perfection here. She's getting distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=697.8s	697.8	 You can hear those birds are very present. Once she gets those two front paws on there I'm rapidly clicking her and giving her lots of kibbles here because it keeps her standing up. She understands if you hold they keep coming at a pretty good rate. This is a good example of throttling that rate of reinforcement depending on where you are when you're teaching a new given task. So no treat on there this time. Let me see something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=721.5s	721.5	 This is where I've got to be careful. I don't want to cause frustration. So I'm going to go ahead and click.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=731.5s	731.5	 If I had been stubborn and insisted that she put two feet on there without a kibble present I would have missed out on that incredible success. I think this is a good lesson in being flexible when you're trying to help your dog understand something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=744.3s	744.3	 OK. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=746.3s	746.3	 Now I'm getting a secondary reaction here. So I'm going to shift gears to address the barking. Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=754.3s	754.3	 Fine. There she gets something because she took her attention off the thing that was causing her bark and onto me. But the distraction is not lost on me. So I am now going to go back and make it easier for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=767.1s	767.1	 Since the environment has changed a little bit it's become a bit more distracting. I'm going to compensate for that by making the training session extra easy for her at least for the moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=777.1s	777.1	 Let me start to give her a cue. I'm going to stick with a visual only one. I'm just going to tap it like that. Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=782.1s	782.1	 I'm deliberately withholding a click and a reward here until she actually puts her two front feet on the mat. I'm giving her a second to see if she brainstorms here rather than trying to give her the cue over and over again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=795.8s	795.8	 I'm really allowing her to take her time and think out her next move. And now I'm going to be a little more greedy and try and get her to put that other foot right there. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=803.8s	803.8	 And see how she's frozen because she really gets this. She's like I don't want to move because that's making the clicker go off. Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=811.8s	811.8	 Using the word yes could accomplish the same thing. But a lot of people prefer to use this and I don't blame them one bit because it's a great way to communicate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=821.6s	821.6	 This is an example of what you can do with one meal and wait until you see how we attempt to evolve this behavior moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=831.6s	831.6	 See how purposeful that was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=833.6s	833.6	 Part of our dog training process isn't just to work on obedience and training but it's to give the dogs brand new and dynamic experiences as well as ourselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=842.6s	842.6	 And now that we've done our training today it's time to go on a free walk. It's one of the perks of the job I guess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=848.3s	848.3	 Come on let's go free walk. You having fun Inersha? You having a good time? How about you Veronica? You pulling on leash? Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=854.3s	854.3	 It's so cool everywhere we walk we see just new and different stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=858.3s	858.3	 This is a lovely walking path and we are so rural right now. Yep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=862.3s	862.3	 How's she doing with her real life leave it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=864.3s	864.3	 Oh not great with this poop she really likes it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=868.3s	868.3	 That's the thing about this beautiful area there's ungulate poop everywhere. What is in these holes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=876.1s	876.1	 Based on how Inersha is acting right now I'm pretty positive there's definitely some kind of mammal and these are everywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=882.1s	882.1	 There's one, there's one. This is a historic Mormon site.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=887.1s	887.1	 What a gorgeous area look at this. These rocks are hundreds of millions of years old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=892.1s	892.1	 You know guys you just never know when a pronged horde is going to run out in front of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=896.1s	896.1	 This journey is full of all sorts of training opportunities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=900.1s	900.1	 I'm not sure what Veronica is doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=902.9s	902.9	 As we're traveling in this part of the world we're finding abandoned cabins and ruins left and right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=906.9s	906.9	 What's amazing is we're able to see these structures that don't appear to have been touched in decades.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=911.9s	911.9	 I couldn't resist taking a closer look at one of these abandoned cabins and this has got to be one of the eeriest experiences I've had.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=919.9s	919.9	 I walked up to this cabin and I slowly peeked in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=923.9s	923.9	 It was crazy to see that that mattress had been there for decades just slowly disintegrating away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=930.6s	930.6	 Can you hear the wind blowing in here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=932.6s	932.6	 You just can't help but wonder who lived here and why they left it or if they left.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=937.6s	937.6	 Okay I'm done wondering this because I am freaked out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=943.6s	943.6	 That was so creepy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=945.6s	945.6	 Well it's been a matter of hours since Veronica has had a serious barking outburst.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=951.6s	951.6	 What is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=953.6s	953.6	 I think she's detected this dog. She has such sensitive hearing much better hearing than me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=957.6s	957.6	 It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=960.4s	960.4	 Veronica continues to be thrown off by just about every new sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=964.4s	964.4	 Very sensitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=966.4s	966.4	 You can see the struggle there, the stress, yawn and she's really conflicted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=971.4s	971.4	 I want to bark but I see you're trying to communicate with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=975.4s	975.4	 The focus is mostly on Bree right now rather than just tuning her out and barking at the things she wants to bark at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=981.4s	981.4	 In this case this dog out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=984.4s	984.4	 That's the hardest thing for inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=987.1s	987.1	 She's pretty good these days but every once in a while she'll start barking at the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=999.1s	999.1	 Go ahead and ask for her attention and try and get her to relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1002.1s	1002.1	 That's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1004.1s	1004.1	 Can you relax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1006.1s	1006.1	 Such a good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1008.1s	1008.1	 I'm waiting for the acknowledgement to your face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1010.1s	1010.1	 She hasn't looked at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1012.1s	1012.1	 Can you be quiet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1014.1s	1014.1	 Good girl. She looked at me out of the corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1016.9s	1016.9	 It's not like your dog has to stare at you to acknowledge you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1019.9s	1019.9	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1021.9s	1021.9	 She's learning that she's going to be redirected into that calm state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1025.9s	1025.9	 It's more about her mindset as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1027.9s	1027.9	 I love how you're encouraging her to be calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1029.9s	1029.9	 Veronica, it's normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1031.9s	1031.9	 Can you relax?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1033.9s	1033.9	 It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1035.9s	1035.9	 I'm just going to relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1039.9s	1039.9	 Her voice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1041.9s	1041.9	 Quiet honey, relax.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1043.9s	1043.9	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1046.7s	1046.7	 Well done girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1048.7s	1048.7	 Thank you. That's better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1050.7s	1050.7	 Notice too how Bree was so purposeful about not rewarding a second after the barking but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1056.7s	1056.7	 rewarding the calm behavior by giving her a treat and communicating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1060.7s	1060.7	 look that's what I'm looking for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1062.7s	1062.7	 And she's starting to get the message.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1064.7s	1064.7	 And to be fair, it is completely unrealistic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1066.7s	1066.7	 perhaps even unethical to insist that a dog not bark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1070.7s	1070.7	 I mean this is how they express themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1072.7s	1072.7	 This is part of being a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1075.4s	1075.4	 There's times where it feels like it's so out of control,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1082.4s	1082.4	 but I can actually tell it's getting so much better because even though she barks a million times a day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1088.4s	1088.4	 I'm able to get through to her now and get her to stop most of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1092.4s	1092.4	 I feel like over 50% of the time, I think we're starting to turn a corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1096.4s	1096.4	 They got the right energy though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1098.4s	1098.4	 I'm watching these guys play with a dog and that is what you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1101.4s	1101.4	 I'm inspired. This makes me want to get out and train my dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1104.4s	1104.4	 We've had such an active few days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1106.4s	1106.4	 I love that we're getting this cumulative effect of them wanting to sleep in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1110.4s	1110.4	 They're not always like this. If you try to skip their exercise, these dogs will let you know it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1115.4s	1115.4	 I think I've been in denial about her level of shedding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1118.4s	1118.4	 Yep. Oh my God. Yes you have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1120.4s	1120.4	 It's like 10 cent. Look at that. Oh God.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1122.4s	1122.4	 She's shedding so bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1124.4s	1124.4	 Yeah, she's full on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1126.4s	1126.4	 Satisfying. Although you got an escaping tumbleweed over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1128.4s	1128.4	 I'm going to be out here a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1130.4s	1130.4	 He's going to be out here a while, he says.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1133.4s	1133.4	 Oh my goodness. Ouch, Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1138.4s	1138.4	 It's hard to believe, but Veronica still has some crazy energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1141.4s	1141.4	 Even after all of our adventures today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1143.4s	1143.4	 We're taking a quick walk before bedtime, so hopefully we can all get some sleep tonight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1148.4s	1148.4	 We found some cows. The dogs are checking them out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1151.4s	1151.4	 I'm holding Veronica because she immediately started jumping around and there's a highway right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1155.4s	1155.4	 So I don't want to take any chances.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1157.4s	1157.4	 I know. Look, those are big cows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1159.4s	1159.4	 We take them for granted, but when we see a moose it's like, whoa, big deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1163.4s	1163.4	 Here's a field of cows which are almost as big as moose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hka5zjCuTZ0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=103&pp=iAQB&t=1166.4s	1166.4	 We just kind of expect the dogs to tune them out.
