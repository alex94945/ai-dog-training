https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=75.6s	75.6	 his dad James.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=77.0s	77.0	 James, what is the story with Remington?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 I've wanted a dog for as long as I can remember, but I didn't have everything together that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=84.3s	84.3	 would have allowed me to have one, you know, with school and traveling for work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=88.0s	88.0	 Once everything kind of came together, I immediately started looking for one and got lucky to find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=92.0s	92.0	 Remington at just the right time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=93.3s	93.3	 You work from home, you have that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=94.3s	94.3	 I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=95.3s	95.3	 Yep, I get to spend all day with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=96.3s	96.3	 The only times he's really in the crate are when I have to go run around an errand or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=99.6s	99.6	 if I get lucky enough to get invited to a happy hour or something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=102.6s	102.6	 Otherwise, he's pretty much out and roaming around the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=104.6s	104.6	 My favorite thing about the Duck Tolling Retrievers are that they were basically bred to play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 fetch, honestly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=111.1s	111.1	 Their job is to, well, I don't know, do you want to tell us what their job is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=113.9s	113.9	 I'm not sure he's going to be much of a hunter, but his job is to go out and play in the water
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 and the sound of somebody playing in the water attracts the ducks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=121.8s	121.8	 And so the ducks kind of fly down and then the hunters get their chance to take advantage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=125.8s	125.8	 and then he goes and retrieves them after they're done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=127.8s	127.8	 As far as training goes, how would you describe your progress so far?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=130.7s	130.7	 Because you've only had them, what, two or three weeks or something?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=132.6s	132.6	 Yeah, it's been a little bit less than a month.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=134.4s	134.4	 We're starting slow and simple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 We're getting down just the nose and trying to get the potty training and really focusing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=141.5s	141.5	 on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=142.5s	142.5	 Sometimes we have to be like, no, I don't like that, but I do like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=145.4s	145.4	 And we want the emphasis to be on what we do like wherever possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=148.6s	148.6	 That takes a little practice, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=149.9s	149.9	 Yeah, for both of us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 My hope today, James, is to go over the top five biggest mistakes that most new puppy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=156.2s	156.2	 parents make.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=157.7s	157.7	 We can start with number five here, which is getting frustrated, particularly with play
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=162.4s	162.4	 biting early on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 This is probably the original point of frustration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=166.0s	166.0	 Oh yeah, it's very frustrating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=167.4s	167.4	 It's a normal emotion we all have to deal with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=169.7s	169.7	 The play biting is so natural, it takes many weeks to months to really get a handle on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=174.6s	174.6	 play biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=175.6s	175.6	 So it's something we have to prepare ourselves for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=177.9s	177.9	 I think the most important thing to understand about frustration is progress cannot be achieved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 when either you or your dog is in a frustrated mindset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=187.3s	187.3	 A couple other things in this category are unwanted chewing and potty training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=191.6s	191.6	 Those also take a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 So we have to keep our expectations very realistic on those things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=196.6s	196.6	 Play biting is some of the most predictable behavior there is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=200.0s	200.0	 You know when it's going to occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=201.3s	201.3	 Oh yeah, you can see it in his face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=202.8s	202.8	 Yes, you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=203.8s	203.8	 Exactly, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=204.8s	204.8	 So it's more important to show our dogs what we do like rather than what we don't like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=208.5s	208.5	 So in the instance of play biting, the way to address it is when you go up to them and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=212.3s	212.3	 you know they're likely to bite, you come prepared with a treat, you put them into a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=216.1s	216.1	 sit and you reward them for sitting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=218.5s	218.5	 In other words, what we're trying to communicate to them is, look, when I come up to you, this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=221.5s	221.5	 is what I want you to do, not bite me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=223.6s	223.6	 And before you know it, he's going to take you off the list of things that he's allowed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=228.1s	228.1	 to bite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 There's a fine line between rewarding your dog for biting on you and giving them a treat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=232.8s	232.8	 immediately and asking them to do something before giving them the treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 Good, very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=238.0s	238.0	 The other thing you can do is get something like this, encourage them to chew on this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=242.6s	242.6	 but understand they're still going to miss you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=244.1s	244.1	 They're still going to get your hand even though you have this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=246.7s	246.7	 That's part of the training process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 When you do choose the second option here and you opt to have them bite on a toy like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=253.7s	253.7	 this, you're still encouraging them to bite and they're still going to be in that vigorous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=257.4s	257.4	 mood and they may even accelerate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=259.1s	259.1	 So you'll need to make this a training session on how to play with the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=262.6s	262.6	 You can't be as passive as you can when you're using food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=266.9s	266.9	 Treating them open palm like this will save your skin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=270.1s	270.1	 Sincerely and enthusiastically let your dog know when you like the way they're behaving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=274.9s	274.9	 Dogs detect sincerity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=276.2s	276.2	 But the more consistent you are, the faster this will get done.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=278.8s	278.8	 You need to allow two to three to four months to really get a serious handle on play biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=284.8s	284.8	 Let's talk about the fourth most common mistake that I see and that is lack of supervision
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=289.1s	289.1	 with a young puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=290.2s	290.2	 Now I believe that everyone starts off with good intentions on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=293.4s	293.4	 You know, the first few days we get a young puppy like this, they're still relatively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=296.6s	296.6	 small and relatively slow compared to what they will be in a few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=301.1s	301.1	 So we tend to get kind of content on how easy they are to get to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=305.6s	305.6	 Dogs are famous for their curiosity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1JGfzaW9A&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=565&pp=iAQB&t=307.7s	307.7	 So as their physical and cognitive ability start to accelerate and believe me, they do
