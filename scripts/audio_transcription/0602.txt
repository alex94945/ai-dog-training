https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=32.6s	32.6	 Dogs tend to be reactive on a leash for a couple of major reasons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=37.8s	37.8	 Usually it's because they just are frustrated and they want to get at something to go investigate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=42.3s	42.3	 it or play with another dog or do something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=45.2s	45.2	 This is so often misunderstood as aggression when really it's just a dog being curious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=51.3s	51.3	 wanting to go up to something.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 a time and a place for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=57.9s	57.9	 I'm going to show you in this video how to get some traction with your dog and build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=62.3s	62.3	 communication with them when they're in this heightened state of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=66.3s	66.3	 Since being on a leash is somewhat unnatural for a lot of dogs, especially in the beginning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=71.5s	71.5	 many dogs feel more vulnerable when on a leash and tend to act a bit defensive too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 The first thing to understand is why is your dog acting the way they're acting when on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=80.9s	80.9	 a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=81.9s	81.9	 I should state also, this is very common behavior for very young dogs or dogs new to a leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=86.8s	86.8	 or dogs new to a new family or environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=89.6s	89.6	 So be understanding of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=91.3s	91.3	 This is a pretty advanced concept for a lot of people to understand generally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 However, I'm going to make it very easy to understand for you today as I try and do in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 all of my dog training videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=101.7s	101.7	 Make sure you're subscribed and click thumbs up for this video as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=109.9s	109.9	 Most people can.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=113.1s	113.1	 The best time to correct your dog acting crazy when they see a distraction while walking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 them, whether it be a dog or vehicle or whatever, is to correct the behavior before it occurs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=122.6s	122.6	 This whole idea of preemption takes a lot of practice, but you'll get good at it as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=128.1s	128.1	 long as you're focused on it and really giving all of your attention to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=132.4s	132.4	 Now, traditional dog training has always focused on correcting this with the choke chain or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=138.5s	138.5	 and most recently, the shock collars are a real common way to correct this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=143.2s	143.2	 Now, of course, these are highly unethical and should never be used.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=146.7s	146.7	 Nonetheless, it's very common, which is why I'm going to address it in this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=150.9s	150.9	 You see, waiting for the behavior to occur to then correct it is about 10 times less
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=157.0s	157.0	 effective than correcting the behavior before it happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=160.6s	160.6	 We want to suggest to our dog, look, I know what you're thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=163.7s	163.7	 I want your attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=165.2s	165.2	 And if you listen to me, great things are going to happen for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 Dante the schnauzer is a really good example of what a lot of you might be dealing with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=172.2s	172.2	 with your own dogs because he's young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=174.4s	174.4	 There's not a lot of existing communication yet because he hasn't gone through a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=178.4s	178.4	 training yet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=181.3s	181.3	 The first thing we want to do is break their attention on whatever it is that's distracting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=185.4s	185.4	 them that can most easily be done by using real turkey or some type of real meat to break
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=191.6s	191.6	 their attention and bring it on to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=193.4s	193.4	 This would not be a long term strategy, but rather a place to get a little bit of traction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=198.4s	198.4	 so that we can get their attention on to us and back into training mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 This will not always work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=203.7s	203.7	 It didn't work with Dante the schnauzer, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=206.4s	206.4	 So we have to do whatever we can to get their mental state off of whatever it is that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 making them act in this manner.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=216.6s	216.6	 Some dogs feel more calm when they're picked up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=219.2s	219.2	 Again, we wouldn't do this long term, but in the very beginning, it's fine to do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 never do we attempt to fix a behavior or teach a new concept all in one swing of the bat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 It's all done in little bits and we have to be very focused and mindful that our dog learns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=236.1s	236.1	 a little bit at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 Now after doing this for a minute or two, Dante did calm down and we were able to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=242.1s	242.1	 him back into training mode.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=245.4s	245.4	 So our next step is to create distance between our dog and whatever it is that they're distracted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=251.2s	251.2	 by.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=256.7s	256.7	 who's walking towards us down the street.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=261.9s	261.9	 They may stop, they may try and get their dog's attention, they may pull back on the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=268.5s	268.5	 avail because their dog is so overstimulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=271.3s	271.3	 Again, that might mean having a dramatic distance between you and whatever it is that they want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=277.7s	277.7	 to get at.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=278.7s	278.7	 Cameron and her dog Charlie illustrate this beautifully.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=281.3s	281.3	 Now I've actually shown you this clip before, but I think it's worth revisiting because

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=289.8s	289.8	 your dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmc6fjM_y4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=603&pp=iAQB&t=297.2s	297.2	 as a puppy.
