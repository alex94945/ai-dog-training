https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 In this episode, I'm going to keep working on training Inertia how to stop barking at virtually everything that moves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=6.3s	6.3	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=7.6s	7.6	 I train dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=8.6s	8.6	 This is my new dog, and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=12.6s	12.6	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=15.1s	15.1	 You can start from the beginning or you can pick up anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=18.1s	18.1	 Subscribe and hit the bell notification so you never miss an episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect, your results will forever remain in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=27.2s	27.2	 This is Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 Guys, wait until you see this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=34.6s	34.6	 You've never seen anything quite like this in the world of dog food before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=38.5s	38.5	 Nom Nom is a revolutionary meal service for your pet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=41.7s	41.7	 Every meal is freshly prepared just before it ships to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=44.8s	44.8	 You just tell Nom Nom your pet's age, breed, and size.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=47.8s	47.8	 This is like having a pet nutritionist in your pocket.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=50.1s	50.1	 Let me show you how it arrives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=51.6s	51.6	 They pack it with dry ice and you can see how super insulated that is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=55.4s	55.4	 You get different formulas like chicken or beef or turkey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=58.2s	58.2	 This is actually human-grade food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=59.7s	59.7	 I mean, you could eat this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=60.8s	60.8	 This tastes a lot better than the vast majority of dog food that I've eaten before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 Nom Nom only uses restaurant-quality USDA-grade ingredients.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=69.4s	69.4	 You can clearly see the chicken, the sweet potatoes, the squash, and the spinach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=74.2s	74.2	 All right, let's see what Inertia thinks of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=76.1s	76.1	 She doesn't normally gobble down food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 She's kind of a dainty eater, but you can see by the way she's eating this food, she's loving it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=82.5s	82.5	 And they do give you several different formulas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=84.5s	84.5	 For example, the beef recipe has beef, potatoes, eggs, carrots, and peas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=88.4s	88.4	 This is your dinner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=89.2s	89.2	 You cannot have two meals back to back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=91.8s	91.8	 Nice try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=92.9s	92.9	 You can also set up regular shipments of this so that your dog never runs out of food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=96.8s	96.8	 Try Nom Nom today by going to trinom.com slash Zach and you'll get 50% off of a two-week trial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=102.9s	102.9	 I'll have a link in the description below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 So this has become one of our favorite practice fields.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=107.5s	107.5	 There are a steady stream of distractions to train around, not the least of which is this bridge right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=112.7s	112.7	 Now you might think, okay, it's a bridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=114.5s	114.5	 What's so distracting about that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=115.9s	115.9	 The way it's situated, sometimes things come bursting seemingly out of nowhere, like a bike or a scooter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 even a jogger or maybe a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=123.4s	123.4	 And those things can be really exciting when your dog is suddenly presented with something like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=128.5s	128.5	 One thing I've noticed is that Inertia generally has been well behaved when dogs walk nearby.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=133.1s	133.1	 But if they show an interest in interacting with her, as the dog on the end does here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=137.8s	137.8	 she has a really hard time containing her excitement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=141.2s	141.2	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=142.1s	142.1	 When Inertia is this excited, I need to fall back on managing her, not training her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=146.5s	146.5	 since it's not realistic to actually train a dog in these moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=150.0s	150.0	 This means I need to do a better job of preparing Inertia to handle situations like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=155.1s	155.1	 While she generally does very well down here, just a few feet away, if we're right here, she can't handle it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=160.0s	160.0	 So something I'm prioritizing is doing some surgical training right here in this exact situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=166.7s	166.7	 The point is, when you notice a specific trigger or something that really throws your dog off,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=171.3s	171.3	 avoid the trap of avoiding that type of training scenario
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=174.3s	174.3	 and go out of your way to set up more manageable training scenarios.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=177.3s	177.3	 So in this case, I'm out here, my mindset is we're just gonna exist right here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 and let her see things come across the bridge and do some desensitizing so it's not so abnormal for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=186.6s	186.6	 Okay, here comes a nice easy distraction where I think I can keep her attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=190.6s	190.6	 I'll practice getting her attention on me as this family walks by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 Good job. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=195.1s	195.1	 Things with wheels have a higher probability of setting Inertia off,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=198.2s	198.2	 but again, notice the distance I'm maintaining from the distractions during the beginning part of this lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=203.9s	203.9	 Here comes another dog. Let's give it a shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=206.8s	206.8	 No, so close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=208.3s	208.3	 Okay, Inertia is a little friskier today than normal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=211.1s	211.1	 but I'm at least encouraged by the fact that she's recovering from these outbursts pretty quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=215.5s	215.5	 Good girl. Stay there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=218.1s	218.1	 Okay, much better that time. Let's try again with another dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=222.7s	222.7	 There's an instance right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 Dog walking by and her maintaining her composure. I appreciate that, Inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=229.8s	229.8	 We've been out here for several minutes now and you'll notice that the more time we spend out here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=233.6s	233.6	 the more likely Inertia is to behave normally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=236.1s	236.1	 Just even walking across this bridge kind of throws her off and sends her into a bit of a frantic state,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=241.6s	241.6	 so it's clear to me that I need to do more training specifically on this bridge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=245.7s	245.7	 rather than just rushing over it on my normal morning walk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=248.8s	248.8	 It really seems that the sound of wheels coming across that wooden bridge really heightens her awareness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=253.6s	253.6	 and causes her to become excited. In fact, just being on the bridge increases her arousal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=258.3s	258.3	 While there's no one coming across, I'm going to take some time to do some leash training on the bridge over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=263.4s	263.4	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=270.4s	270.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=272.3s	272.3	 Stomping on the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=273.8s	273.8	 You know, this may not look like much, but this is quite an improvement for Inertia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=277.7s	277.7	 while we walk on this particular texture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=280.1s	280.1	 Yep, you can even hear there are some loose boards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=283.6s	283.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=286.6s	286.6	 Let's go. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=288.3s	288.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=290.1s	290.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=291.7s	291.7	 Come here. This way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=293.2s	293.2	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=295.5s	295.5	 So I just took off after that bicycle there because I wanted to get her seeing the bicycle going over the bridge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=303.5s	303.5	 while paying attention to me at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=305.0s	305.0	 I really saw it in her eyes that she's like, OK, I'll do what you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 Like she was in a less distractible mindset there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=310.1s	310.1	 Yes. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 You're doing a wonderful job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=313.6s	313.6	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=314.6s	314.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=315.6s	315.6	 Stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=318.6s	318.6	 Switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=320.6s	320.6	 Come on. Let's go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=331.6s	331.6	 Well, let's go this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=332.6s	332.6	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=335.6s	335.6	 Easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=338.6s	338.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=339.6s	339.6	 Stand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=341.6s	341.6	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=342.6s	342.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=344.6s	344.6	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=345.6s	345.6	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=346.6s	346.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=347.6s	347.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=348.6s	348.6	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=349.6s	349.6	 Look at me this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=350.6s	350.6	 Keep moving. Keep moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=352.6s	352.6	 Let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=353.6s	353.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=355.6s	355.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=356.6s	356.6	 OK. Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=357.6s	357.6	 So that was an amazing example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=359.6s	359.6	 In general, it's harder for dogs to focus on you while moving versus while still, at least at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=365.6s	365.6	 So here I'll just have her stay because I know dogs are particularly distracting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=369.6s	369.6	 Don't move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=371.6s	371.6	 Everything that comes by is a unique experience for inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=374.6s	374.6	 I mean, the random nature of these real world distractions is hard to artificially create.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=379.6s	379.6	 So there's nothing like getting out here and practicing and controlling the variables that you can,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=383.6s	383.6	 like easily being able to extend or shorten the distance between your dog and the various distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=389.6s	389.6	 Yeah. Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=390.6s	390.6	 And so, you know, you might recall there was a time when if a jogger was passing by that close to range, she would be thrown off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=397.6s	397.6	 OK, we're caught off guard here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=398.6s	398.6	 We're actually on the bridge and a bike is coming at us and there's no time to create distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=403.6s	403.6	 Let's see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=408.6s	408.6	 So.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=411.6s	411.6	 There you go. That's the thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=412.6s	412.6	 I can't pull off and get her away from that bike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=414.6s	414.6	 So we have to work on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=416.6s	416.6	 Once again, a bike is approaching fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=418.6s	418.6	 And since I know an outburst is more likely, I'm going to create a closer training bubble because dogs are more likely to listen when you're close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=426.6s	426.6	 And I'm going to hold her by the harness just so that I can promptly manage an outburst if it does occur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=432.6s	432.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=433.6s	433.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=434.6s	434.6	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=435.6s	435.6	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=436.6s	436.6	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=437.6s	437.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=438.6s	438.6	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=439.6s	439.6	 That was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=440.6s	440.6	 And stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=442.6s	442.6	 Oh, amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=444.6s	444.6	 So that was that was one of our best examples to date where I was able to get her attention on me while on the bridge, while a bike rode past us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=454.6s	454.6	 We're going to try to build on that here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=456.6s	456.6	 And so it also helps being able to have her heel on the right side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=459.6s	459.6	 It also helps having her heel on the left side here too, just so I can be a barrier between her and a bike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=465.6s	465.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=466.6s	466.6	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=467.6s	467.6	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=468.6s	468.6	 Easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=469.6s	469.6	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=470.6s	470.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=471.6s	471.6	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=472.6s	472.6	 Look at me here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=473.6s	473.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=475.6s	475.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=476.6s	476.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=477.6s	477.6	 So you can see when the bikes come by there, she's getting better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=486.6s	486.6	 I mean, it's still difficult for her to focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=488.6s	488.6	 You can hear the sound of those bikes coming over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=491.6s	491.6	 She's recovering more and more quickly now that we're spending time out here, just specifically focused.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=497.6s	497.6	 And another dog coming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=498.6s	498.6	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=499.6s	499.6	 Let's go this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=500.6s	500.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=501.6s	501.6	 That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=503.6s	503.6	 Oh, my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=505.6s	505.6	 There's a dog behind us and you are paying attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=507.6s	507.6	 Look at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=508.6s	508.6	 Hi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=510.6s	510.6	 Good job, girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=511.6s	511.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=514.6s	514.6	 You're starting to see a pattern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=515.6s	515.6	 The more time we spend out here, the more reliable she becomes around distractions like dogs, bikes, strollers, and other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=525.6s	525.6	 You're going to have some good days and some days that are not so good and some days in between.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=530.6s	530.6	 So today was kind of an in-between day, but I'm still very proud of her because she really did show a lot of progress in many areas, especially with bikes going over the bridge and dogs walking by.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJWrqz4UR7w&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=272&pp=iAQB&t=540.6s	540.6	 If you guys enjoy seeing the full process of working through issues like this, click thumbs up.
