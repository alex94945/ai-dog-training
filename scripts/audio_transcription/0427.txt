https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=22.3s	22.3	 But maybe your parents have some reservations about getting a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=25.9s	25.9	 If you need to convince your parents that you want a new dog,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=47.4s	47.4	 I love how the bookmark here is like a rope toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=49.6s	49.6	 It feels like there's two squeakers in there, that's cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=51.7s	51.7	 That adds another dimension to it completely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=54.0s	54.0	 When you can find a good toy that your dog likes to play tug with, that's always a winner.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=58.9s	58.9	 Every single one of these toys has a unique texture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 Like this one is a little bit more firm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=63.3s	63.3	 This one's just more soft and it's got a squeak toy in it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=101.1s	101.1	 Raising a dog is a little bit more intricate than most people realize, regardless of how old you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=105.6s	105.6	 She is not designed for rollover at all.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=110.9s	110.9	 Another rollover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=112.2s	112.2	 A fair amount of life experience is necessary before you can really hope to be an effective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=116.4s	116.4	 teacher to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=117.7s	117.7	 So how old should someone be in order to be the primary trainer for their new dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 On average, I would say that a person who's about 11 or 12 years old is probably the right age to start teaching a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 But you know, I've seen kids as young as nine years old be exceptional at training their dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=132.6s	132.6	 as long as they're really tuned in and motivated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=135.3s	135.3	 Regardless of your age, though, teaching a new dog can be so gratifying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=138.8s	138.8	 We learn so much about ourselves when raising a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=141.4s	141.4	 Virtues like patience, empathy and love are strengthened when we teach dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=145.2s	145.2	 And you learn about consistency and the feeling of accomplishment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 No matter how many dogs you teach, you learn that they're all different and all require a unique approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=153.8s	153.8	 You are definitely a different dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 And every single one of them can teach us something new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=158.8s	158.8	 You're teaching me that I don't want my ears bitten today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=161.5s	161.5	 There are some things you're going to need to consider before you pitch your parents for a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=165.2s	165.2	 I mean, it is no joke that dogs, especially puppies like this, are a ton of work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=171.2s	171.2	 See what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 We're talking about not letting you sleep well for weeks, nipping, puppy biting, chewing up everything in sight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=177.8s	177.8	 And none of these issues are resolved quickly either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=180.3s	180.3	 It takes a year of dedicated, sustained training before you can even begin to consider your dog trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=186.0s	186.0	 It's really important to have everybody in the family on board and excited about a new dog when you get one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=191.7s	191.7	 If you're young, you've got a lot going on with school, extracurricular activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=195.6s	195.6	 Maybe you've even got a part time job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=197.5s	197.5	 But you're really going to need your family to be partners with you in this venture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=201.8s	201.8	 Your parents are going to need to share in this responsibility because they've got more life experience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=205.9s	205.9	 not to mention that they've got the money for the food and the vet appointments your dog will require.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=210.4s	210.4	 And they're going to have the final word when it comes to a new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=212.8s	212.8	 So you will need to respect their decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=214.6s	214.6	 Really consider the time frame for this commitment, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=216.9s	216.9	 I mean, many dogs can live 15 years easily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=219.8s	219.8	 So, I mean, let's say you're 12 years old right now and about six years you're going to go off to college.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 And who knows where that will be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=226.1s	226.1	 And truthfully, it's probably going to be best for you and your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 If your dog stays at home with your parents while you go to college,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=232.1s	232.1	 so that you can focus on getting an education and you really have to be considerate of committing your parents to this future obligation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=238.2s	238.2	 I mean, could you imagine committing them to take care of a dog like Kiwi?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=241.7s	241.7	 That's OK. You're easy to take care of, except when you bite the ear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=244.9s	244.9	 Why do you keep doing that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 For these reasons, it's ultimately your parents responsibility to raise and care for any new dog that comes into your life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=252.1s	252.1	 And if you're a parent, you must accept this before agreeing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=255.6s	255.6	 But there are lots of ways that you can show your parents that you're up to the task of doing your part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 If you've weighed the pros and cons and you've decided that you're definitely ready for a new dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 how do you go about showing your parents that you're truly ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=267.4s	267.4	 First, do your research.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=268.6s	268.6	 I mean, show your parents that you've done all you can to learn about raising and teaching a new dog before a dog even comes home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=274.6s	274.6	 Learn about the different kinds of dogs, their energy levels, how to take care of them and how to train them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=279.1s	279.1	 Learn as much as you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=280.6s	280.6	 Of course, my YouTube videos are going to show you an awful lot about raising and teaching your new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=285.7s	285.7	 But your parents are a lot more likely to take you seriously if you've done your research.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=291.0s	291.0	 And volunteering at your local shelter is a great way to get tons of experience with lots of different dogs, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=296.5s	296.5	 I mean, this can be a really good way to show your parents how dedicated you really are while they make their decision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=302.1s	302.1	 You'll meet lots of different dogs that have different personalities, different energy levels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=306.4s	306.4	 And that's something you have to really understand before you even get a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=309.6s	309.6	 Don't worry, I'm going to have a video in the description that will help you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fJGNxDBcgY&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=428&pp=iAQB&t=312.6s	312.6	 But experience really is the best teacher.
