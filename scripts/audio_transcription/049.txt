https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=4.7s	4.7	 If you had a choice, would you get a 10 week old puppy or would you get a dog that was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=8.1s	8.1	 out of the puppy stage?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=9.4s	9.4	 If you're thinking about getting a dog or you know somebody who is, make sure they see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=13.1s	13.1	 this video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 Why would I do a double thumbs up?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=18.6s	18.6	 It doesn't make sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=20.5s	20.5	 My name is Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=21.5s	21.5	 I'm a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=22.5s	22.5	 I train dogs without the intentional use of aversives.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=25.1s	25.1	 Recently I made a video talking about how I think a lot of people give too much consideration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 and not enough consideration to the individual dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=32.7s	32.7	 And I discussed a lot of the issues surrounding that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=35.4s	35.4	 Reading the comments, I saw people wanted to know the difference between getting a young
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=38.7s	38.7	 dog like a young puppy versus an adult dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=41.9s	41.9	 Now hypothetically, let's just pretend that you are going to get a dog in the next few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=47.0s	47.0	 If you had a choice, would you get a 10 week old puppy or would you get a dog that was

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=51.4s	51.4	 Like one year or older, we'll say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=53.4s	53.4	 Though plenty of one year olds are still puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=56.0s	56.0	 At what age does a dog go from being a puppy to being a dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 Nine months to two years is the short answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=63.9s	63.9	 Sexual maturity is what defines an adult dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 Okay, this is the fun part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=68.0s	68.0	 Let's talk about all of the pros with a brand new puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=71.1s	71.1	 If you guys think of something that I haven't and you will, please put them in the comments

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=76.1s	76.1	 With these young dogs, you have the advantage of being there for their critical socialization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=79.6s	79.6	 period, which is roughly four months and younger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 With puppies like this, ideally you want to give them broad exposure to a variety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=85.8s	85.8	 of age appropriate experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=88.3s	88.3	 Did you know that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=89.3s	89.3	 And there's that unique opportunity to build a really strong bond right from the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=94.0s	94.0	 When I get a brand new puppy, one of my favorite bonding experiences is playing tug of war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 with them for the first time and teaching them how to play with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=102.5s	102.5	 And one could make the case that you have more control over shaping the behaviors that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=107.1s	107.1	 you want to see repeated as well as preventing undesirable behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=110.8s	110.8	 For example, if you're the type of person to puppy proof your house, there's a good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=113.9s	113.9	 chance your dog is not going to get in the habit of destructive chewing because you'll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=118.1s	118.1	 phase in those chewable items to your dog over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=121.9s	121.9	 Another advantage to that kind of takes others into consideration would be imagine a family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=126.2s	126.2	 member who is a little nervous of bigger dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=128.8s	128.8	 For example, you get a puppy Rottweiler and they get to know the dog from a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=132.5s	132.5	 And as they get to know the dog before you know it, the dog is this big and no one's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=136.0s	136.0	 scared of the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=137.2s	137.2	 Typically, we're not going to see concerning aggressive behavior in young puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=141.0s	141.0	 We don't typically see that till adolescence, which might be between six and 18 months of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=145.6s	145.6	 age, maybe two years of age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=147.3s	147.3	 So from that perspective, it can make introductions easier with existing pets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 If you have a really specific need, maybe a working dog or a competition dog of some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=155.8s	155.8	 kind and you're trying to maximize their career lifespan, a younger dog might be more ideal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=161.6s	161.6	 And some people might say that puppies have a greater ability to adapt to their environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=166.7s	166.7	 And that's probably because they have no comparison.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 So you're in a position to really establish their routine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=171.9s	171.9	 And even though puppies do have a lot of energy, if you know how to harness that energy and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=176.7s	176.7	 direct it into productive activities that give them that safe natural outlet to experiment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=181.8s	181.8	 and interact with the world, that might be a little bit easier to do with a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=185.8s	185.8	 Or it might not, as we'll get into in a second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=188.6s	188.6	 Let's talk about some of the downsides as I see it when it comes to getting a young
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=191.8s	191.8	 puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=192.8s	192.8	 These are the big ones that should give people pause about adopting a young dog, particularly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=198.7s	198.7	 if you are not prepared for a major project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=202.5s	202.5	 Little bitty puppies who are brand new to the world know absolutely nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 They don't know anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=208.8s	208.8	 They're smart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=209.9s	209.9	 They just don't know anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=212.1s	212.1	 Do you know what that means?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=213.1s	213.1	 It means you are the one that if you want this done in an efficient manner, you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=218.9s	218.9	 to very proactively show this puppy how you want them to behave in virtually every aspect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=226.2s	226.2	 of their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=227.2s	227.2	 Think about it though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 They don't know what stairs are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=229.4s	229.4	 They don't know a food bowl and a water bowl are supposed to keep their contents inside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=234.0s	234.0	 of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=235.0s	235.0	 They don't know about sleep schedules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=237.0s	237.0	 We have to be really proactive about taking them outside very frequently if we hope to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=241.2s	241.2	 house train them efficiently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=242.4s	242.4	 And we have to do it in a way that is enjoyable and pleasant for the dog and for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=248.9s	248.9	 If you're coming at this in good faith and you really want to do the best you can with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=253.3s	253.3	 this dog, then understand it takes significant effort and you have a duty to socialize your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=257.8s	257.8	 dog to the world they'll be living in over their next lifetime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=262.5s	262.5	 And then there's that raw puppy energy, which as we discussed before, can be harnessed into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 productive activities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=269.5s	269.5	 But then there are many people out there who don't really want to take on all of this untamed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=272.9s	272.9	 puppy energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=273.9s	273.9	 And it's important to be honest with yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 Do you think you can handle that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=277.3s	277.3	 Because it takes a minute to build some initial communication with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=280.7s	280.7	 Let me just say it this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=281.8s	281.8	 The first year of life is greatly underestimated in terms of effort required from you by a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=292.5s	292.5	 I'm getting exhausted thinking about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=294.8s	294.8	 For those of you who are knee deep in raising a puppy right now in that first year, tell

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=304.1s	304.1	 Now let's talk about some of the advantages of training older dogs, which I guess is we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=307.5s	307.5	 defining it 10 months and older.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=309.7s	309.7	 We could literally be talking about a dog that's 10 months, two years or 10 years old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=313.5s	313.5	 There's a really good chance that a lot of these dogs have had some at least very basic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=317.5s	317.5	 training like sit, stay for your food, things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=320.5s	320.5	 And they've likely experienced a lot more socialization, which just means exposure to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=325.1s	325.1	 varied experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=327.2s	327.2	 Older dogs are going to be more mature and this might mean that they behave a bit calmer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=332.0s	332.0	 I said might, but they might not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=334.3s	334.3	 And sometimes with a more mature dog that can make training easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=337.7s	337.7	 Even dogs that spend significant time in foster care and shelters have figured out a lot about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=343.4s	343.4	 human culture and how to coexist with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=345.9s	345.9	 People who work in the shelter and rescue community are some of the most dedicated people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=349.3s	349.3	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=350.3s	350.3	 They're always trying to squeeze in a little bit of training here and there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=352.8s	352.8	 So that is often a benefit with getting a rescue dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=355.6s	355.6	 You could also say that they might be less distractible during training because puppies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=359.9s	359.9	 have literally seen very little, so every little thing is going to distract them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=364.5s	364.5	 Whereas even with a not so trained older dog, they've still seen things like butterflies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=369.6s	369.6	 and birds and may not become as distracted by things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=373.4s	373.4	 But they could.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=374.4s	374.4	 And an older dog is likely to have better bladder control, for example, though you still
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=378.1s	378.1	 need to house train any new dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=380.0s	380.0	 So they're familiar with the rules at your place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=382.5s	382.5	 The energy of a grown dog is likely going to be more predictable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=385.7s	385.7	 Virtually all puppies are energetic and playful at various times throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=389.7s	389.7	 But a smaller percentage of those dogs are going to remain highly energetic throughout
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=394.0s	394.0	 much of their life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=395.1s	395.1	 So you kind of know more about what you're getting, at least in terms of that dog's energy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=399.1s	399.1	 level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=400.1s	400.1	 So all of this means you have a higher likelihood of having a faster learning curve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=404.7s	404.7	 What are the downsides to having an older dog?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=407.2s	407.2	 There are no downsides to having an older dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=409.6s	409.6	 It's possible that a fully grown dog may have established unwanted habits like jumping,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=415.0s	415.0	 chewing, excessive barking, things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=417.4s	417.4	 Most of those are very superficial and easily addressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=419.9s	419.9	 I've got videos and books on all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=422.4s	422.4	 I will say it is important to use modern methods that do not include the use of aversive techniques.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=428.5s	428.5	 The evidence in ethology and animal behavior is that we don't need to use aversive techniques
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=433.8s	433.8	 to resolve those issues in any known case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=436.5s	436.5	 Always remember that as you're training your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=438.1s	438.1	 Then there's always the possibility that an older dog could have had negative experiences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=441.9s	441.9	 in their past that may make training a little bit more difficult or challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=447.0s	447.0	 But with the right commitment and flexibility on your part, you can give this dog a completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=451.6s	451.6	 new start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=452.6s	452.6	 If you're adopting a senior dog, it's possible they could have existing medical conditions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=456.0s	456.0	 that you'll need to contend with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=457.5s	457.5	 And it might be harder for dogs beyond the age of puppyhood to adapt to new environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=462.3s	462.3	 While you can probably get them to adapt to any environment, you need to be prepared to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=465.8s	465.8	 be patient and flexible in accomplishing that sometimes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=468.8s	468.8	 If your new home is so dramatically different than what they were used to, that can take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=473.1s	473.1	 some time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=474.4s	474.4	 Do you consider the context from which they came if you know it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=477.3s	477.3	 For example, some dogs could be grieving if they recently lost a guardian and that's why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=481.1s	481.1	 they're being re-homed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=482.1s	482.1	 It may take a little while to achieve a strong two-way bond.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=485.4s	485.4	 And even things as simple as housebreaking take a very proactive approach sometimes and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=489.8s	489.8	 getting them on our schedule and in tune with our routines.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=494.1s	494.1	 Very often with a fully developed dog comes a fully developed athlete too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=498.3s	498.3	 So matching the energy between the dog and the person is critical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=503.2s	503.2	 If you've done your due diligence with this dog, you'll hopefully have an idea of what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=506.9s	506.9	 their everyday energy level is like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=509.2s	509.2	 Not only do we want to consider the dog's genetics and their experiences if we're aware
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=513.4s	513.4	 of them, but we have to take into account that individual dog in the context in which
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=518.5s	518.5	 they are going to be living.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=520.2s	520.2	 It's such a good idea to reflect on all of these pros and cons before making this major
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=525.0s	525.0	 commitment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=526.0s	526.0	 What other pros and cons are there to young dogs versus older dogs?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=534.9s	534.9	 Novel experiences for dogs really hit different and can be extra exciting for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=538.9s	538.9	 So things like new dynamic toys or puzzles or things that really engage their brain and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=543.0s	543.0	 their senses can really help improve a dog's emotional state and keep them super engaged

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=556.2s	556.2	 Some dogs are really hard on toys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDMGV6AdCc&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=50&pp=iAQB&t=557.9s	557.9	 Super Chewer might be the better fit for them.
