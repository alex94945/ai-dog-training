https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Today I'm going to try to teach Inertia three more things that I've never taught any dog before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=5.8s	5.8	 I'm Zach George. I train dogs. This is my new dog and I'm going to show you how I trained her from day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=12.2s	12.2	 Things definitely won't always go smoothly. You can start from the beginning or you can pick up anywhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=17.8s	17.8	 Subscribe and hit the bell notification so you never miss an episode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=21.1s	21.1	 When you put into motion an approach based on love and respect, your results will forever remain in motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 This is Inertia. Welcome to the dog training experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 I love teaching Inertia a lot of different tricks. Setting a dog up for success with their training requires preparing them mentally and physically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 You're asking your dog to have sustained focus on sometimes challenging or difficult concepts, not to mention some tricks and stunts are physically demanding for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=48.6s	48.6	 So be sure you're using a top notch dog food for your dog. Solid Gold is one of the most premium foods you can get.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=55.7s	55.7	 They use whole superfood ingredients and their recipes have been carefully created to be super beneficial to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=61.5s	61.5	 They specialize in high end products for your dog. For example, this bone broth is actually human grade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=66.9s	66.9	 It's not only healthy for your dog, but it's great for picky eaters as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=70.6s	70.6	 This sea meal is made with actual seaweed. I mean, you can totally see it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=74.8s	74.8	 So if you want to get the best performance from your dog, give them great food and great supplements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 Check out Solid Gold's deal of the week just for you guys at solidgoldpet.com slash Zach. I'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=87.0s	87.0	 So I've got three tricks on tap today and my hope is to have some rough draft version by the end of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=94.2s	94.2	 It looks like Inertia is ready. So let's get started with trick number one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=97.9s	97.9	 As I go down this checklist of things that I want to train Inertia, I think it would be so awesome if I could put this cup of water on Inertia's head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=107.1s	107.1	 The version of the trick that I really like that I'm hoping we can get close to today is where I put it on her head and I'm able to actually pour water in it while it bounces on her head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=117.8s	117.8	 She's already looking skeptical. Why do I want to train this? I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 Now, I have worked on certain elements of this trick here and there, but this is actually going to be her first legit serious focused training session on this task.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 There's a new object here. I just want to let her know that's here. Let her smell it and check it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=136.2s	136.2	 Yes, and we have had like a similar version of this trick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 You might remember when we taught Inertia how to balance a treat on her nose, but this is a little different. What's this? Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 She's really good at holding that freeze position. That's something we've been working on for many months now, just in various situations where I just want her to like pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=155.1s	155.1	 So that's really good. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=160.7s	160.7	 Yes, good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=162.9s	162.9	 So she's pretty good with that. Now I want to get her comfortable balancing this cup on her head with water in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 Here, ready? Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=171.0s	171.0	 A little heavier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=172.9s	172.9	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=176.2s	176.2	 Okay, yes. Good girl. I'm super impressed with that. Her practice with balancing toys and treats and all of that is really coming in handy here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=185.4s	185.4	 She's really understanding this and she's really starting to generalize it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=188.9s	188.9	 Let's see if we can add some flash to this trick now. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=197.0s	197.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=200.5s	200.5	 Whoa! Oh gosh!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=205.4s	205.4	 Sorry, girl. That's why you want to use water. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=212.5s	212.5	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=217.8s	217.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=221.0s	221.0	 Okay, yes! Did you see that? I really pushed it there like she was thinking about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=225.5s	225.5	 oh my gosh, that's kind of weird. There's water coming on my head, but I don't feel it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 It's got to be an interesting sensation for her. Stay. Stay. Almost done. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=238.3s	238.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 Okay, yes! Good! Okay, good girl. Nice job. So I think we'll quit right there. That was a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=247.9s	247.9	 success for one training session. There is one lifelong goal that I have and that is to teach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=254.5s	254.5	 this next trick. I've never taught this before. It may prove too difficult, but we're going to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=259.3s	259.3	 give it a shot anyway. And the trick is the conga line. Okay, so the conga line is where your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=266.7s	266.7	 gets behind you, grabs you, and you know, does this walking dance with you. Of course, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=271.7s	271.7	 inertia knows paws up. She's really good at that. So let me see if I can get her to put her paws up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=277.1s	277.1	 on my back here. Paws up. Stay. And so that's pretty good. I can get her to do it without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=283.1s	283.1	 facing her and she's holding it. Okay, yes! There we go. Good job. Paws up. Stay. Now the tendency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=290.3s	290.3	 here would probably be to start walking because, you know, maybe your dog will walk with you, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=294.8s	294.8	 watch what might happen with your dog here. Let's see. See. Yes! Oh, that was, that was actually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=301.6s	301.6	 amazing. What? I actually was able to get some success doing that, but I could kind of feel her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=306.7s	306.7	 paws slipping. I think that moving forward, that might be a little less ideal. She can take a few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=311.6s	311.6	 steps like that, but then she inevitably is going to slip off. So I really want her to learn how to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=317.5s	317.5	 grab onto me while we walk so it's more stable for her. Paws up. Good. So we're going to lure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=323.9s	323.9	 her right here. Look at that. That's good. Yes. Let me see here. If I lure her with the treat over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=330.4s	330.4	 to the other side, I wonder, see that paw is perfect. And yes. Oh, good. Here. Yes. Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=341.8s	341.8	 Right now she's just totally grabbing on to my hips. This is so cool. I feel like if I walk right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 now, she would totally stay there. Stay. Yes. Good. Oh, that was excellent. That was our first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=354.7s	354.7	 really big breakthrough. Good job, girl. She was off to the side, but you can see she was holding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=359.6s	359.6	 on and we were walking together and that was some proper conga lining. Well, almost anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=366.4s	366.4	 What's proving to be more natural for her is to really try to grip one side of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=370.3s	370.3	 And that might be enough. I don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=371.7s	371.7	 Good girl. Very good. Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=381.1s	381.1	 Kick. Is that right? Kick. Good. Okay. I'm going to release her there. So I want her to know to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=387.4s	387.4	 only get down when I release her. Paws up. Yes. Come on. Let's go. I'm going to see if she just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=394.2s	394.2	 naturally grips. She is kind of. Yes. So I'm just going to take a few steps. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=406.6s	406.6	 Want her up there a little bit more. Stay and kick. Okay. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=419.8s	419.8	 Over here. There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=425.1s	425.1	 Okay. Super rough draft version accomplished. Okay. Good. I wonder if we can like take that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=432.3s	432.3	 to the next level now and see if she can do it a little bit better. You're doing great by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 Paws up. Even though this trick is obviously ridiculous, the great thing about it is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=441.6s	441.6	 she's getting mentally stimulated and she's learning to use her body in new ways. And so am I.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=447.0s	447.0	 I have no idea how we're going to teach her the kick, but we'll work on that later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=451.1s	451.1	 That was fun. Over time, we're going to continue to practice this trick and see if it's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=455.6s	455.6	 we enjoy doing. We'll keep you posted. For this next trick, we are going to attempt to go against
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=460.7s	460.7	 the laws of nature. Once they said mankind would never be able to fly or cars would never drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=466.7s	466.7	 themselves or that dogs wouldn't be able to hold a chicken leg or a hot dog in their mouth without
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=473.9s	473.9	 eating it. Now I've seen versions of this trick on the internet here and there over the years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=478.8s	478.8	 and it's pretty hilarious actually. And I'm willing to bet, even though I've never taught this before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=484.1s	484.1	 that it's a pretty easy trick to teach. I mean, really it's just kind of an advanced leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=489.4s	489.4	 Now when I brush inertia's teeth, she's used to me kind of holding her mouth here. And she's also
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=494.3s	494.3	 really good at freezing in position. Stay. Let go. Yes. Good job. Very good. So I'm guessing if I just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=504.1s	504.1	 position this food in her mouth, just like I would a toy or something else that I might have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=507.9s	507.9	 worked on in the past, that she ought to be able to simply hold it. If I ask her to stay here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=513.3s	513.3	 good girl. Stay. Let go. Yeah. Good girl. Because I've really prioritized my communication with her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEa9vV1lBhg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=262&pp=iAQB&t=522.7s	522.7	 in other words, telling her to stay in a variety of situations, how to leave things alone,
