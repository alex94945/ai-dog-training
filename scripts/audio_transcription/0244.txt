https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 So far, she doesn't really seem to be getting the concept of walking on a leash right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=4.1s	4.1	 How many of you deal with this with your puppy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=6.4s	6.4	 I'm Zach George.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=7.3s	7.3	 I'm a dog trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=8.3s	8.3	 Meet my new project, Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=10.2s	10.2	 I've got just three weeks to train her and set her up for the most well-behaved life possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=14.5s	14.5	 That means I need to work on the most common puppy issues like potty training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=17.8s	17.8	 how to actually pay attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=19.4s	19.4	 stopping things like play biting, chewing, separation anxiety,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=23.0s	23.0	 getting along with other animals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=24.6s	24.6	 leash walking and teaching her everything a good dog needs to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 Real dog training doesn't always go smoothly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=30.2s	30.2	 and that's why I'm going to show you every success and mistake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=33.6s	33.6	 and how I work through all the most challenging parts of raising a new puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=37.4s	37.4	 Welcome to your new puppy survival guide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=42.2s	42.2	 I've been continuing to work with Kona on actually going to sleep while in her crate overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=47.5s	47.5	 And as you can see, as soon as I walk out of sight with Kona,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=50.7s	50.7	 it's apparent that she's definitely more anxious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=53.9s	53.9	 She immediately starts vocalizing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=55.9s	55.9	 This is really representative of the nuanced moments in training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 where you really have to be patient and understanding with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=63.2s	63.2	 In this situation, there are both pros and cons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=65.6s	65.6	 to letting Kona express her anxiety for a period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 And the same is true if I let her out of her crate too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=71.3s	71.3	 But in this case, I feel like Kona's anxiety isn't so severe,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=75.2s	75.2	 and I think I can test for 10 or 15 minutes or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=78.5s	78.5	 But if Kona is still barking after 15 minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=80.7s	80.7	 this is when I reconsider letting her out to pee or have some water
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=84.1s	84.1	 or maybe offer her some extra food or a great dog chew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=87.7s	87.7	 Well, Kona still seemed pretty upset after 15 minutes in this case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=91.7s	91.7	 And to be fair, it is only her third night here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=94.6s	94.6	 So I did elect to sleep downstairs to hopefully help her feel more comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=98.4s	98.4	 Knowing when to let your dog cry and when to give in and let them out or sleep with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=102.3s	102.3	 requires a lot of testing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=103.8s	103.8	 And this is how you do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 So you guys saw how last night went.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=106.9s	106.9	 I mean, it didn't exactly go as planned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=109.3s	109.3	 And it's important to remain flexible at all times when you're training a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=113.9s	113.9	 because dog training in its purest form is catering to the individual dog that you're working with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 I thought it would be good to sleep on the couch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=121.0s	121.0	 because the last two nights I was sleeping right here on a mattress,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=124.1s	124.1	 this puts me a little bit farther away and she seemed to do fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=127.4s	127.4	 So I consider even that progress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=129.6s	129.6	 I was just trying to take a step that was too big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=132.5s	132.5	 Another thing that's been proving very useful is the Furbo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=135.5s	135.5	 You can see we've had it set up there since day one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=138.6s	138.6	 If you're wondering about the bark alerts, let me assure you they work very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=142.6s	142.6	 And these were just from last night.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=145.0s	145.0	 You can see you can select all the barking shots, the continuous barking shots.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=148.5s	148.5	 Check this out though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=149.4s	149.4	 Look, the howling shot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=153.0s	153.0	 Hear that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=154.5s	154.5	 It just trips me out how Furbo knows the difference between barking and howling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=159.4s	159.4	 But you can see they're a really clear example of her anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=162.5s	162.5	 And moving forward, I know Furbo is going to be very beneficial to us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=165.4s	165.4	 because as I am able to get upstairs and monitor her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=169.0s	169.0	 it'll give me more information on what to do and how to proceed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=171.7s	171.7	 I'm going to distribute a treat here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=173.4s	173.4	 I'm just going to press this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=176.1s	176.1	 See if it gets her attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=178.8s	178.8	 What's that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=181.5s	181.5	 Look at all those treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=183.0s	183.0	 There are so many creative ways to use this feature in your training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=186.2s	186.2	 I'm going to have a link in the description where you can pick one up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 Leash walking is an essential skill for our dogs,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=193.0s	193.0	 but it's far from natural for them to understand how to behave when they're on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=198.0s	198.0	 In general, dogs aren't used to always being within four or six feet of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 that the leash requires them to be in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=204.8s	204.8	 For example, there she is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=207.8s	207.8	 Kona!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=210.2s	210.2	 She's doing great there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=212.9s	212.9	 But when a dog is on the leash and they're not used to it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=215.0s	215.0	 they very often will lag behind and get fixated on something on the ground
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=218.6s	218.6	 or they'll pull ahead or try and get at any number of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=221.8s	221.8	 In other words, it's not really intuitive for them to just walk next to us really nicely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=227.0s	227.0	 So we have to teach them that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=228.2s	228.2	 The first time that we put a leash on a dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=231.0s	231.0	 don't just assume they're going to be accepting of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=233.3s	233.3	 I think Kona is going to be pretty good here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=235.2s	235.2	 You just want to place it on there and let them get used to wearing the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=238.6s	238.6	 They can even walk around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=240.3s	240.3	 You see she's even chewing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=241.7s	241.7	 I don't like that, but I'm going to pick my battles here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=243.7s	243.7	 It's more important that she not be nervous of the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=247.0s	247.0	 If you come on too strong with a leash, you're likely to scare your dog a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=250.6s	250.6	 It's always best to avoid that if we can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=252.5s	252.5	 Just for good measure, make sure they're comfortable dragging it around like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 You can see she's not thrown off by that in the slightest, so we're pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=259.8s	259.8	 Let's see how she does when there's tension applied to the leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=263.7s	263.7	 because they're often going to lunge and pull.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=265.7s	265.7	 But see, if we introduce the concept of tension, yes, in a really mild way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=270.4s	270.4	 we can ease them into the fact that, hey, sometimes there's going to be tension,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=273.9s	273.9	 especially with a puppy because you guys are crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=277.8s	277.8	 There we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=278.7s	278.7	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=279.5s	279.5	 Watch what I'm doing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=281.1s	281.1	 I'm just giving a little bit of tension and giving her a treat saying, hey, look,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=284.7s	284.7	 tension happens. No big deal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=290.8s	290.8	 to be very rambunctious and experience it, and I don't want it to scare her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=294.2s	294.2	 The leash is not a tool for actually training your dog or providing a negative consequence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=298.8s	298.8	 but it's just a way to easily control your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=301.4s	301.4	 The first leash walking session with any dog should be in an indoor familiar environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=306.2s	306.2	 That's why we're here in my living room right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=308.2s	308.2	 The reason we want to be indoors is that it's a lot less distracting than outdoors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=313.4s	313.4	 We want to make first lessons as easy as possible in everything that we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=317.8s	317.8	 You might remember in our last lesson, we focused on, look at me, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=321.4s	321.4	 Here, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=322.6s	322.6	 Leash walking is essentially, look at me while we walk around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=326.2s	326.2	 I generally want to make sure that I can get her attention on me while we're moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=329.5s	329.5	 That's what we're trying to teach, this very basic concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=332.7s	332.7	 You can see right off the bat, she's already pulling ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=335.8s	335.8	 My objective is to get her paying attention to me just while we walk around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=339.8s	339.8	 Kona, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=342.2s	342.2	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=343.0s	343.0	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=344.6s	344.6	 Great start.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 Just trying to see if I can get her into a natural flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=349.6s	349.6	 I don't want to pull her along.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=351.0s	351.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=351.8s	351.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=353.9s	353.9	 Here, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=355.0s	355.0	 Every time she bites at the leash like that, I'm just going to encourage her to look at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=359.0s	359.0	 and let go of the leash just by holding up the treat or making a high-pitched voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=363.1s	363.1	 or getting her attention in some happy way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=365.8s	365.8	 She looks a little bored right now, doesn't she?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=368.1s	368.1	 Like she doesn't seem like she really wants to do a leash walking session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=370.8s	370.8	 So I've got a couple of options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=372.7s	372.7	 I guess I could take a break, but I don't want to do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=377.0s	377.0	 I'm in the mood to train you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=379.0s	379.0	 So let me see if I can inspire her to go along with this lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 I like that, man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=383.8s	383.8	 See the value of play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=385.3s	385.3	 You can see how she's just lit up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=387.1s	387.1	 She doesn't seem quite as bored.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=389.0s	389.0	 Food isn't the only kind of currency for a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=391.9s	391.9	 Play, like this, can serve as a way to reward your dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=395.2s	395.2	 but we want to be really strategic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=397.0s	397.0	 So ideally, we work up to three to five second sessions of tug of war
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=401.4s	401.4	 or a single toss of the toy and bringing it back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=404.0s	404.0	 so that we can keep the training session going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=405.8s	405.8	 Come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=407.1s	407.1	 Good, right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=407.9s	407.9	 Look at that nice little trot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=411.9s	411.9	 Come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=414.3s	414.3	 Just using the toy to kind of signal her along, getting that eye line up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=418.3s	418.3	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=419.4s	419.4	 Go ahead and let her chase the toy for a second, get some engagement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=423.3s	423.3	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=424.8s	424.8	 Maybe I'll let her play with it a little extra long here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=427.3s	427.3	 since it's a new concept for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=430.2s	430.2	 Good, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=433.0s	433.0	 Nice job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=434.3s	434.3	 What?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=436.1s	436.1	 Good, okay, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=439.0s	439.0	 Yes, look at you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=441.5s	441.5	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=444.5s	444.5	 Easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=445.8s	445.8	 I want to be really careful not to reward the jumping,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=448.8s	448.8	 and so I really am only going to reward good leash walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=453.1s	453.1	 You can see she's used to getting treated for lie down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=455.7s	455.7	 so she's like, hey, maybe that'll get me what I want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=458.2s	458.2	 Come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=458.8s	458.8	 So far, she doesn't really seem to be getting the concept
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=461.4s	461.4	 of walking on a leash right now, but she does like playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=465.0s	465.0	 So, I mean, this is normal, you know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=466.6s	466.6	 Leash walking sessions can be bumpy like this, especially when they're new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=469.9s	469.9	 All I'm doing here is looking for opportunities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=472.0s	472.0	 to acknowledge general attention or eye contact.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=478.6s	478.6	 Look at that, look at the look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=479.8s	479.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=482.3s	482.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=484.2s	484.2	 So right there, I got her to look up at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=485.9s	485.9	 and make that turn while we were walking on a leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=488.2s	488.2	 Wanted to let her know there were good things coming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=490.3s	490.3	 after she complied with that request.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=494.1s	494.1	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=495.8s	495.8	 Kona.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=498.7s	498.7	 Okay, I'm struggling a little bit here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=500.2s	500.2	 and I'm not really getting the steady focus I was hoping for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=503.8s	503.8	 Kona, come on, keep moving, keep moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=506.7s	506.7	 Here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=507.8s	507.8	 When I get more peppy, she does too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=509.6s	509.6	 but that also increases her playful leash biting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=512.7s	512.7	 Ultimately, I want her eyes off of that leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=515.0s	515.0	 and onto me during training like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=517.0s	517.0	 Here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=521.8s	521.8	 Every time she goes for that leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=524.0s	524.0	 Kona, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=525.7s	525.7	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=529.0s	529.0	 Let me see if she wants a treat now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=530.5s	530.5	 We can always mix it up, see what she prefers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=534.2s	534.2	 Kona, come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=545.9s	545.9	 I'm gonna look for moments where she's looking up at me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=549.3s	549.3	 and not jumping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=550.3s	550.3	 Yes, just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=551.5s	551.5	 I love that little prance that she's doing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=560.2s	560.2	 Come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=565.1s	565.1	 inside the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=566.1s	566.1	 It is orders of magnitude more difficult to teach a dog to walk like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=570.4s	570.4	 in an outdoor or public environment than it is inside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=573.9s	573.9	 That's because their senses are just overwhelmed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=576.6s	576.6	 especially as young dogs when they go to a new place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=579.9s	579.9	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=580.7s	580.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=581.7s	581.7	 Good, and I'm pairing the word here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=583.4s	583.4	 which you could say, look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=584.7s	584.7	 You could say, watch me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=585.8s	585.8	 Whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=586.2s	586.2	 I mean, those attention-getting words can be used in different contexts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=590.1s	590.1	 however you want to use them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=591.5s	591.5	 So I'm getting sustained attention here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=594.2s	594.2	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=598.7s	598.7	 but the outdoors can be way more challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=601.6s	601.6	 I'm going to give Kona a break,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=602.9s	602.9	 and then let's take her outside and see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=605.8s	605.8	 Now, before we do this next leash walking lesson,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=609.4s	609.4	 let's go give her a potty break.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=613.0s	613.0	 She's been taking a nap for a little while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=616.9s	616.9	 It's not good enough to work on one thing at a time, really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=619.6s	619.6	 We're working on many things simultaneously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=623.7s	623.7	 Go pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=625.7s	625.7	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=628.1s	628.1	 Let's put that leash on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=629.5s	629.5	 Like, before we're going to get her warmed up with a look at me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=631.8s	631.8	 I didn't even have to ask for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=633.9s	633.9	 You're just that smart, aren't you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=635.8s	635.8	 Good job, girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=637.7s	637.7	 Can you give me a stand?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=639.3s	639.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=640.2s	640.2	 Good work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=641.7s	641.7	 Love it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=646.0s	646.0	 Can we get it down?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=647.9s	647.9	 Yep, we sure can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=649.3s	649.3	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=651.0s	651.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=651.7s	651.7	 Good work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=654.5s	654.5	 because this is going to be an easier environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=657.0s	657.0	 Even though it's outdoors, it's an easier outdoor environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=659.8s	659.8	 than going to a big city where she hasn't been, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=662.6s	662.6	 She's spent a lot of time out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=664.0s	664.0	 She's quite familiar with this particular outdoor environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=666.8s	666.8	 but all outdoor environments are not equal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=669.0s	669.0	 I like her energy right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=670.6s	670.6	 I don't really care which side she walks on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=672.9s	672.9	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=676.0s	676.0	 hey, what's going on?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=676.9s	676.9	 I want to walk with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=678.4s	678.4	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=680.2s	680.2	 And so, I mean, do you see her general willingness right here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=683.2s	683.2	 to pay attention how she's looking over there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=685.3s	685.3	 Now she's looking up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=687.8s	687.8	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=691.6s	691.6	 That's a good sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=693.5s	693.5	 I mean, that's the thing about leash walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=694.9s	694.9	 You just want them paying attention to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=696.5s	696.5	 instead of everything around them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=697.8s	697.8	 And that's why you want to keep the environment really easy at first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=700.5s	700.5	 because puppies are very curious beings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=703.4s	703.4	 and will easily get distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=706.6s	706.6	 Wow, look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=709.0s	709.0	 And here I'm able to get some sustained walking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=711.1s	711.1	 I'm going to try to turn around and see what she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=713.4s	713.4	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=724.2s	724.2	 Let's see what happens when we change textures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=726.0s	726.0	 and walk on the grass here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=727.0s	727.0	 How does she do there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=728.2s	728.2	 A little more distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=729.8s	729.8	 I mean, the smell of grass is very enticing to dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=732.8s	732.8	 Hey, Kona.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=735.6s	735.6	 See how she's lagging behind all of a sudden?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=737.2s	737.2	 Just changing the texture can make a huge difference.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=740.0s	740.0	 Kona.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=745.5s	745.5	 So if your dog was lagging behind or they got fixated on something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=748.2s	748.2	 just be patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=749.0s	749.0	 Wait it out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=787.1s	787.1	 Leave the grass alone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=803.1s	803.1	 All right, so I'm going to see if I can keep the walk advancing towards the fence here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=811.7s	811.7	 Come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=817.8s	817.8	 So I am coaxing her with the tree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=819.3s	819.3	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=834.0s	834.0	 See here she's like saying, okay, I want to go over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=836.8s	836.8	 But right now we're doing a lesson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=838.0s	838.0	 So we're going to try and keep her focused on me so we can continue on the way that I want to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=842.3s	842.3	 So now we're seeing tension on the leash.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=846.8s	846.8	 Much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=849.5s	849.5	 Here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=860.4s	860.4	 I mean dogs are sensitive to surfaces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=864.3s	864.3	 Come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=885.6s	885.6	 They just lie down and they don't want to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=888.0s	888.0	 Pretty normal for a puppy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=889.5s	889.5	 I think this was a good introductory leash session for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=892.5s	892.5	 We'll continue to work on it and see how she does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=895.6s	895.6	 You know I couldn't help but introduce Kona to the frisbee right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=900.3s	900.3	 She's been watching inertia play and she seems to be kind of interested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=903.3s	903.3	 when we're out here goofing off with the frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=905.3s	905.3	 When you're getting your dog interested in a new toy or frisbee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=908.0s	908.0	 the first thing to do is to make it really interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=911.2s	911.2	 Sometimes that can be a little tougher with a thing like a frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=913.7s	913.7	 There's no squeaker on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=915.6s	915.6	 It's just a piece of plastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=917.0s	917.0	 Right now I'm just trying to spark the flint here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=919.3s	919.3	 Just trying to get a fire going.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=920.8s	920.8	 You can see it's a little tough right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=923.2s	923.2	 She's not in the most frisbee-minded point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=925.9s	925.9	 So we'll keep trying on that and see if that interest in that drive intensifies over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=930.9s	930.9	 The idea is to get her tracking it while it rolls on the ground just like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=934.0s	934.0	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=937.3s	937.3	 Really we're just trying to increase general interest.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=943.6s	943.6	 The idea we're really trying to...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=953.8s	953.8	 Of course she's got those puppy teeth, but she's got a good tug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2_Gdhc7CQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=245&pp=iAQB&t=957.6s	957.6	 Really good tug for a puppy.
