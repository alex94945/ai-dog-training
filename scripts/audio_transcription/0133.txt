https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 I wanted to show you how good our dog Inertia is in the meantime so you can see what we're working towards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 Come on, come. You know the drill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=12.0s	12.0	 Now I'm not saying that our dog Inertia loves having her teeth brushed, but she is extremely tolerant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 Even to this day with Inertia, I still go really slowly with her. I don't want to force this upon her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=25.0s	25.0	 You really have to read your dog well when doing sensitive things like this, whether it's clipping their nails or brushing their teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=30.0s	30.0	 Also take note of how I'm not really restraining her. I think so many of us wait until our dog is in the position of having to have their teeth brushed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=38.0s	38.0	 Like we're on a schedule and we need to get it done really quick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 There we go. Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 It's important to really set up these sessions in the way that we are with Veronica right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 Super low key and understanding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcgaKBlQcQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=134&pp=iAQB&t=50.0s	50.0	 Good job.
