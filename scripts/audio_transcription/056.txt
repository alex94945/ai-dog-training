https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=26.1s	26.1	 I'm thrilled that NomNom is the sponsor of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=29.0s	29.0	 We've been waiting for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=30.5s	30.5	 The way that we train our dogs isn't the only thing that goes into how they're feeling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=33.9s	33.9	 when they're being trained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=34.9s	34.9	 Completely frozen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=35.9s	35.9	 They arrive like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=36.9s	36.9	 So you put them in your freezer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 Here's two legit reasons that using fresh food can possibly make your training more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=41.5s	41.5	 successful and easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=43.0s	43.0	 One, high quality fresh foods tend to have more complex carbohydrates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=46.6s	46.6	 Those help maintain steady blood sugar levels throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=49.6s	49.6	 Two, fresh foods usually have higher levels of that really good stuff, the omega-3 and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=53.7s	53.7	 6 fatty acids, which help produce serotonin and dopamine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=57.6s	57.6	 Those are excellent dog training brain chemicals to have presence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=60.9s	60.9	 Those neurotransmitters help regulate your dog's mood, their happiness, and relaxation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=65.0s	65.0	 And NomNom makes this fresh food that's optimized specifically for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=69.4s	69.4	 It's all pre-portioned and ready to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=71.1s	71.1	 And even if you don't want to commit to feeding it full-time, you can integrate it into your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=74.4s	74.4	 dog's regular diet so that they get some fresh food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=76.9s	76.9	 NomNom is going to give you half off a two-week trial so that you can really try this food
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=81.7s	81.7	 and see if it's for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=83.0s	83.0	 You have to use my special link, trinom.com slash Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=87.1s	87.1	 I'll have a link in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=88.6s	88.6	 We've been steadily seeing Veronica improve more and more on frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=92.2s	92.2	 One of the great things that I love about frisbee is that it's a good way to get them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=96.0s	96.0	 thinking in different ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=97.2s	97.2	 So I'm hoping today to teach her something that we call multiples.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=102.8s	102.8	 I like this energy right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=104.4s	104.4	 Multiple segment, as they call it in the sport of dog frisbee, is where you rapidly deliver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 one frisbee after the other and your dog catches it, let's go, catches it, let's go, and hopefully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=114.7s	114.7	 catches it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=115.7s	115.7	 I have a feeling that she's ready for this, but let me get her a little warmed up first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=118.7s	118.7	 just to get her in the mood to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=120.8s	120.8	 Get those brain chemicals working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 Get it, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=123.3s	123.3	 I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=124.3s	124.3	 The first thing is with multiples is that you want to be able to throw a frisbee in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 place, kind of like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=130.1s	130.1	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=130.9s	130.9	 Hey, I'm trying to show them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 And there's probably more than one way to throw this, but you know, I mean, you could
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=135.8s	135.8	 just deliver it like that as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=139.3s	139.3	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=140.1s	140.1	 The point is that multiples are generally very close and they happen fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=143.9s	143.9	 So in general, with multiples, you're throwing them in rapid succession quickly and you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 doing it at close range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=149.6s	149.6	 So there's not a lot of decision time for your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 See this chomping right here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=153.2s	153.2	 She can't fixate on a frisbee like this during a multiple segment or she'll miss the next
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=156.6s	156.6	 throw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=157.6s	157.6	 So I want to start real slow and make this easy for her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=160.9s	160.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=162.9s	162.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=163.9s	163.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=164.9s	164.9	 That might even be an easier way rather than going straight to the throw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=168.6s	168.6	 So catch it, let go, catch it, let go, catch it, let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=172.9s	172.9	 But I'm trying to keep it less boring by throwing those rollers in there like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=177.2s	177.2	 giving her a chance to run and chase something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 She really finds value in that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=181.2s	181.2	 She loves doing that like a lot of frisbee dogs do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=184.7s	184.7	 So hopefully that's the light bulb starting to go off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=187.6s	187.6	 So here, stay, catch it, let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=193.5s	193.5	 Let her figure it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=195.6s	195.6	 Inside out, let her think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=196.6s	196.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=197.6s	197.6	 Catch it, let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=199.6s	199.6	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 Even though she missed the last one, you can see she's starting to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=204.2s	204.2	 Catch it, let go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 A good girl, man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 She's a natural at this, isn't she?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=214.0s	214.0	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=219.0s	219.0	 I'm going to let her reason it out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=221.7s	221.7	 I don't like that chomping.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=223.2s	223.2	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=229.0s	229.0	 Did you notice how in the second one she chomped on it a lot less?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=232.3s	232.3	 Catch it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=239.3s	239.3	 But this is another good way to teach your dog how to think, how to use their brain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=242.5s	242.5	 how to problem solve, which will cross over into so many other areas of your communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=248.0s	248.0	 Now stay with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 Bree video logged her training session with Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=252.4s	252.4	 We're going to work on come and stay with distractions on the California coast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=256.5s	256.5	 Why don't we all judge her together and see what we like and what we might have done differently?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=262.0s	262.0	 I love how Bree is warming up Veronica with this really easy stay at close range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=267.1s	267.1	 That really starts off the training session perfectly because Veronica is succeeding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=271.2s	271.2	 And the way that you stretch before you work out, this is what you do when you start a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=274.4s	274.4	 training session like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=275.7s	275.7	 And she continues to go farther and farther away with each rep after that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=278.6s	278.6	 And this is a well established training drill for these two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=281.7s	281.7	 But the aim here is to rehearse something that Veronica knows stay, but in a completely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=286.6s	286.6	 different place.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=293.8s	293.8	 I'm trying not to say yes, so I'm really close because I'm afraid she's jump up and run to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=297.8s	297.8	 me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=301.8s	301.8	 Veronica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=302.8s	302.8	 Give me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=305.8s	305.8	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=308.8s	308.8	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=309.8s	309.8	 Now I know a lot of dog trainers don't like the idea of calling your dog from a stay like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=315.6s	315.6	 this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=316.6s	316.6	 And I think there's a lot of validity to that, particularly in the beginning when you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=319.7s	319.7	 training this skill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=321.4s	321.4	 Come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=322.4s	322.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=324.0s	324.0	 Come for a frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 But as time goes on, you want your dog to come to you under a variety of different circumstances,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=330.5s	330.5	 whether they're in a stay at distance or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=333.1s	333.1	 So it's still good to practice both.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=335.0s	335.0	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=336.6s	336.6	 I love how Bree is mixing it up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=338.5s	338.5	 Is using the power of play to teach Veronica?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=340.8s	340.8	 Oh no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=341.8s	341.8	 Off the cliff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=342.8s	342.8	 That's a pretty good example of an emergency stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=345.0s	345.0	 My frisbee just went off the cliff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=346.5s	346.5	 So I had to use my emergency long lead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=349.5s	349.5	 Frisbee retrieved.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=351.5s	351.5	 The goal of doing silly things like this is to make sure our dogs will listen when we're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=356.5s	356.5	 not acting in that traditional role of I'm a dog trainer teaching you right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=361.6s	361.6	 Yes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=363.6s	363.6	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=364.6s	364.6	 You did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=366.8s	366.8	 On a scale of 1 to 10, how reliable is your dog's stay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=369.1s	369.1	 10 being super reliable.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=372.4s	372.4	 Oh, a kitty cat.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=374.9s	374.9	 We get to see some of that real world training in action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=377.1s	377.1	 There's a cat right there on the side of the road.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=379.8s	379.8	 Veronica notices the cat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=381.4s	381.4	 In this case, Bree opts to try to keep Veronica moving because they're on a busy road and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=385.9s	385.9	 she doesn't want her to get too distracted.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=391.1s	391.1	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=399.8s	399.8	 Good girl.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=413.0s	413.0	 There's value in giving your dog experiences rather than saying stop this or stop that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=417.7s	417.7	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=418.7s	418.7	 What would your dog do on a walk if they encountered a cat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=421.0s	421.0	 Would they pay attention to you or would they get fixated on the cat?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=423.9s	423.9	 Most of our dogs are pretty energetic dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=426.2s	426.2	 Veronica's learning some of inertia's habits I see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=429.2s	429.2	 We're down here for about 20 minutes on the beach playing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=442.6s	442.6	 Really have to show them how to play the game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=453.8s	453.8	 Give them exercise early in the day, then go focus on your work, let them recover.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=461.6s	461.6	 love attention.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=467.4s	467.4	 public is concerned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=468.5s	468.5	 Give them outlets to do things that they find natural but in acceptable and productive ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=473.5s	473.5	 Our dogs like to dig on the beach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=475.4s	475.4	 That's fun.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=476.4s	476.4	 They like to run around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=477.4s	477.4	 They like to chase balls and frisbees.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=479.7s	479.7	 They love playing fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=481.4s	481.4	 That gives them an acceptable outlet to run after something, chase it, grab it, bite it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=486.2s	486.2	 bring it back to you, play tug of war, whatever they like doing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=492.1s	492.1	 I found this trail of weird tracks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=495.3s	495.3	 These experiences might seem insignificant to you at first, but this allows your dog to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=502.3s	502.3	 Hopefully whatever made those tracks overnight has already moved on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=505.5s	505.5	 And to see Veronica zone in on them and really use her nose to figure out what happened on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=509.9s	509.9	 the beach overnight while we were gone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=515.0s	515.0	 And as soon as Veronica sniffed it, she got so interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=518.0s	518.0	 Things that obviously smell amazing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=524.3s	524.3	 Uh oh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=525.3s	525.3	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=526.3s	526.3	 The rollers are a guaranteed way to get her to run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=529.9s	529.9	 She goes after a roller every time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=532.1s	532.1	 She can't resist them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=533.1s	533.1	 And sometimes she refuses a throw.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=535.2s	535.2	 I don't want to rack up those refusals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=537.4s	537.4	 Three makes an excellent point about the refusals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=540.0s	540.0	 We really want to condition our dogs to play with us when their mood is aligned with what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=543.4s	543.4	 we want to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=544.4s	544.4	 In other words, we don't want our dogs to just play fetch if they don't want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=547.8s	547.8	 I find a dog's desire to play fetch increases over time the more they play it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=552.8s	552.8	 And rolling those discs still gives Veronica the chance to run and chase and bite stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=558.0s	558.0	 One of the reasons I teach heel on both sides is that I want an earthshed to be able to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=562.5s	562.5	 stay between me and the road and not pull anything crazy because she gets startled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=568.5s	568.5	 by a car.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=569.5s	569.5	 I used right heel coming here and I'll be using left heel going back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=573.1s	573.1	 You can see a car way in the distance approaching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=576.1s	576.1	 You don't have room to pull over if your dog starts freaking out because a car passes at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=580.4s	580.4	 kind of close range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=582.1s	582.1	 That's not what we want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=583.1s	583.1	 It almost kind of reminds me of Stand By Me when they had to get across the railroad track
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=586.7s	586.7	 bridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=587.7s	587.7	 This is a really good application of heel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=590.8s	590.8	 That's where they stay to one side of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=592.4s	592.4	 I've taught inertia both a left heel and a right heel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=595.0s	595.0	 It really pays off that we've been working on heel at various speeds as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=599.2s	599.2	 That way I could minimize our time being vulnerable on the bridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=602.5s	602.5	 Bridges are certainly an oddity to many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=605.8s	605.8	 So encountering them is unusual, it would seem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=610.2s	610.2	 Tell me if you're interested in a video that focuses on the overview of how to train a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=614.9s	614.9	 Anything that could affect training dogs I want to be aware of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=618.2s	618.2	 At least that's what the dog trainer inside of me says.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=621.0s	621.0	 Brie's shown such interest in snipping these mounds around here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=625.3s	625.3	 I'm not sure, I really don't know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=626.6s	626.6	 I've got to do some research here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=628.2s	628.2	 I'm at a true conundrum here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=630.0s	630.0	 I think we need to bring in the scientific method here and continue to observe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=633.7s	633.7	 I've trained inertia around so many different things at this point and so many types of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=638.9s	638.9	 animals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=639.9s	639.9	 And Brie said she discovered three new ones overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=643.3s	643.3	 See these are the mounds that popped up overnight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=646.8s	646.8	 So imagine as the dirt gets churned up, there's fresher smells there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=651.0s	651.0	 There might be some type of nighttime animal and inertia has been really even more than
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=656.1s	656.1	 normal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=674.9s	674.9	 There's only one catch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=676.0s	676.0	 I have to work in this area knowing that there are animals centimeters below the surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=681.6s	681.6	 So I have her on lead just in case something catches our attention and starts running across
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=686.1s	686.1	 the ground really fast.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=692.7s	692.7	 There are some vulnerabilities in this environment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=703.1s	703.1	 Any number of things could happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=704.4s	704.4	 There's no fences around here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=705.8s	705.8	 We've encountered a lot of these types of situations as we travel, especially new types

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=726.0s	726.0	 Make a mountain out of a mole hill.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=731.4s	731.4	 You know, that's a mole hill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=732.4s	732.4	 You don't want to make a mountain out of a tiny mole hill.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=737.5s	737.5	 After some research by science officer Bree, I believe we were dealing with an animal like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=742.4s	742.4	 this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=744.4s	744.4	 At least the dogs now have an understanding of what animals like this might smell like,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=754.5s	754.5	 This is a question I'm dying to know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=756.2s	756.2	 What is the most unexpected distraction you've ever encountered with your dog in public?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=760.9s	760.9	 Or what about the most unexpected animal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=763.3s	763.3	 You look good out there, Sandvace.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=766.4s	766.4	 Look what you've done now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=768.4s	768.4	 Just when I thought she couldn't get any dirtier.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=778.5s	778.5	 How did she get so clean so quick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=780.1s	780.1	 Maybe another throw will get her cleaner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=781.9s	781.9	 Go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=786.9s	786.9	 Alright, let's see what the verdict is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=788.9s	788.9	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=789.9s	789.9	 Alright, self-cleaning dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=792.2s	792.2	 We were giving the dogs another round of exercise and I threw the ball pretty far and noticed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=796.0s	796.0	 that inertia was pretty much dead center between me and her mom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=801.0s	801.0	 And she started to look at mom and Veronica as if to say, I think I'll go over there with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItwbJ0pOsQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=57&pp=iAQB&t=804.4s	804.4	 them.
