https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=5.0s	5.0	 This is Reality Dog Training.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=18.2s	18.2	 From everything I've seen, Inersha and Chop are ready to meet each other again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=22.8s	22.8	 And hopefully this time they'll open up a little bit more than they did when they first

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=27.4s	27.4	 Inersha is sensitive, but she is brave enough and there comes a time to test.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 And I think now is that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=33.8s	33.8	 During times like this, I like to eat some nom nom to think about things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=37.9s	37.9	 Now I know what you're thinking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=40.0s	40.0	 There's no way they ship nom nom to Alaska.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 You're right about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=45.3s	45.3	 Sorry Alaska.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 The thing is, nom nom is super fresh food so they have to get it where it's going fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=51.8s	51.8	 And apparently dog sledding the product takes a little bit too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=55.4s	55.4	 Hopefully someday though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=56.5s	56.5	 This stuff is so fresh and so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=58.6s	58.6	 It's designed by a veterinary nutritionist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 They actually cater it to your specific dog and gently cook the food so it retains so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 many of its nutrients.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=78.9s	78.9	 I'll have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=80.4s	80.4	 I'm hoping that today Inersha and Chop might actually become friends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=85.4s	85.4	 This is one of the more significant moments in Inersha's life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=88.9s	88.9	 At least as it relates to interacting with a young, strong, big other dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=94.1s	94.1	 He had such an active day yesterday and he basically woke up after spending 10 plus hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=99.5s	99.5	 asleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=100.5s	100.5	 And he still looked pretty tired and pretty subdued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=104.1s	104.1	 So I'm looking at him and I'm like, this is the mindset I want him in when he interacts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=108.5s	108.5	 with Inersha.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=109.5s	109.5	 Not high strung like he was at the park yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=111.5s	111.5	 And it's worth reminding you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=113.0s	113.0	 Inersha has demonstrated fearful behavior in the past where she's felt the need to nip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=117.7s	117.7	 at other dogs and it's fortunately not accelerated, but I want to keep it that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=122.1s	122.1	 But Inersha has also come a long way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=124.0s	124.0	 She's matured tremendously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=125.6s	125.6	 Her training has been going very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=127.5s	127.5	 And so I really think that these two have a very good shot at hitting it off well together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=134.3s	134.3	 Of all the things that Inersha and I have done together, the trust we've built with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=137.6s	137.6	 one another has probably been one of the things that I'm at least most proud of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=141.3s	141.3	 I don't want to mess that up and I don't think I'm going to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=143.7s	143.7	 At the end of the day, you never know how two dogs are going to interact with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 There's a lot of variables and we can't know exactly what's going on in their head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 All we can do is do our best to prepare them for these interactions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=155.5s	155.5	 I brought my dog Inersha outside and both dogs seem pretty calm and in a good mood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=160.4s	160.4	 And I'm feeling pretty good about this, but let's see if this goes as I expect it to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=165.4s	165.4	 I just like letting the dogs come out here when I'm doing this type of training and have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 their dog time together and let them get their fresh air.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=175.7s	175.7	 Wake up a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=187.9s	187.9	 And there we have it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=188.9s	188.9	 I mean, let's let this play out for a little bit and see where they go with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=192.4s	192.4	 So far, so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=208.8s	208.8	 Is their first game of chase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=221.6s	221.6	 You see a brief moment of cautiousness here from inertia and she appears to be communicating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 to chop settle down for a second and chop takes that cue from her extremely well and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=232.1s	232.1	 he backs off for a few seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=234.7s	234.7	 It's pretty good at chase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=235.7s	235.7	 I'd say so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=236.7s	236.7	 And inertia is going to be super happy now that that's her favorite dog game right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=242.9s	242.9	 Some dogs like to wrestle, but inertia loves to play chase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 That's her favorite game to play with other dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=249.8s	249.8	 Chop is behaving extremely well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=251.5s	251.5	 He's even ignoring inertia sometimes, which will communicate to her that she doesn't have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=256.0s	256.0	 to worry about him constantly being all over her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=258.8s	258.8	 Plus it gives her time to watch him and decide that he's okay on her terms for inertia to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=264.4s	264.4	 be doing so well with such a big dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=266.4s	266.4	 Just makes me as her dad super happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=275.2s	275.2	 Inertia looks like she's really ready to play rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=277.8s	277.8	 She's like, let's go for it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=279.5s	279.5	 Chop says, okay, I'll reciprocate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=281.6s	281.6	 I'll get a little rough too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=283.2s	283.2	 And he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 But then inertia says, oh, okay, that's a little too rough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=289.5s	289.5	 This is brilliant communication between these two very smart dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=298.6s	298.6	 This so far is best case scenario.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=301.6s	301.6	 Number one, reciprocal play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=303.3s	303.3	 They're both doing play bows and neither one is being very overbearing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=307.1s	307.1	 So far they really appear to be playing politely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=309.4s	309.4	 They're testing the waters with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=311.5s	311.5	 And there are moments here where both dogs completely stop playing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=315.2s	315.2	 They sniff around and chill out for a minute in a way that isn't hyperactive at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=319.9s	319.9	 So this is a really good precedent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=324.1s	324.1	 Sometimes introducing two dogs can be a delicate process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=326.4s	326.4	 I do talk about this and many other dog training tips in my books.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=329.9s	329.9	 I'll have links below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=331.4s	331.4	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=332.9s	332.9	 Looks like his stamina is limited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=335.5s	335.5	 I do like playing chase in very short bits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=337.3s	337.3	 I can see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=338.3s	338.3	 All right, there they go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=341.3s	341.3	 Easy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=342.3s	342.3	 So I'm watching him to make sure he doesn't get too rough because inertia is pretty good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=350.4s	350.4	 at evading.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=351.4s	351.4	 However, if he catches up to her, he might put paws on her and she doesn't like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=360.0s	360.0	 But so far he seems quite polite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 They're doing so well right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=363.5s	363.5	 I'd like to see if we can get them coexisting inside paws too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=371.8s	371.8	 While inside here periodically I'm going to get Chop's attention on me maybe by snapping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=375.7s	375.7	 my fingers in order to interrupt him from being too rambunctious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=379.3s	379.3	 Especially when he attempts to put his paws on her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 I'm going to discourage that because inertia needs to have the freedom to create distance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=386.3s	386.3	 from him if she wants to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=387.9s	387.9	 And if he restrains her, that could make her more fearful and possibly escalate matters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=392.2s	392.2	 So I really need to be on top of things here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=394.0s	394.0	 I know she doesn't like the paws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=396.0s	396.0	 She's so fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=398.0s	398.0	 I know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=406.6s	406.6	 Inside things might get a little bumpy if they continue to play rambunctiously like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=409.7s	409.7	 this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=410.7s	410.7	 And I'd prefer that indoor play be a little bit more subdued than outdoor play with these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=415.5s	415.5	 two because, well, you can only imagine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=417.6s	417.6	 Okay, go ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=418.6s	418.6	 So now we'll let them resume if they want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=422.3s	422.3	 And if not, that's fine too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=424.3s	424.3	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=425.3s	425.3	 And it seems like if we just interrupt them over and over when they do things we prefer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=428.8s	428.8	 they don't do, they learn not to do them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=432.8s	432.8	 Hi, inertia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=434.8s	434.8	 You having fun?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=436.8s	436.8	 You like your new friend?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=438.0s	438.0	 I'm constantly watching these two and I'm not just going to make the assumption that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=441.9s	441.9	 oh, they're best friends and I'll let them do whatever they want now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=444.4s	444.4	 They still have a lot to learn about interacting with one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=447.1s	447.1	 Just because two dogs start off this way and play well together doesn't mean that they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=450.4s	450.4	 just bound to be best friends forever though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=452.7s	452.7	 Remember, rambunctious play can escalate at times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=455.6s	455.6	 So it's very important that I continue to intervene if things start to get a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=461.0s	461.0	 too hyperactive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=462.7s	462.7	 That way my hope is that both dogs continue to learn what's appropriate behavior over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=466.4s	466.4	 time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=467.4s	467.4	 And even though today went well, we're not out of the woods here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=470.5s	470.5	 Chop is still coming out of his shell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=471.9s	471.9	 So we still have a lot to learn about one another over the coming weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=479.9s	479.9	 You can pick them like flowers, these clumps of hair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=482.7s	482.7	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=484.6s	484.6	 Sorry, Bree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=486.0s	486.0	 I have got to brush this dog and give him a bath today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=491.2s	491.2	 I think it's a reasonable guess to say that he has probably never had a bath, at least
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=496.6s	496.6	 a formal bath in the way we're going to give him today because he's been homeless his entire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=500.8s	500.8	 life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=502.7s	502.7	 He is a very significant shedder as we have established.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=506.1s	506.1	 Usually when I brush a dog, I really try to ease them into it, make sure they're not scared
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=510.1s	510.1	 of the brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=511.1s	511.1	 Maybe they've had a past affiliation with a brush that scares them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=515.2s	515.2	 Clearly Chop does not appear, yes, to be scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=518.9s	518.9	 So I'm just right now I'm letting him smell it, reacting confidently around the brush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=523.3s	523.3	 Of course, I don't want him biting it, but I'd rather him be more playful than nervous,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=527.2s	527.2	 of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=528.6s	528.6	 I'm going to come over here right at the side of his face or under his neck and touch him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=531.8s	531.8	 with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=533.0s	533.0	 Just because that's where dogs like to be touched by humans initially when we pet them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=537.6s	537.6	 is under their chin, which can be a little counterintuitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=541.0s	541.0	 Sometimes we want to go above their head or behind them, but that can throw off a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=544.6s	544.6	 of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=545.6s	545.6	 So I'm just kind of tapping him here and a tap his shoulder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=550.2s	550.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=551.2s	551.2	 Now I'm giving him a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=552.8s	552.8	 So just really easing him into it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=555.7s	555.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=556.8s	556.8	 Go in and start brushing them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=559.1s	559.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=560.1s	560.1	 Vigorously, then that can really startle a lot of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=565.9s	565.9	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=566.9s	566.9	 He got a little nervous that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=567.9s	567.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=568.9s	568.9	 It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=569.9s	569.9	 And it goes a little easier.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=574.2s	574.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=575.5s	575.5	 So far I have like done one stroke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=578.7s	578.7	 There you go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=579.7s	579.7	 A very light one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=581.7s	581.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=583.7s	583.7	 And I'm just giving him his breakfast right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=585.8s	585.8	 I've never seen anything like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=588.7s	588.7	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=591.7s	591.7	 Sorry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=592.7s	592.7	 It's just, it's hilarious because I'm going to have to like take the hair out every three
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=598.3s	598.3	 seconds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=599.3s	599.3	 It's going to take forever to brush him going at this rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=600.7s	600.7	 Let me see if I can get a few strokes in now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=603.7s	603.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=605.1s	605.1	 I got three that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=606.5s	606.5	 He was a little thrown off, but I think he'll be okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=608.7s	608.7	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=609.7s	609.7	 Good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=610.7s	610.7	 You're doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=612.8s	612.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=613.8s	613.8	 To that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=614.8s	614.8	 For those of you with new dogs in particular, you should probably consider getting a monthly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=619.0s	619.0	 pup box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=620.1s	620.1	 They send you training supplies every month, along with a wealth of information on this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=624.5s	624.5	 extremely detailed training card that's front and back and extra durable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=629.3s	629.3	 So it's somewhat resistant to untrained dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=632.1s	632.1	 And this is all based on your dog's age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=633.8s	633.8	 So this, for example, would be the six month box.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=636.4s	636.4	 I still think it'll be helpful here, but they also have adult boxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=639.7s	639.7	 I love this box though, because they send me my favorite shampoo right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=643.0s	643.0	 I'm going to use this in a sec.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=644.6s	644.6	 One of the tips I got from the training card inside the pup box was you can use a wash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=647.9s	647.9	 cloth too, to really ease them into it if they're very sensitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=651.7s	651.7	 So that would get them used to being touched before they actually have to feel the bristles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=654.7s	654.7	 I'm going to go ahead and let him eat out of my hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=657.3s	657.3	 While I do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=659.5s	659.5	 This is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=661.8s	661.8	 This is also a great warmup for his bath because I might try to do something similar when giving

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=667.7s	667.7	 A lot of dogs lose interest in eating when you give them a bath because they're a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=671.6s	671.6	 bit stressed about what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=673.4s	673.4	 Yeah, he certainly did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=677.0s	677.0	 Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=678.0s	678.0	 Why did I say yes there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=680.4s	680.4	 He had walked away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=681.9s	681.9	 I prefer he not do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=684.0s	684.0	 I'm really careful to allow Chop to opt out here whenever he wants.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=688.2s	688.2	 I want to keep him as comfortable as possible by being patient here and going slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=692.1s	692.1	 We're dramatically increasing the odds that he will hopefully continue to feel good about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=696.6s	696.6	 this experience moving forward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=698.1s	698.1	 And you can see he comes right back too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=700.2s	700.2	 He came back automatically and I said Chop come as he was coming so I could really capture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=705.3s	705.3	 that and put it in context so he understands really what that term means because he's in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=710.8s	710.8	 the middle of performing that action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=712.8s	712.8	 And so I'm still trying to be mindful to give him treats here every several strokes just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=721.2s	721.2	 to keep it a fun experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=723.8s	723.8	 It's like you were made to live in the Arctic or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=728.4s	728.4	 And this is after brushing him for 20 minutes straight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=735.2s	735.2	 Oh gosh, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=738.2s	738.2	 Well, how's he with his tail?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=739.5s	739.5	 Good man, some dogs have sensitive tails.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=742.8s	742.8	 Chop!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=747.0s	747.0	 Yes, that was quite nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=749.8s	749.8	 Here, sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=751.8s	751.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=754.5s	754.5	 Good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=756.7s	756.7	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=759.5s	759.5	 You ready to take a bath?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=761.5s	761.5	 Okay, come on, let's go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=763.0s	763.0	 Just seeing what happened outside, I'm wondering what is the bath going to be like?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=768.8s	768.8	 This dog just lost a whole dog's worth of fur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=772.1s	772.1	 I mean, he basically just exploded before my eyes but he is still a good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=777.1s	777.1	 He's still here and he still needs a bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=782.1s	782.1	 If you approach it right, giving a dog a bath can be a fantastic way to build trust with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=786.9s	786.9	 I guess it's a great way to demonstrate that you are willing to go slowly with them through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=792.6s	792.6	 new and potentially stressful experiences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=795.2s	795.2	 The idea, especially in the beginning, is to guide them through this experience nice and easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=800.0s	800.0	 so that they'll learn even if they're a little stressed that you've got their back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=804.2s	804.2	 And once you start building trust like that, it can start to translate in other areas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=808.4s	808.4	 of your relationship with a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=810.2s	810.2	 At least that's what I found.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=814.5s	814.5	 Nice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=816.3s	816.3	 You're the heavy man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=818.1s	818.1	 Yes, good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=820.2s	820.2	 I think it's really important to go slowly when we're introducing a dog to the bath process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=826.0s	826.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=828.6s	828.6	 Doing really well here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=830.0s	830.0	 And so you can see how the water is making contact with his feet right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=834.6s	834.6	 He's aware of it but he's doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=836.6s	836.6	 So now we're going to go to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=839.0s	839.0	 I'm pointing it away from him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=840.5s	840.5	 Notice, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=841.4s	841.4	 Let me turn it off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=842.2s	842.2	 That would probably be better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=843.7s	843.7	 We'll turn it off like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=845.0s	845.0	 Hey, what's this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=846.2s	846.2	 And you can see there's a little bit still coming out there but he's doing really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=850.3s	850.3	 See?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=850.9s	850.9	 If this is indeed his first bath, I want to go out of my way to make this as good of an experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=855.9s	855.9	 as I possibly can while still making sure that he gets clean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=860.1s	860.1	 And naturally, a lot of dogs can be sensitive to getting a bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=863.4s	863.4	 It's kind of like going to the dentist for dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=866.0s	866.0	 We'll go to one of the softer sprays here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=870.6s	870.6	 That's a nice temperature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=871.8s	871.8	 Oh, you're going to like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=873.0s	873.0	 It's okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=876.0s	876.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=877.5s	877.5	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=878.1s	878.1	 Just a quick little sprinkle here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=880.2s	880.2	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=882.8s	882.8	 I think I've forgotten to take his collar off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=885.0s	885.0	 Good man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=886.2s	886.2	 Look at him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=886.9s	886.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=887.4s	887.4	 He's a little like weirded out by the water.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=891.1s	891.1	 So you're going to do short bursts, build some trust with him here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=894.9s	894.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=895.9s	895.9	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=902.0s	902.0	 I wouldn't be surprised if this was his first bath ever in life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=907.4s	907.4	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=907.9s	907.9	 He's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=909.1s	909.1	 Oh my gosh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=913.8s	913.8	 That's quite convenient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=914.8s	914.8	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=915.4s	915.4	 Gosh, he's a big dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=916.6s	916.6	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=919.4s	919.4	 He's making it easy for me here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=921.3s	921.3	 Get under him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=923.9s	923.9	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=925.4s	925.4	 I mean, he's as tall as me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=927.0s	927.0	 Look at this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=930.6s	930.6	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=931.7s	931.7	 Hey.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=932.3s	932.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=933.2s	933.2	 You want some treats?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=935.4s	935.4	 He's still taking treats too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=937.1s	937.1	 So, you know, that's a sign that he's not too stressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=940.7s	940.7	 All right, I'm going to go ahead and soak him up now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=942.6s	942.6	 He's being so brave right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=949.9s	949.9	 Oh, you already smell so much better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=952.7s	952.7	 Let's take a measure of his stress level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=954.6s	954.6	 Okay, still taking treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=956.5s	956.5	 Again, we correlate that with not too stressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=959.3s	959.3	 Dogs that are really nervous won't take treats.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=964.2s	964.2	 And you could put peanut butter on the inside of something like this to keep their attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=968.6s	968.6	 We're going to let him dry out when we're done on the deck.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=1073.0s	1073.0	 and he seems really content out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-Qc4kbLHg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=181&pp=iAQB&t=1075.0s	1075.0	 Like he could just take a nap out here for hours.
