https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=14.2s	14.2	 Leave it was your big homework.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=15.6s	15.6	 Remember, we wanted to be able to drop real meat right in front of our dogs and have them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=20.2s	20.2	 leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=21.2s	21.2	 The more hyper and the younger your dog is, the more impressive this is when they can

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=26.8s	26.8	 With Layla, we have a young and hyper dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=29.2s	29.2	 That's it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=30.2s	30.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=31.2s	31.2	 Nine months old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=32.2s	32.2	 Make sure you get there, but that was good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=36.8s	36.8	 That's good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=37.8s	37.8	 What we're working towards is being able to do a half circle to a full circle around our
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=43.2s	43.2	 dogs here initially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=44.8s	44.8	 We're introducing a brand new concept.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=46.4s	46.4	 Right now, we just set them up for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=48.3s	48.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=49.3s	49.3	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=50.3s	50.3	 Just getting them warmed up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=51.3s	51.3	 So, rather than walk away, we want to get our dogs used to seeing movement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=55.4s	55.4	 However, if they do break, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=58.0s	58.0	 We want to correct them with that verbal correction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=59.9s	59.9	 Uh-uh.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=61.9s	61.9	 Communicate to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=62.9s	62.9	 No, you shouldn't have gotten up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=64.9s	64.9	 Stay and then set them up for success on the second time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=68.2s	68.2	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=69.2s	69.2	 Make sure you're always reaching deep to be genuine and authentic with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=72.8s	72.8	 Be real with them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=76.3s	76.3	 In other words, we're not just saying a word and a hand signal at our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=79.8s	79.8	 You know what I mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 It's sit, stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=83.4s	83.4	 However you communicate that to your dog, humans are among the slowest of all animals

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=89.0s	89.0	 So, asking a four-legged animal who can run 20 miles an hour to walk at our pace is very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=95.1s	95.1	 difficult for them to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=96.6s	96.6	 Yeah, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=97.6s	97.6	 Everyone's like, you can't teach a husky to walk on a leash, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=102.1s	102.1	 But the fact is, what they're really bred to do is to communicate with people, and that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNj4M2uLqo&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=636&pp=iAQB&t=106.1s	106.1	 what this is illustrating perfectly right here.
