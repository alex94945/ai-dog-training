https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=30.5s	30.5	 He's 12 weeks old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=32.0s	32.0	 We live with my husband, my two kids, and our other dog, Miss May.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=36.0s	36.0	 Life with Louie for the first few weeks has been busy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=39.0s	39.0	 We want Louie to be a very socialized, confident dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 It can get pretty loud around here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=44.3s	44.3	 I know that dogs can be fearful of loud noises.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=46.9s	46.9	 I want to do our best to make sure he doesn't get scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=50.2s	50.2	 Zach, please show me how to teach Louie to be brave.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=53.0s	53.0	 Sure thing, Allison. With puppies like Louie, feeding them a great food is absolutely essential.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=58.7s	58.7	 You know, you're a boy. You look like a girl, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=62.4s	62.4	 Hey, I didn't make you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=63.7s	63.7	 So make sure it's always there whenever you need it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=66.3s	66.3	 Just choose your dog's food. Decide how often you want it to be delivered.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=77.8s	77.8	 Thank you to PepFlo for being an amazing sponsor of this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 I'm so much bigger than you. Look at you. You're going to try and play with me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=85.1s	85.1	 When you get a new puppy or dog, if you take the time to introduce them to many things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=88.7s	88.7	 before they have a chance to be afraid of them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=90.8s	90.8	 you might save yourself a lot of trouble by avoiding potential issues later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=96.3s	96.3	 You need to watch my puppy biting video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=98.7s	98.7	 Look, you look like a cockroach. You can't even get up. What's your problem?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=101.5s	101.5	 Now you tangled yourself up in a leash. Look at you. You're such a mess.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=105.1s	105.1	 Let's get to training Louie to be fearless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=107.4s	107.4	 You can imagine right now if I just turned on this vacuum,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=109.9s	109.9	 how much that might totally freak Louie out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=112.2s	112.2	 That's exactly what we want to avoid doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=114.7s	114.7	 This thing is weird. Think about things from your dog's perspective.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=118.0s	118.0	 It's loud. It moves around and we can't just expect our dogs to tune out the vacuum like we do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=123.3s	123.3	 Heck, if it was 10 years ago, this thing would freak me out too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=126.1s	126.1	 The first thing I want to do is have Louie get familiar with the vacuum cleaner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=129.7s	129.7	 before I even turn it on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=131.7s	131.7	 Hey Louie, what's this over here? See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=135.3s	135.3	 That interesting? I'm going to give him a little piece of turkey over here to let him know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=140.2s	140.2	 great things come out when the vacuum does, at least for now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=143.1s	143.1	 So far Louie seems really confident about the vacuum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=145.7s	145.7	 I know that when I touch this button, it's going to make a beeping sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=148.3s	148.3	 Let's see how he does with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=151.5s	151.5	 Hey, good. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=153.7s	153.7	 So he heard the beeping sound. I'm going to give him something to let him know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=156.9s	156.9	 Hey, that equals something good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=158.7s	158.7	 I mean, imagine if every time the vacuum cleaner came on when you were a kid,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 you got an extra five bucks or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=164.1s	164.1	 You start to get really excited about the vacuum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=166.4s	166.4	 You can see he's noting it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=169.4s	169.4	 Nice work. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=171.5s	171.5	 So we're going one step at a time here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=173.8s	173.8	 I think we're now at the point where we can start the vacuum for just a brief moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=181.3s	181.3	 Good. So you can hear it start to fire up there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=184.3s	184.3	 He's investigating it. He's suddenly gotten a little bit more curious about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=187.8s	187.8	 So this is a very delicate time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=189.8s	189.8	 We don't want to go too fast here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=191.6s	191.6	 I'm going to actually move him back just a little bit, just so we give him a little bit of room to take it in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=202.1s	202.1	 And now it moved. Did you see how he kind of perked up when it moved around?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=205.9s	205.9	 And so before I even really have it go on autopilot over here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=209.5s	209.5	 I should probably move it around a little bit, show him that it moves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=213.7s	213.7	 Look at him. You can tell he's intrigued.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=215.1s	215.1	 He's now being a little bit more cautious now that he saw the thing come alive and start moving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=219.4s	219.4	 I mean, you can understand how that might be a little weird.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=221.5s	221.5	 I think we're ready to maybe have it go on just a little bit longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=224.9s	224.9	 Good. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=227.7s	227.7	 Here we go. Ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=230.1s	230.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=232.7s	232.7	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=234.7s	234.7	 Right there. He was still a little distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=236.5s	236.5	 He took the treat indicating that he's still pretty comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=239.3s	239.3	 If he was really scared, he might not have taken the treat at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=245.9s	245.9	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=247.5s	247.5	 Ooh, it turned. Now it's coming towards us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=249.8s	249.8	 So just so he doesn't freak out, I'm going to stop it there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=253.1s	253.1	 He's noticing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=255.5s	255.5	 There's a nice safe distance there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=257.6s	257.6	 Hey, Louie, you're doing great, buddy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=260.0s	260.0	 There are no major signs of stress here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=262.2s	262.2	 He's noticing it, which is fine, but he's not seemingly afraid of it, which is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=267.3s	267.3	 We're trying to prevent the fear from even emerging in the first place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=271.2s	271.2	 If you don't take the time to show your dog things like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=273.7s	273.7	 then they're left to try and draw their own conclusions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=277.2s	277.2	 I think you're doing a great job, Louie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=280.5s	280.5	 And of course, I'm going to make sure it doesn't run into him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=283.2s	283.2	 You know, common sense here, folks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=285.4s	285.4	 If I can get him in a playful mood around something like this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=288.1s	288.1	 then that means we're doing a really good job,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=290.0s	290.0	 because that would indicate that his stress level is virtually non-existent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=295.2s	295.2	 It's done. You did it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=296.8s	296.8	 Now, you should do this several times over a period of a few days,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=300.1s	300.1	 just to make sure your dog is really accepting of something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=302.7s	302.7	 But so far, in our first training session,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=305.4s	305.4	 I think you couldn't ask for better results than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=307.7s	307.7	 Now, if you have the opposite problem and your dog just totally attacks the vacuum,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=314.1s	314.1	 Let's go find some more stuff that you might be scared of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=316.5s	316.5	 and teach you how to not be scared of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=318.5s	318.5	 Lots of dogs develop a fear of a trash bag when you go to refill the trash can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=322.3s	322.3	 We're so used to the noise that we don't think about it being a startling sound to our dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=326.4s	326.4	 But if left unaddressed, little things like this can become lifelong fears for many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=331.7s	331.7	 I'm just going to introduce this bag right here to Louie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=334.4s	334.4	 I'm letting... Yes. Did you see him?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=335.9s	335.9	 He kind of backed off a little bit there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=339.0s	339.0	 It's a little weird to him. See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=341.1s	341.1	 And it's possible he might already be a little bit nervous of trash bags.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=344.3s	344.3	 I don't really mind if he interacts with the bag or anything like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=348.4s	348.4	 I just want to make sure that he's not nervous of the bag.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=351.3s	351.3	 So I'm going to let him know that this makes noise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=353.8s	353.8	 It moves around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=355.3s	355.3	 So you can see here, he's smelling it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=357.3s	357.3	 He's investigating it a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=359.6s	359.6	 He's a little bit nervous of it actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=361.5s	361.5	 So I want to be really careful here and not push him too far.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=364.4s	364.4	 You're doing so well, Louie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=366.1s	366.1	 I'm very proud of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=367.5s	367.5	 Now, I'm going to try to open the garbage bag,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=369.1s	369.1	 but I'm not just going to go full blast and make that popping sound.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=372.6s	372.6	 So I'm going to do this. Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=374.2s	374.2	 You see him? Did you see him move right there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=375.8s	375.8	 His interest is peaked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 Whoa, look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=378.7s	378.7	 I mean, think how weird a garbage bag must be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=381.3s	381.3	 if you're a new puppy who's only been on this planet a few weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=384.7s	384.7	 You don't understand physics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=386.0s	386.0	 You don't know why it floats like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=388.2s	388.2	 It's up high. It's big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 And it goes from being a really small thing to being a really big thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=394.3s	394.3	 That was excellent right there. He's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=396.8s	396.8	 I was almost able to open it properly there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=401.8s	401.8	 Very good, Louie.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=405.8s	405.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=408.5s	408.5	 Oh, that last one got him a little bit, but he did really well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=411.4s	411.4	 I've got a fresh garbage bag here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=413.1s	413.1	 I'm going to see if I can open this without him getting scared.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=419.1s	419.1	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=420.0s	420.0	 He acknowledged it, but he didn't freak out too much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=422.3s	422.3	 And that is what we're going for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=424.6s	424.6	 See, just by taking these extra tiny steps when you have a new dog,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=428.5s	428.5	 you're going to avoid so many issues in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=431.2s	431.2	 Let's move on to another common household item
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=433.4s	433.4	 that makes many dogs uncomfortable at first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 But we have a dog training video to shoot here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=440.0s	440.0	 We have to teach you how to not be scared of a hairdryer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=444.7s	444.7	 Oops.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=445.5s	445.5	 My fault. I need to learn how to operate this hairdryer a bit better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=448.4s	448.4	 I'll try not to make that mistake again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=450.2s	450.2	 I really like him being in this relaxed frame of mind right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=454.8s	454.8	 He's doing great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=457.6s	457.6	 Now, if your dog is scared of loud noises like fireworks or thunderstorms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=461.1s	461.1	 basically apply the same steps that we did today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=463.9s	463.9	 But you would want to make sure that you have plenty of good treats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=466.9s	466.9	 that keep well at room temperature scattered throughout your house
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=469.8s	469.8	 and be willing to promptly burst into a spontaneous training session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=473.3s	473.3	 when fireworks start occurring or when a thunderstorm is approaching.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=477.0s	477.0	 But I'm sure I'll be making another video on that in the future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAnJDp-o-k4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=475&pp=iAQB&t=479.7s	479.7	 All of my content here on YouTube is completely free.
