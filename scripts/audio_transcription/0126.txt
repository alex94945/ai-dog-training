https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=4.2s	4.2	 If your dog isn't doing the thing you want, break it down smaller, catch them succeeding,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 Traditionally, we dog trainers think of stay in three broad categories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=15.7s	15.7	 Stay for a period of time. Stay with distance. That's when we're farther away from our dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=20.5s	20.5	 And stay while distracted, which is when they stay when something is moving or exciting them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=25.8s	25.8	 and they summon the self-discipline to hold that position.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=28.3s	28.3	 I think the problem that most of us have with stay is when our dog wants to go after something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=32.8s	32.8	 If I say, stay, and I throw that, I mean, you see how she just went after it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=38.3s	38.3	 She needs to know to hold stay when she's distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=41.1s	41.1	 That could have just as easily been a sprinting moose out of the forest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=45.1s	45.1	 or a bear while we're taking a walk, or a pronghorn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=48.4s	48.4	 Wow, look they hopped.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBkFzVwSBM4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=127&pp=iAQB&t=49.8s	49.8	 I'll show you how I continue to work on this with Veronica.
