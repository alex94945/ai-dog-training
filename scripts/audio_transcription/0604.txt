https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=4.8s	4.8	 I was so excited to see in my last video how many of you wanted to see Samson the pit bull
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 learn how to let go of a ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=11.8s	11.8	 I got the impression that many of you were dealing with a similar issue at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=15.9s	15.9	 You know, part of having a high energy dog is committing to getting them worn out mentally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 and physically and fetch is one of the ideal ways to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=24.4s	24.4	 But you don't want to spend all of your time trying to get the ball out of their mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=28.2s	28.2	 In this video, I'm going to show you how to get your dog to release the ball in as little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=33.4s	33.4	 as one training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=35.3s	35.3	 Have you guys checked out PetFlow.com yet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=37.2s	37.2	 Remember, you can get your dog food, you can get accessories, treats, toys, everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=41.2s	41.2	 in the world for your dog at one place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=43.3s	43.3	 Plus, you never have to go to the store ever, ever again to buy your dog food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=48.1s	48.1	 You can set up recurring delivery of pet food or you can order one bag at a time, whatever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=52.4s	52.4	 you want.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=53.4s	53.4	 They have over 150 brands, including prescription food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=56.9s	56.9	 When you enter promo code Zach George, you'll get $5 off any order $30 or more and you'll

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=65.7s	65.7	 By doing your shopping at PetFlow, you're supporting the dog training revolution and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=69.7s	69.7	 you're supporting positive dog training, but you're also making your life more convenient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=74.5s	74.5	 So that leaves you a lot more time to spend with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=77.6s	77.6	 Today we're going to teach Samson the pit bull how to let go of a ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=81.6s	81.6	 He's really good with fetch, but he's not good about letting it go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=85.5s	85.5	 This is a big problem that a lot of people deal with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=88.2s	88.2	 So we're going to see if we can give it a shot and see how he does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=92.5s	92.5	 There are two games that dogs are instinctively born at knowing how to play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=96.5s	96.5	 Those games are chase and tug of war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=99.2s	99.2	 Now whenever your dog tries to play chase with you or tries to play tug with you, that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=103.3s	103.3	 them trying to engage you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=105.0s	105.0	 Overall, that's a pretty good thing, but we have to polish it a little bit and show them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=109.4s	109.4	 how to play by our rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=111.2s	111.2	 What do most people do when their dog won't let go of a toy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=113.7s	113.7	 They pull even harder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=115.3s	115.3	 Remember, dogs like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=117.2s	117.2	 This isn't something we want to do when teaching them how to let go of a toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=120.8s	120.8	 Now tug of war can be great, but that's a completely different topic altogether.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=124.3s	124.3	 You know what the biggest secret in the world of teaching a dog to let go of a ball is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=127.7s	127.7	 A, make sure you have them on a leash so you can get to them because you don't want them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=130.8s	130.8	 running away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=131.8s	131.8	 The whole idea is to suddenly make the game dramatically less interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 Get them close to you, hold the ball, do not pull, wait, make life boring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=140.6s	140.6	 Your goal is to just stabilize the toy for a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=143.0s	143.0	 For a dog like Samson, this is a lot less exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=146.0s	146.0	 Be prepared to wait this out for up to a minute or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=148.9s	148.9	 Now when he lets go, what do you think I'm going to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=151.0s	151.0	 I'm going to let him know that I love the behavior and I'm going to immediately give
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=154.1s	154.1	 him the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=155.1s	155.1	 Not a treat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=156.1s	156.1	 A dog like this wants to play, not eat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=159.0s	159.0	 Whenever you have a high drive dog like this, you should almost never reward with food when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=163.3s	163.3	 teaching the various aspects of fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=166.2s	166.2	 You want them focused on the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=167.8s	167.8	 Come on buddy, Samson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=169.8s	169.8	 Good boy, here we go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=170.8s	170.8	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=171.8s	171.8	 Good about bringing it back, but see he doesn't like to let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=175.3s	175.3	 I'm going to hold this just as a safety net.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=177.4s	177.4	 I'm going to wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=179.1s	179.1	 Uh-uh-uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=180.1s	180.1	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=181.1s	181.1	 He let go for just a minor second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=183.2s	183.2	 I'm going to immediately give it back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=184.6s	184.6	 That's the biggest mistake people make is that they don't reward fast enough when their
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=189.1s	189.1	 dog lets go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=190.1s	190.1	 By not rewarding frequently and quickly enough in the beginning, you're validating your dog's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=194.6s	194.6	 suspicion that if you take the ball from them, they may never see it again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 Make sure you get that ball to them as soon as you possibly can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=202.5s	202.5	 Samson, come here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=205.0s	205.0	 See right there, he didn't come right back to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=206.4s	206.4	 I'm in a position to get him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 After your dog has shown that they're starting to get the point, then you can start to slow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=211.4s	211.4	 down a little bit and make them think a little bit more so that way you can start to do something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=215.9s	215.9	 that resembles more of a structured game of fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=219.1s	219.1	 What I'm not doing is, uh-uh-uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=221.2s	221.2	 Leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 I'm not going to put it behind my back here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=223.4s	223.4	 It's right in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=225.0s	225.0	 Good boy, go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=226.4s	226.4	 Teach your dog to think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=227.7s	227.7	 You don't need to use diversionary tactics like putting the toy behind your back or distracting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=232.1s	232.1	 them with treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=233.5s	233.5	 They're plenty smart enough to get this without gimmicks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=236.2s	236.2	 This is not a hard thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=237.9s	237.9	 Wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=238.9s	238.9	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=239.9s	239.9	 I'm going to create a barrier with my other hand here, just like leave it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=245.2s	245.2	 That's all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=246.2s	246.2	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=247.2s	247.2	 Yes, get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=249.0s	249.0	 So I made him wait a little bit longer that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=250.9s	250.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=251.9s	251.9	 May I have it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=252.9s	252.9	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=253.9s	253.9	 Every time I say no, there's a consequence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=255.8s	255.8	 In this case, the game stops and I'm just gripping him by the collar just to keep control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=259.3s	259.3	 of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=260.3s	260.3	 He's still wagging his tail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=262.3s	262.3	 Now if your dog was more sensitive, you wouldn't do this, but chances are if you have a sensitive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=265.4s	265.4	 dog they likely don't have this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=267.9s	267.9	 Again, if he wants to go on his back, fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=271.6s	271.6	 I'm not playing tug, but I'm holding the ball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=275.4s	275.4	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=279.6s	279.6	 Go get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=280.6s	280.6	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epiNkbdrsiQ&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=605&pp=iAQB&t=282.2s	282.2	 That's wonderful.
