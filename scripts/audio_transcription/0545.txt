https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=6.4s	6.4	 Today I'm going to take some of your questions that you guys asked me on Facebook.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=9.8s	9.8	 I tried to select some really good ones that may apply to a lot of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 Give the video a big thumbs up if you're enjoying the Q&A format.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=19.4s	19.4	 And remember, if you're new to my videos, I'll have a link to a playlist in the description
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=23.9s	23.9	 that will show you how to teach your dog the basics in order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=26.9s	26.9	 That of course is completely free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 Now if you do require an answer from me, you can consider making a contribution to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=33.7s	33.7	 our Patreon campaign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=35.2s	35.2	 I'll have the details in the description.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=37.0s	37.0	 I've told you about PetFlow.com and how they offer automatic pet food delivery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=41.0s	41.0	 Basically you just pick your food and how often you want it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=44.6s	44.6	 What I didn't realize is that PetFlow also offers automatic delivery of your flea and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=49.8s	49.8	 heartworm prevention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 Now living here on the Gulf Coast in the United States, it's extremely important that the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=56.2s	56.2	 dogs have their heartworm prevention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 Since these are prescriptions, I thought it might be more problematic and more kind of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=61.0s	61.0	 a pain to set up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=62.0s	62.0	 But actually, they probably have your vet in a database.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=65.1s	65.1	 You just type in your vet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=66.2s	66.2	 It comes up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=67.2s	67.2	 They ask you, is this your vet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=68.5s	68.5	 You say yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=69.5s	69.5	 They take care of the rest and your flea and heartworm preventative is always there when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=73.6s	73.6	 you need it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=74.9s	74.9	 And you can change that schedule or edit it at any time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=77.7s	77.7	 Ensuring that those preventatives are always there when I need them is fantastic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=83.1s	83.1	 And for those of you that do opt to set up automatic pet food delivery, just enter code
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=87.4s	87.4	 ZACH20 when you check out and you'll get 20% off of your first order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=91.2s	91.2	 I'll have a link in the description that will show you exactly where you need to go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=95.0s	95.0	 OK, we're going to take our first question here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=97.0s	97.0	 This comes from Gloria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=98.0s	98.0	 Hi Zach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 I would like to know what your suggestion is about how often you should do training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=102.7s	102.7	 sessions and how long each training session should be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=106.8s	106.8	 Thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=107.8s	107.8	 OK, great question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=109.5s	109.5	 Common question, but I'm going to answer it probably a little bit differently than other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=112.9s	112.9	 people might answer this question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=115.4s	115.4	 First, it's important to understand that there are two types of training sessions largely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 of primary training sessions and secondary training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=123.8s	123.8	 Primary training sessions are what you might think where you sit down and work with your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=126.9s	126.9	 dog and ask them to sit, stay, lie down, leave it, look at me and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 That's where you're really giving your dog your undivided attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=134.3s	134.3	 You've set aside some time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=136.4s	136.4	 Secondary training sessions are where you have to snap into training mode on a moment's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=142.0s	142.0	 is jumping on the coffee table or jumping on guests or biting the couch cushion or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=147.6s	147.6	 And that requires you to either get a hold of your dog and put them in an environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=152.0s	152.0	 where they can't perform the behavior or go into a secondary training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=156.5s	156.5	 This is what you'll have to make up your mind on a case by case basis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=159.9s	159.9	 Obviously you have to pick your battles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=162.1s	162.1	 This will vary from dog to dog, but on primary training sessions, about five to 20 minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=166.9s	166.9	 per training session, three to five times a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=169.6s	169.6	 I mean, but again, this is a wide spectrum of dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=173.0s	173.0	 If you get a really high drive dog who can just train and train all day, then you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=177.4s	177.4	 get by with a longer period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 Then you've got other dogs who are just like, I don't care so much about training right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=183.4s	183.4	 now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=184.4s	184.4	 You know, I'll give you five minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=185.9s	185.9	 And so you kind of have to work with them on that and gradually increase the period
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 of time that they're receptive over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=191.1s	191.1	 The best way to do that is to make training enjoyable and interesting to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=194.8s	194.8	 And you'll have to brainstorm with each dog as to what they like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 And keeping your treats very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=200.5s	200.5	 Something like real meat, real chicken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=202.1s	202.1	 That's typically what I use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=203.6s	203.6	 Or even better, if your dog is receptive to play tug of war and fetch are fantastic ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=208.4s	208.4	 to get some extra mileage out of your training sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=210.9s	210.9	 As far as secondary training sessions go, well, that depends more on you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=214.6s	214.6	 And if you're willing to give your dog the attention they need during those various moments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=218.6s	218.6	 So if you have company over and your dog is play biting on you and biting your hands and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=223.5s	223.5	 or your company's hands, that means you need to get into training mode, either work with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=227.6s	227.6	 them on a sit, stay and give them their rewards as they earn them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=231.4s	231.4	 Or again, just simply put them in an environment where that type of behavior can't take place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=235.9s	235.9	 until you're ready to give them your undivided attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=239.1s	239.1	 Dogs don't respond well to an unfocused trainer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=241.1s	241.1	 So always make sure that you are committed and fully focused on your dog, whether it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=245.6s	245.6	 be a primary training session or a secondary training session.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=248.7s	248.7	 I hope this answers your question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=250.5s	250.5	 I get this next question all of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=252.7s	252.7	 Anita says, I have a nine week old female English Springer Spaniel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=256.5s	256.5	 How do I train her to tell me when she needs to go outside to go potty?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=260.1s	260.1	 I've watched lots of videos, but I haven't seen anything on how to teach this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=263.6s	263.6	 The short answer is you don't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=265.8s	265.8	 Not at this age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=266.8s	266.8	 Your dog has so much on his or her plate right now as far as taking in the world, learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=272.2s	272.2	 how to do the basics and really trying to learn what's expected of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=276.6s	276.6	 You're in the communication building phase right now, which means your communication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=280.0s	280.0	 is very, very limited because you've only had your dog for just, you know, I would assume
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=284.1s	284.1	 about a week at the most right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=286.2s	286.2	 So your focus needs to be on building communication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=289.0s	289.0	 What you'll find is that your dog will probably automatically start soliciting you to be let
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=293.6s	293.6	 outside as he or she gets older.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=295.8s	295.8	 In fact, they'll probably constantly want to be let out if they're anything like my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=299.2s	299.2	 dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=300.2s	300.2	 So what I do is I just let my dogs out every, you know, every three, four hours or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=303.4s	303.4	 The bottom line is that it's not your dog's responsibility to let you know when they have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=307.8s	307.8	 to go outside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=308.8s	308.8	 It's on you to let your dog out hourly for the next several months to get up in the middle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=313.7s	313.7	 of the night if you have to, to let them out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=316.1s	316.1	 So while they may whimper sometimes to indicate that they probably have to go potty, then

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=325.0s	325.0	 You want to be proactive in the matter and really get them out there as much as you can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=328.9s	328.9	 With potty training, the goal is to get your dog to prefer a certain type of surface or

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 It's common for it to take up to a year to fully potty train a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=350.6s	350.6	 Now that's not to say that you can't get mostly there in the first several months, but it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=381.7s	381.7	 Usually this is either the result of a dog's natural personality or lack of socialization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=386.8s	386.8	 at a young age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=388.1s	388.1	 I don't think you told me how old your dog is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=390.0s	390.0	 If your dog is really young exhibiting these behaviors, pretty normal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=393.9s	393.9	 And the answer I'm going to give you here would apply to whether your dog is young and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=396.8s	396.8	 unsocialized or older and maybe still unsocialized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=402.2s	402.2	 But either way, this is how I would approach it based on what you've told me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=406.0s	406.0	 So we don't want to wait until it's time to go to the vet, the groomer or the pet supply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=410.3s	410.3	 store in order to get our dog comfortable with being around these situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=415.9s	415.9	 In other words, you want to really take a lot of measures and this takes work, but you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=420.3s	420.3	 can get there if your desire is strong enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=422.8s	422.8	 The goal is to take your dog around these situations as often as possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=426.9s	426.9	 In fact, I'd like to see you go two to three times a week to your local pet supply store
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=432.1s	432.1	 or to the vet or to the groomer just to hang around and just desensitize her to what's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=436.8s	436.8	 going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=437.8s	437.8	 Of course, bring your treats if she likes to play, maybe try and encourage her to play,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=441.2s	441.2	 though I understand that may be a bit tougher with a dog who's kind of timid in these situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=446.2s	446.2	 So really good treats are probably your best bet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=448.6s	448.6	 If possible, hang out there for about an hour, just running through your drills, sit, stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=453.4s	453.4	 down, giving her her treats, whatever she knows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=456.1s	456.1	 And the idea is to create some normalcy in these situations that they typically find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=460.1s	460.1	 stressful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=461.5s	461.5	 The more time a dog spends around situations that usually stress them out, the less likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=467.1s	467.1	 they are to react unfavorably or stressed in those settings.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=472.1s	472.1	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=473.3s	473.3	 So that's that's the game plan I would recommend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=476.2s	476.2	 Now this could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to a few years, depending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=481.1s	481.1	 on the severity of your dog's issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=484.0s	484.0	 Obviously, keep other dogs away from your dog during the beginning parts of this in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=488.6s	488.6	 order to prevent any any type of fear aggression response from your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=493.6s	493.6	 The idea right now is just to create some comfort in these situations and get her listening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=499.3s	499.3	 to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=500.3s	500.3	 Now, at first, I don't expect your dog to listen to you while in this type of environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=503.9s	503.9	 So give it several minutes, maybe even up to 20 or 30 minutes before you expect her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=507.8s	507.8	 to really listen to you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=514.9s	514.9	 So be understanding of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=516.8s	516.8	 Another great thing that you can do that will help tremendously is to exercise your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=520.6s	520.6	 before being in these situations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=528.1s	528.1	 appropriate for your individual dog.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=666.4s	666.4	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=668.2s	668.2	 Most dogs will outgrow this by the age of one year or so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=672.8s	672.8	 Until then, what we want to do is make sure that we get our dogs pee out of them before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=677.3s	677.3	 they are likely to become excited.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=679.4s	679.4	 For example, if you know that you have people coming over, get them outside, get them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=684.5s	684.5	 get all their pee out of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=685.9s	685.9	 Also a little bit of exercise and play might temper their reaction a bit when people do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=690.2s	690.2	 come over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=691.2s	691.2	 And while they're still likely to be excited, they may be just less excited enough to not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=697.3s	697.3	 pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=698.3s	698.3	 You're looking for improvement on this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=699.4s	699.4	 There is no magic answer to this issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=701.6s	701.6	 You're still going to have to be tolerant of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=703.4s	703.4	 If possible, maybe have the dog greet people outside when they come over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=707.4s	707.4	 Now, if it's you that's greeting the dog and getting them excited, say you've come home
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=712.4s	712.4	 after five or six hours and they become excited and usually tend to pee, well, obviously minimize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=718.8s	718.8	 your energy level, act pretty boring, immediately get them outside to pee and do that very consistently
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=724.4s	724.4	 for up to a year, I'd say, to make sure that they get the habit established.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=729.1s	729.1	 A related issue is something called submissive urination, which is instead of peeing when
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=733.1s	733.1	 they get excited, they tend to get really nervous and pee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=736.4s	736.4	 And you would go about this in the same exact way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=739.1s	739.1	 Both of these are often symptoms of lack of socialization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=744.7s	744.7	 So it's really common with young dogs who are still in the socialization phase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=749.4s	749.4	 Also their bladders become stronger with age as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=752.6s	752.6	 Great question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=753.8s	753.8	 And let's move on to our next one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=755.0s	755.0	 This question is from Woody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=757.0s	757.0	 My seven month old Brittany spaniel walks okay on leash in our yard other than biting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=762.2s	762.2	 the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=763.2s	763.2	 But as soon as we get on the other side of the gate, he starts pulling and is only interested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=767.4s	767.4	 in sniffing the ground.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=768.6s	768.6	 He does look at me well in the yard, but seldom does it outside of the yard for treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=774.4s	774.4	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=775.4s	775.4	 Great question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=776.4s	776.4	 I know exactly what's going on here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=778.1s	778.1	 At least I think I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=779.1s	779.1	 I don't want to be too presumptuous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=781.3s	781.3	 It sounds like you have not appropriately phased in the bridge between the two environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=786.0s	786.0	 There's this thing in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=787.5s	787.5	 It's the craziest thing that progress doesn't just happen within its own containers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=793.6s	793.6	 You kind of have to merge those containers together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=796.4s	796.4	 So it's extremely common for dogs to be very obedient, to listen to everything you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=800.9s	800.9	 to say inside the house.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=802.9s	802.9	 And then following after that, it's common for them to listen to everything you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=805.8s	805.8	 to say while in your yard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=808.3s	808.3	 Still a very familiar area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=809.7s	809.7	 But the moment you get out of your property lines, they're like, who are you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=813.1s	813.1	 I'm just going, this is too exciting for me to listen to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=816.0s	816.0	 So a common mistake that a lot of us make when we're teaching our dogs to walk on leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=821.1s	821.1	 relatively desirably is that we attempt to do our main training and our scheduled walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=828.5s	828.5	 at the same time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=829.8s	829.8	 At first, you really can't get by with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=831.5s	831.5	 You want to have two types of walks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=833.2s	833.2	 You want to have walks where you're strictly focused on training and getting their attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=837.8s	837.8	 on you from time to time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=839.0s	839.0	 That sounds like where you are right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=840.3s	840.3	 You're trying to get your dog's eyes on you outside of the confines of your property and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=845.4s	845.4	 that's not going well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=846.6s	846.6	 So what you need to do is take a step back, focus on getting your dog's eyes on you while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=851.8s	851.8	 in that really gray area where your dog becomes somewhat receptive to not really receptive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=858.2s	858.2	 The best way to practice this, I find, is to go in front of your house and walk back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=862.5s	862.5	 and forth just on your own property line, working on look at me, working on sit and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=867.2s	867.2	 lie down, all of that in a relatively distraction free environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=870.8s	870.8	 I say relatively because remember, any time you change any element of the environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=874.9s	874.9	 you're likely to somewhat distract your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=877.3s	877.3	 And the goal is to see that line get bigger and bigger over the next several training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=880.7s	880.7	 sessions where you can get them obedient there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=884.1s	884.1	 Now what about when you have to just take your dog on a walk because you want to go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=887.1s	887.1	 on a walk?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=888.1s	888.1	 In the meantime, be tolerant of the ground sniffing, be tolerant of the pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=892.5s	892.5	 Dogs are still very social, very curious animals and we need to let them satisfy that to some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=897.2s	897.2	 degree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=898.2s	898.2	 We don't want to just make walks a big pain in the butt and have them constantly looking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=902.6s	902.6	 at us or healing in this competition like heel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=906.7s	906.7	 Let dogs be dogs, but at the same time phase in more appropriate leash walking over a few
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=911.9s	911.9	 months I would say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=914.0s	914.0	 Exercise prior to both of these types of training is highly recommended, especially if you have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt-6DBZwag&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=546&pp=iAQB&t=919.7s	919.7	 a higher energy dog.
