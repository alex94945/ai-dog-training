https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=318.9s	318.9	 For your dog, fetch is like learning a new game and they get more and more interested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=323.8s	323.8	 over time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=328.6s	328.6	 to show them how fun this game really is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=332.1s	332.1	 Today I'm going to start at the very beginning of how to teach your dog a really nice game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=336.2s	336.2	 of fetch so that you can begin to resolve almost all of the unwanted behaviors you're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=340.7s	340.7	 currently dealing with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=341.8s	341.8	 The two raw ingredients to teaching your dog how to play a good game of fetch are chase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=346.3s	346.3	 and tug of war.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=347.3s	347.3	 I'd say we've got tug of war pretty solid here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=349.9s	349.9	 Do not use treats when teaching fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=353.6s	353.6	 Dogs use their mouths for two main things, eating and grabbing stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=357.7s	357.7	 Therefore from a training perspective, they are either in food mode or play mode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=362.9s	362.9	 The two are not simultaneously compatible for most dogs though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=366.3s	366.3	 The reward is continued play with the toy, not food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=370.5s	370.5	 We're trying to bring the energy to the surface so that we can direct it in a manageable way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=375.5s	375.5	 Even a lot of dog trainers make that mistake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=377.3s	377.3	 Now you could use treats to teach your dog to go and retrieve something, but that's different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=381.6s	381.6	 from a proper fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 The way to start teaching your dog fetch is not to throw the item.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=387.1s	387.1	 It's to get them interested in the toy first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=389.3s	389.3	 You actually teach fetch in reverse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=391.8s	391.8	 So here we're going to just get them really interested in it, just like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=396.2s	396.2	 And I'm okay with him tugging right now, but we have to teach him how to let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=400.0s	400.0	 In a nutshell, teaching fetch to your dog starts with teaching a good tug of war and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=404.3s	404.3	 a good let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=405.8s	405.8	 Most of you at home can actually expect results on this in the first training session, maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=409.6s	409.6	 two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=410.6s	410.6	 So how do you get your dog to let go of a toy?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=412.1s	412.1	 By using some very basic reverse psychology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=414.7s	414.7	 I'm going to make life uninteresting right now by stopping pulling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=418.1s	418.1	 See dogs like it when we pull back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=419.8s	419.8	 That's very gratifying to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=421.1s	421.1	 We're just going to hold it right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=422.4s	422.4	 We're going to wait.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=424.0s	424.0	 And when he lets go, I'm going to immediately give him the rope toy right back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=428.0s	428.0	 Because remember, the toy is the reward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=430.7s	430.7	 Let your dog know just because you let go doesn't mean I'm going to keep it forever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=434.1s	434.1	 All our dogs really want to know is, hey, can I have it back?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=436.9s	436.9	 Show them there is a very clear path to play tug of war all day long if they play by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=441.2s	441.2	 rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=442.2s	442.2	 Just make the game uninteresting for a minute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=443.8s	443.8	 If you have to sit here for five minutes, so what your attitude is, look, I got all day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=447.1s	447.1	 long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=448.1s	448.1	 If your dog gets a little rambunctious during this part, be patient and maintain a cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=451.9s	451.9	 head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=452.9s	452.9	 If you have a really amped up dog, a long walk before fetch training might be just enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=457.8s	457.8	 to make them manageable for teaching them to let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=460.7s	460.7	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=462.7s	462.7	 Tiny microsecond that he let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=464.7s	464.7	 Even though he went to bite it again, I want to let him know that that little bit of progress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=468.8s	468.8	 right there is very appreciated by me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=471.7s	471.7	 Avoid when they let go, pulling it away, putting it behind your back, asking them to sit and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=475.8s	475.8	 adding all this other criteria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=478.0s	478.0	 You want to make sure that you really just focus on, hey, I like that you did that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=481.5s	481.5	 Let's start there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=482.5s	482.5	 I'm really satisfied that he's starting to get the concept, so I'm going to ask him to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=485.8s	485.8	 leave it alone for an extra second or two this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=489.6s	489.6	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=490.6s	490.6	 Leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=492.6s	492.6	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=493.6s	493.6	 And again, I just created a bit of a barrier there just so he could think and resist that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=498.5s	498.5	 impulse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=499.5s	499.5	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=502.1s	502.1	 Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=503.1s	503.1	 I'm going to attempt to stand up and keep the toy right in front of him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=505.8s	505.8	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=506.8s	506.8	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=507.8s	507.8	 That's what I'm talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=509.4s	509.4	 So once your dog has tugged and released kind of down, it's time to go on to the next step.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=514.5s	514.5	 And that would be throwing the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=516.3s	516.3	 But keep those first several throws short.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=519.5s	519.5	 It's better to get lots of reps at first so that your dog becomes familiar with the structure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=523.7s	523.7	 and the process of the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=525.6s	525.6	 If you're right there to encourage your dog to chase you back to the point of origin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=529.9s	529.9	 this will discourage your dog from playing keep away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=532.7s	532.7	 Dogs love to chase, but they don't really care who's chasing who.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=536.7s	536.7	 Make them chase you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=538.2s	538.2	 Now shorten the distance between you and your dog, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=540.7s	540.7	 And then when Lafitte does it, we're going to go back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=543.1s	543.1	 See, the closer we are to our dogs, the more likely they are to chase us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=546.6s	546.6	 So we don't want to just stay put.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=548.2s	548.2	 We want to make it a real interactive game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=550.1s	550.1	 So if you shorten the distance after the throw is there on their way to it, you're right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=554.3s	554.3	 there to kind of lure them back with your eyes and encourage them to chase you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=558.4s	558.4	 Does that make sense?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=559.4s	559.4	 Fun is the number one priority when teaching fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=561.8s	561.8	 All right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=562.8s	562.8	 So what do you do if your dog just loses interest in the toy while you're trying to play?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=566.0s	566.0	 This happens a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=567.2s	567.2	 When a toy stops moving, dogs get less interested.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=570.2s	570.2	 Watch this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=571.2s	571.2	 Lafitte, Lafitte, let's just look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=574.2s	574.2	 Look at that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=576.2s	576.2	 Let's see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=577.2s	577.2	 I'm bringing it back to life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=579.0s	579.0	 But just a little bit there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=580.3s	580.3	 Good, good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=582.3s	582.3	 So if you can bring a little bit of life to the toy like that, it'll reignite their interest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=586.6s	586.6	 in it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=591.2s	591.2	 This requires immediate and prompt action on your part.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=594.0s	594.0	 We have to go bring the toy to life and then run.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=596.1s	596.1	 There we go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=599.7s	599.7	 And so the priority there is getting them to bring it back, not let go immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=603.6s	603.6	 It's normal for dogs to be really interested in one toy at first or maybe a couple.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=608.8s	608.8	 But as time goes on, you'll probably see that they'll start to generalize the game with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=612.0s	612.0	 all sorts of toys, sticks, you name it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=614.4s	614.4	 And rather than take the stick away, make the other toy more exciting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=617.9s	617.9	 See that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=618.9s	618.9	 And just move it around a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=619.9s	619.9	 Avoid picking it up completely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=621.1s	621.1	 Just move it around.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=625.7s	625.7	 That's what I'm talking about.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=631.7s	631.7	 handle it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=632.7s	632.7	 The ideal way to get your dog to bring something back to you is to run from them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=636.1s	636.1	 But not everybody can do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=637.8s	637.8	 So if you can't do that, the next best thing to do is to have your dog on a really long

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=644.5s	644.5	 That'll take a little bit longer, but you'll still get there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=646.7s	646.7	 If you notice that your dog is all about fetch inside, but then you come in the backyard

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=652.3s	652.3	 I just want to smell around.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=662.6s	662.6	 Now, it can take a few minutes for them to acclimate because you've got to get in time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=665.8s	665.8	 to sniff around or it can take a much longer period of time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=675.4s	675.4	 that's also very normal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=683.2s	683.2	 get more interesting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uUQE32FuU&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=564&pp=iAQB&t=688.2s	688.2	 Dogs are really drawn to a super happy, exciting person.
