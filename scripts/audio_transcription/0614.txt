https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=29.7s	29.7	 Or are you happy with the way your dog behaves the way they are now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=32.9s	32.9	 Tell me in the comments below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=34.2s	34.2	 You guys remember Bo, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=35.5s	35.5	 Bo was an American Bulldog that I worked with to try and overcome his nervousness of strangers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=39.9s	39.9	 Well, a lot of you asked for a follow-up, so I decided to do one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=43.7s	43.7	 He's much more accepting of me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=45.0s	45.0	 He's very comfortable in his home environment as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=47.4s	47.4	 But he is dealing with a destructive behavior that many of your dogs are dealing with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 That is destructive chewing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=53.3s	53.3	 Now, the advice I'm going to offer you in this video will help not only with that, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=57.6s	57.6	 also with other types of unwanted behaviors like unwanted jumping or digging up the yard,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=63.1s	63.1	 even excessive barking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=64.6s	64.6	 Most dogs that are destructive towards property are usually dogs that have a lot of energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=69.0s	69.0	 He has three remote controls.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=71.1s	71.1	 Recently?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=72.1s	72.1	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=73.1s	73.1	 When Tracy told me that Bo was destroying the remote controls in the house, I knew immediately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=76.5s	76.5	 this was a lack of structured exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=79.9s	79.9	 We try to let them out and let them play, but all they want to do is just stand at the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=83.5s	83.5	 You know, many dog trainers make the mistake of catering to the ancestral wolf qualities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=87.8s	87.8	 of our dog rather than catering to the human influence of the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=92.4s	92.4	 All domestic dogs were bred to work with human beings to one degree or another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=97.1s	97.1	 Therefore, if we cater to that part of the dog, we'll get much faster results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=101.3s	101.3	 This breed is a physical breed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=103.4s	103.4	 I mean, they've been created by mankind to be very strong, to have tons of stamina and endurance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=108.1s	108.1	 Exercise resolves over 90% of behavior issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=110.8s	110.8	 We don't have the time in the morning to do anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=113.7s	113.7	 We let them out in the morning and we try to let them out and let them play.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=117.7s	117.7	 A lot of people think that if they have multiple dogs, that their dogs playing together counts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=121.5s	121.5	 as exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=123.1s	123.1	 For most dogs, that's usually not sufficient enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=125.7s	125.7	 Chasing each other doesn't provide enough mental stimulation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=128.6s	128.6	 They need direct interaction with people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 I would be willing to bet that 10 to 15 minutes before work would almost resolve all chewing issues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=135.9s	135.9	 Usually a dog that has issues relating to hyperactivity is almost always receptive to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=140.7s	140.7	 learning a good game of fetch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=142.3s	142.3	 But very few dogs do fetch perfectly without some specific training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=146.9s	146.9	 For example, in Bo's case, he likes to go for the toy before you can pick it up or try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=150.8s	150.8	 and take it out of your hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=152.4s	152.4	 You can see there, I'm not moving the toy away from Bo any more than I have to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=156.1s	156.1	 I already know that he knows leave it because he learned that in class, at least with food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=160.7s	160.7	 So I'm trying to tap into that part of his brain and apply it to the toy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=164.3s	164.3	 You know, dogs shows that they're trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=165.7s	165.7	 We need to let them know it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=167.3s	167.3	 Since Bo wants that toy more than anything, I'm going to give it to him once I feel he's earned it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=172.6s	172.6	 Our dogs don't know the rules yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=173.9s	173.9	 We have to teach them how the game is played.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=177.1s	177.1	 So I'm going to try it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 Alright, that's what you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=179.1s	179.1	 When he goes for it like that, you and me do...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=181.3s	181.3	 It's really important to use a lot of engaging body language when you're training your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=189.3s	189.3	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=190.3s	190.3	 Dramatically remove yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=191.9s	191.9	 I mean, I bolted for him to let him know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=193.8s	193.8	 That made me get way far away and made the game come nowhere close to happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=197.9s	197.9	 This is how we handle it when he picks it up premature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=203.7s	203.7	 Ah, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=205.7s	205.7	 You see that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=206.7s	206.7	 Look at that look right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=207.7s	207.7	 Train in slow motion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=209.7s	209.7	 Don't try and be fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=211.0s	211.0	 Let your dog think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=212.0s	212.0	 Let them process what's going on here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=216.7s	216.7	 He's smart enough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=217.7s	217.7	 Don't feel like you've got to outsmart him with this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=219.6s	219.6	 No, leave it alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=223.6s	223.6	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=224.6s	224.6	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=225.6s	225.6	 I mean, he worked for that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=226.6s	226.6	 He was really good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=227.6s	227.6	 Teaching a really structured version of tug of war with your dog can be very beneficial as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=232.6s	232.6	 Okay, good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=235.6s	235.6	 Yes, good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=237.6s	237.6	 So I think with my dogs, I like to teach them get it and let go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=240.6s	240.6	 Let go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=253.6s	253.6	 My job is to teach people like you how to teach your dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=256.6s	256.6	 Let's see if Tracy can get the same results with Bo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=259.6s	259.6	 Because he doesn't touch that unless you say get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=264.6s	264.6	 A lot of this is because he's already had exercise, so he's much more compliant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=267.6s	267.6	 If you can burn off that initial layer with a high energy dog like this, then they become
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9-q1_J3hs&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=615&pp=iAQB&t=272.6s	272.6	 the most obedient, best dogs on earth.
