https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 I'm just going to go over a quick, very, very informal dog training thing here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=7.2s	7.2	 I can't even call it a tutorial or a lesson really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=10.1s	10.1	 But this was actually going to go on my video blog channel because I do stuff like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=12.9s	12.9	 over there too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=13.9s	13.9	 But I figured I would just throw this up over here too about teaching your dog how to listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=20.4s	20.4	 to you when you have multiple dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 I will say this though before I get into that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=25.4s	25.4	 When you are working with multiple dogs, it is ideal to work not with multiple dogs, to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=31.4s	31.4	 work with them one at a time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=33.0s	33.0	 Do you know what I'm saying?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=35.0s	35.0	 Now given the nature of how I teach dogs at a park setting like this very often because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=40.5s	40.5	 I like to teach them frisbee really early in life and it's kind of a pain to not bring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=46.2s	46.2	 all of my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 It's better to bring all of my dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 So I'm kind of forced to work with them all at one time which means that the rules have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=53.5s	53.5	 to be very strict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=54.6s	54.6	 In other words, if I'm working with Venus, Alpha has to stay and I have to enforce that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=59.8s	59.8	 So again, this is really, I just kind of want to delve into consistency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=65.2s	65.2	 That's the bigger picture of what I'm trying to teach you here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=68.1s	68.1	 And this applies in so many areas of dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=71.3s	71.3	 So let me know what you think.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 Leave your comment below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=83.1s	83.1	 take turns playing frisbee?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=95.5s	95.5	 for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=96.5s	96.5	 I mean, quite honestly, it's just a matter of, okay, Alpha, are you ready?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=101.8s	101.8	 Okay, I'm going to throw your frisbee.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=104.8s	104.8	 Hold on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=110.8s	110.8	 Probably should have moved that chair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 Now, Venus, Venus, this is for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=119.4s	119.4	 Are you ready?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=123.9s	123.9	 him off of it because he's going to listen to me because I've trained come when called.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=127.0s	127.0	 I've trained stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=131.6s	131.6	 off distractions, including cats and squirrels and everything else, because that's one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=135.6s	135.6	 the first things I teach any dog I work with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=139.6s	139.6	 But even if he did go for it, I would run right after him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=142.4s	142.4	 I would chase him and I would interrupt it and put him into a down stay and a 30 second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=146.8s	146.8	 time out for not listening to stay even while he's distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=150.8s	150.8	 Venus, go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=155.1s	155.1	 Alpha, come here, handsome.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=180.9s	180.9	 you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 You get the results that you want to get.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 I talk about it all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 Let go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=207.4s	207.4	 Venus, go.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=220.4s	220.4	 It's just, you know, consistency.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 Excellent job.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=241.1s	241.1	 Go on, buddy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D_16qpO21Y&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=657&pp=iAQB&t=259.4s	259.4	 Excellent job.
