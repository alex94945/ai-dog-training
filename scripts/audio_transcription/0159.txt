https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 Biscuits has been making lightning quick progress since she's been with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=3.4s	3.4	 And today we'll continue putting together the pieces to see what emerges.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=7.5s	7.5	 I just need to make sure she can come and stay and hopefully get the beginnings of heel in the real world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=12.8s	12.8	 It almost feels like there's not an issue here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=15.4s	15.4	 Okay, we have an issue here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=17.8s	17.8	 I spoke too soon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=19.1s	19.1	 My dog just licked elk poop, period.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=22.2s	22.2	 Should I be concerned? Question mark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=24.9s	24.9	 Did you take a video of it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=26.2s	26.2	 That's a big poop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=27.3s	27.3	 I think there are large elk in the area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=29.4s	29.4	 Of course I took a video. I take a video of everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=31.8s	31.8	 I'll kiss you. You don't kiss me for at least three days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=35.5s	35.5	 Have any of you tried calling a vet lately?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=37.4s	37.4	 Have you noticed how backed up they are?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=39.1s	39.1	 Fuzzy is a telehealth app that gives you 24-7 access to veterinary professionals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=44.7s	44.7	 Yeah, so she's answered here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=46.0s	46.0	 A real person, like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=48.0s	48.0	 I would also consider adding a daily probiotic for the time being to provide a beneficial gut bacteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=52.8s	52.8	 that can support her GI tract in case she did eat a bit of it instead of just licking it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=57.2s	57.2	 Did she recommend one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=58.1s	58.1	 Yeah, right here. Look.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=59.0s	59.0	 I mean, that's the thing. They know exactly what products to recommend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=62.2s	62.2	 I would have had to wonder what kind of supplements do I use or is there anything I can give her to be preventative here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=66.9s	66.9	 Most questions that we're going to have, we can get a quality answer for if we're talking to the right person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=71.4s	71.4	 without actually having to physically go into a vet's office.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=74.3s	74.3	 Fuzzy is going to give our audience a special code so you can try it out for an entire week free of charge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=79.5s	79.5	 And you're also going to get $20 off any of the vet recommended products they have as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=83.2s	83.2	 Just go to yourfuzzy.com slash Zach,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=86.4s	86.4	 sign up and ask them all of the questions that you can think of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=89.8s	89.8	 I'm going to have a link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=91.4s	91.4	 You're going to be okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=92.7s	92.7	 Now that inertia is under control, we can go train Biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=96.2s	96.2	 Our training is starting to get super interesting with Biscuits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 Today, we are at a brand new park.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=102.2s	102.2	 My goal today is to work on the life-saving skills of stay and come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=106.4s	106.4	 And maybe I'll get a little ambitious with heel, something so advanced that I rarely teach it to a puppy this young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=112.6s	112.6	 Biscuits continues to initially be nervous in new places.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=115.8s	115.8	 This is one of the reasons socialization to the world is extra valuable to puppies.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=120.5s	120.5	 I think she's a little unsure right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=122.8s	122.8	 That's usually what it means I feel like when she sits on my lap in this situation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=127.4s	127.4	 Or she's trying to steal my treats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 That might actually be it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=130.4s	130.4	 With Biscuits, I've been teaching her that sit means sit until I release you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=134.6s	134.6	 which is a great way to introduce the concept of stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=137.4s	137.4	 The way she holds her sit until I release her is looking so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=141.3s	141.3	 This could potentially help with redundancy for requests like stay when I've asked for a sit or a down, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=147.8s	147.8	 OK, and this is kind of how I've been teaching her the concept of stay for a period of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 whether it's sit for a few seconds and...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=156.0s	156.0	 OK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=156.7s	156.7	 And she's even doing pretty well with stay and stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=159.2s	159.2	 Good girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=161.0s	161.0	 OK, good girl. Very good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=163.2s	163.2	 By being extra animated when I release her, I'm likely being more clear to her for these beginning sessions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=168.8s	168.8	 What can I say? Puppies like excited people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=171.4s	171.4	 But that's the easiest version of stay. That is, stay for a period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=177.3s	177.3	 OK, I've noticed when a lot of new people to training, when they teach stay, they're tempted to walk away instantly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=184.0s	184.0	 And your instinct isn't that bad because obviously you want to make sure your dog stays while you walk away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=188.8s	188.8	 In my experience, if you really just focus on rewarding stay for just a few seconds at a time and work your way up to a longer duration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=195.6s	195.6	 and then start adding distance, you're more likely to succeed in teaching a more reliable stay in a variety of contexts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=202.2s	202.2	 I mean, that was a really nice moment. I love that she's looking at the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=206.2s	206.2	 I also love that she's looking back to me right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=209.0s	209.0	 In other words, she's not barking. She's not pulling towards the dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=211.7s	211.7	 I don't want to wait for her to start picking up that behavior before I address it, ideally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=216.0s	216.0	 So I really want to reinforce that. And they're just hanging out right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=218.8s	218.8	 And she's just observing calmly. This is what I like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=221.3s	221.3	 I'm still getting her focus while there's dogs in the area.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=224.7s	224.7	 She's in a brand new park. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=227.7s	227.7	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=229.8s	229.8	 All right. I'm ready to take stay to the next level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=232.2s	232.2	 Now I'm hoping to add distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=235.1s	235.1	 Good. Good means you're on the right track, but I don't have to reward you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=240.4s	240.4	 Yes. Yes means you definitely earned a reward, though here I'll wait or gently encourage her to resume her sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=250.3s	250.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=251.3s	251.3	 And I'll release her here. Take note of how far away I walk to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=254.8s	254.8	 Okay. When teaching stay with distance, keep those first few attempts nice and close.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=260.4s	260.4	 I'm taking one step away. I'm not asking her to sit and stay for a long period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=265.4s	265.4	 And I'm making sure that she knows when the stay is over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=268.2s	268.2	 And I'm doing my best to not let her fail, even if that means releasing her very quickly from that stay in the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=275.6s	275.6	 Since there are tons of organic distractions, Biscuit's been trying to get her to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=280.9s	280.9	 Biscuit's is likely to become distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=282.9s	282.9	 I'm hoping to teach her how to listen to me when becoming distracted, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=288.1s	288.1	 Okay. Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=290.2s	290.2	 That was good, though. She held until I said okay, even though she was watching some pedestrian traffic over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=295.8s	295.8	 Here. Biscuit's. Yes. Love that recall. It's looking very good. Sit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=303.3s	303.3	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=306.1s	306.1	 Here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=307.6s	307.6	 Okay. Yes. Just keeping these stays very brief and with minimal distance right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=314.1s	314.1	 Walking away. She's really engaged right now. And this? This is where I really want her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=320.7s	320.7	 Okay. Yes. How about that? But I have a feeling this may not be what I get all of the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 It would be nice, though, wouldn't it? She's becoming distracted by something on the tree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=330.2s	330.2	 I'm going to avoid pulling her in exchange for her coming to me completely voluntarily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=335.1s	335.1	 Biscuit's. Yes. Ah, love it. Rath isn't telling her no. I'm encouraging her to do something more productive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=342.1s	342.1	 So I'm trying to just leapfrog that with her right now. I've really been relying on keeping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=346.7s	346.7	 her recall training upbeat. If you're trying to get your dog to come to you more reliably,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=351.1s	351.1	 even if once they did and now they don't, never be afraid to take a step back to reteach it a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=356.6s	356.6	 bit and follow up the behavior of coming to you when you call them with an amazing outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=361.8s	361.8	 Whatever that means for your dog, whether it's playing with a toy, getting to run a couple of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=365.5s	365.5	 laps around a field or a really good piece of food, it's always so rewarding when you can get them to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=370.4s	370.4	 do it voluntarily because that's ultimately what we're after. Ideally, having a trained dog at some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=375.1s	375.1	 point means we don't necessarily have to rely all the time on something external like a leash or some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=380.7s	380.7	 type of special collar. And here I can also use the environment as the reward. So within reason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=385.8s	385.8	 I'm going to let her explore. Then I think I'm ready to get into some leash training with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=389.9s	389.9	 She will get no special treatment from me because of her size. Even if she were 110 pound German
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=395.5s	395.5	 Shepherd, I will train her the same way here. Yes. So when she sees a distraction, see how I let her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=403.4s	403.4	 take it in. She, especially when she behaves like that, let her take it in, then ask her to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=407.9s	407.9	 something, then let her go back to doing what she was doing. I'm really trying to balance these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=412.2s	412.2	 obedience training sessions with the basics with also allowing her to get some social experience in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=417.5s	417.5	 new places. Every new thing she smells is going to give her new information about the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=423.1s	423.1	 Teaching heel or stay at my side while we walk isn't the easiest task for a young puppy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=427.6s	427.6	 but biscuits has demonstrated she's not just any puppy. You know, that's a leaf in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=434.2s	434.2	 Things are not going to be easy for us given that it is fall and there are interesting leaves all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=438.7s	438.7	 over the ground today. Although biscuits is starting to lose all interest in training as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=443.2s	443.2	 the environment throws one thing after another at us. Let's see if we can work through this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=447.9s	447.9	 Biscuits, come on. This is about as non-compliant as she's been so far. She really wants to get to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=452.3s	452.3	 those leaves. Biscuits. Yes. Okay, good. I've got her attention now. We're a little bit closer to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=457.6s	457.6	 the trail over here and that point is not lost on her. Trust me, we are going to do some leash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=463.3s	463.3	 training, but I want you to have an accurate picture of how I approach training when a dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=467.3s	467.3	 is becoming distracted. Biscuits. Yes. Our first heel training was in our living room last
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=473.5s	473.5	 episode out here will prove to be a lot tougher though. I'm going to pick up where I left off
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=477.9s	477.9	 indoors with leash training, but I'm going to see if I can get her to do it out here, which is a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=481.5s	481.5	 harder. I mean, look at all this debris everywhere, you know, and she also has a leash on her out here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=485.9s	485.9	 Here. Look at me. Yes. Okay. Good girl. I like that she just took a few steps to me, came up to my
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=494.6s	494.6	 side, stopped, accepted her reward. So I wanted to deliberately release her from that, let her go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=499.8s	499.8	 to where she was, and I'm going to keep on telling, even though it was just a five second thing she did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=502.6s	502.6	 I'm trying to establish this rhythm with her that she can feel free to explore as well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=506.8s	506.8	 particularly right now at her very young age. Here. Good. And then look at that turn. Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=514.1s	514.1	 Here. Yes. Just giving her a treat for one half step of compliance while paying attention to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=521.5s	521.5	 That's what I'm trying to teach her to do. Okay. And I want to release her from that heel position
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=525.8s	525.8	 to let her know when it's over. I'm going to take a step back here to guiding her with my finger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=531.1s	531.1	 I've got a little bit of treat in my hand too. So I'm trying to phase in the signal out here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=536.9s	536.9	 the hand signal, and make her less reliant on looking at the treat. She did really well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=541.5s	541.5	 last night indoors, but out here, much harder to focus for her. Okay. It's becoming really clear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=546.2s	546.2	 to me that I can't just pick up where I left off yesterday inside the house. It's proving really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=550.9s	550.9	 challenging to keep her attention on me. One strategy I frequently use in a case like this is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=555.4s	555.4	 to take a step back and find easy things to acknowledge in the hopes that I can get her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=560.1s	560.1	 back online somehow. Now she's giving me her attention. I'm going to say, I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=564.7s	564.7	 Now come over here. I like that. Yes. I like it. Anytime she looks up at me, I'm going to reward now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=572.5s	572.5	 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Took a little bit more time there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=588.1s	588.1	 And since I'm using her meal today, I can afford to give her a lot of treats. Yes. Sometimes she
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=595.1s	595.1	 has a tendency to be jumpy just like that. I'm trying to preempt those jumps. Yes. And okay. Good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=604.3s	604.3	 girl. I'm going to give her a couple of treats there. I'm going to see if she can make her way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=610.3s	610.3	 back into this position, but again, letting her check things out here. Good. Yes. Yes. Every single
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=620.9s	620.9	 dog is different, but in biscuits case, I'm really noticing how she'll give me really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=626.3s	626.3	 focus for a few seconds at a time. And then she becomes a bit distracted here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=635.2s	635.2	 Yes. That was cool. She really responded to my hand signal there. That was nice. And I think it's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=641.8s	641.8	 really important to give her her biscuits time to check things out and investigate it. So I really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=647.7s	647.7	 only want her training with me if she's really in the mood to right now and guess whose job it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=652.6s	652.6	 to get her in the mood to want to train me. Hey, biscuits sleep here. Yes. Really nice job. Biscuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=662.8s	662.8	 is showing an interest to continue on with this training, but that isn't always the case with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=666.9s	666.9	 or other dogs I work with. When I am in a place like this and my dog just won't give me any attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=671.9s	671.9	 at all, rather than getting frustrated and resorting to physical corrections and cohesion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=676.5s	676.5	 and anger, it's best to just take a step back on your training, find a more easy environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=681.0s	681.0	 and just work up to it. Sometimes we underestimate how much an environment can throw our dogs off,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=685.5s	685.5	 myself included, because sometimes you have to test but just be okay with wherever your dog is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=691.0s	691.0	 and work at their pace. We really have to do that just like we have to work with kids at their pace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=695.2s	695.2	 in school. Biscuits! Yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=703.9s	703.9	 There's nothing that makes a dog trainer happier than getting a dog to run to them when there are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=708.3s	708.3	 dogs that close by. She's very smart, she's small, she's lovable, she's good with dogs, she's just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=715.1s	715.1	 a perfect pup- well okay she she does bite. Well looks like she's pretty tired and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=722.6s	722.6	 uh ready for a nice rest. She's been passed out up here. You comfy girl? I mean this is why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=730.6s	730.6	 we do training honestly. I mean if you have a dog who kind of drives you up the wall because
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=735.3s	735.3	 they're being crazy or because they're being very energetic, just getting out there working with them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=741.1s	741.1	 a few minutes a day, 20 minutes to an hour is probably a good number, satisfies them in such
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=746.7s	746.7	 a unique way. In a way that say for example playing with another dog in the household may not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpehfekIVmg&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=160&pp=iAQB&t=752.8s	752.8	 There's something about interacting with people that just seems to make dogs more content. You guys have
