https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=0.0s	0.0	 There's nothing more important in training than teaching your dog to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=3.0s	3.0	 Today I'm going to cover that as well as three vital dimensions to your training you must understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=7.6s	7.6	 to teach your dog almost everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=10.0s	10.0	 Click thumbs up for Bruno the puppy and click subscribe if you're new.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=13.4s	13.4	 If you want to learn everything I know about dog training, hey, it's free.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=16.6s	16.6	 And pick up a copy of my book, Dog Training Revolution.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=20.0s	20.0	 You can also download the audio version too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=22.5s	22.5	 Today Bruno and I are going to cover the critical 3 D's of dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=26.3s	26.3	 In fact, I'm willing to say if you understand these three concepts, and you will,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=30.6s	30.6	 you're going to be well on your way to having a perfectly behaved dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=33.9s	33.9	 Speaking of stay, did you know you can stay home, stay out of traffic, and stay with your dog
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=39.3s	39.3	 instead of rushing to the pet supply store just to get dog food?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=42.6s	42.6	 Why should any of us have to stop what we're doing to do a time-consuming unnecessary chore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=47.2s	47.2	 if we don't have to?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=48.7s	48.7	 Here's how it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=49.5s	49.5	 Just go to PetFlow, choose your puppy's favorite food, and how often you want it delivered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=54.3s	54.3	 I'll have a special link and a coupon code in the description that will give you 20%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=58.9s	58.9	 off of your first order.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 So let's discuss what we dog trainers refer to as the three D's in dog training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=66.4s	66.4	 The first one, having your dog focus on you for a period of time, duration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=71.1s	71.1	 Next, teaching your dog to listen to you a bit farther away, distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=75.4s	75.4	 And finally, teaching your dog, ouch, to listen to you in a more exciting situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=80.8s	80.8	 or around distractions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=82.6s	82.6	 That's the third D.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=84.2s	84.2	 Today, I'm going to try and illustrate all three of these concepts by showing you how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=88.2s	88.2	 to teach your dog to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=90.0s	90.0	 The three D's, duration, distance, and distraction, aren't just for teaching your dog stay, though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=94.7s	94.7	 They come in handy for a variety of different things, whether that's stay, come, play dead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=99.0s	99.0	 or speak.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=99.7s	99.7	 But stay is a potentially life-saving skill that you should work on early and often with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=104.2s	104.2	 your dog in their first year of training, regardless of age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=107.2s	107.2	 When teaching your dog anything, it's always a good idea to break things down into smaller
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=111.1s	111.1	 steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=111.8s	111.8	 Not only will your dog learn more quickly, but it's just easier that way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=115.4s	115.4	 Essentially, what this means is only requiring your dog's attention for very short bursts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=119.6s	119.6	 of time, at least at the beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=121.6s	121.6	 Let me show you what I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=123.0s	123.0	 Stay, one, two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=124.9s	124.9	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=126.3s	126.3	 Okay, get up, come on, over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=128.2s	128.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=129.2s	129.2	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=130.0s	130.0	 So that happened really fast, didn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=131.9s	131.9	 What we got was a two-second stay, and then I released Bruno from the stay to just be very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=136.8s	136.8	 clear about my communication that, hey, that stay is over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=139.8s	139.8	 It's almost as if you're trying to catch your dog staying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=142.7s	142.7	 You want to take advantage of those opportunities to let them know that you like what they're
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=146.6s	146.6	 doing at that moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=148.0s	148.0	 Sit, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=149.5s	149.5	 One, two, three.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=150.9s	150.9	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=152.2s	152.2	 You're doing terrific.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=153.6s	153.6	 At first, get really good at teaching your dog how to do a three to five-second stay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=157.1s	157.1	 and work up to a good 30-second stay over that first week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=160.7s	160.7	 Do everything you can to keep your dog from breaking stay more than one time in a row.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=164.6s	164.6	 This will keep you both focused on success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=167.3s	167.3	 If you're like most people, you probably have started working on stay while you walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=171.1s	171.1	 away or with distance a little bit prematurely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=174.4s	174.4	 Before you get too serious about distance training, make sure that your dog is really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=178.1s	178.1	 staying for a period of time pretty solidly first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=181.4s	181.4	 This is a key point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=182.6s	182.6	 Understand that the farther away you and your dog are, the less likely your dog is to listen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=187.6s	187.6	 to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 So distance training does require a pretty serious commitment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=191.2s	191.2	 Fortunately for us, though, teaching your dog to stay while at a distance is one of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=195.9s	195.9	 the easier things to teach with distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=198.6s	198.6	 As before, we're going to go in small steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=200.9s	200.9	 Let me show you what I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=202.0s	202.0	 Sit, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=204.5s	204.5	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=206.0s	206.0	 Okay, come on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=207.0s	207.0	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=207.9s	207.9	 Notice I just took one step back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=209.8s	209.8	 I didn't walk 10 feet back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=211.2s	211.2	 I didn't pause for 30 seconds and wait for Bruno over here to break his stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=215.7s	215.7	 I set him up for success.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=217.0s	217.0	 This is very, very important if you're interested in making progress in a reasonable amount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=222.2s	222.2	 of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=223.1s	223.1	 Sit, stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=226.7s	226.7	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=227.9s	227.9	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=229.1s	229.1	 Nice work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=229.9s	229.9	 Even though we got up a little bit there, I'm not too worried about that because I can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=233.0s	233.0	 tell that he's trying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=234.2s	234.2	 Adjust your expectations as to how you define distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=237.8s	237.8	 For example, with some young dogs, particularly puppies that are only a few weeks old, you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=243.0s	243.0	 might just need to back away a few inches like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=245.6s	245.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=246.8s	246.8	 Yes, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=247.9s	247.9	 Because young dogs are particularly clingy and really want to follow you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=252.3s	252.3	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=253.4s	253.4	 So Bruno's doing a great job here when I take a step or two back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=257.5s	257.5	 I'm just going to kind of experiment and see what I can get away with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=260.2s	260.2	 Look at me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=261.0s	261.0	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=262.3s	262.3	 I'm going to wait until I get his attention before asking him to stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=265.6s	265.6	 Hey, up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=266.7s	266.7	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=267.7s	267.7	 That's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=269.0s	269.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=270.2s	270.2	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=270.9s	270.9	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=271.6s	271.6	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=274.0s	274.0	 Yeah, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=274.9s	274.9	 Ah, ah, ah, ah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=277.0s	277.0	 And since he's got that habit of kind of popping up there, I think it's an easy enough matter

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=281.9s	281.9	 So I'll ask for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=283.4s	283.4	 Look at me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=292.2s	292.2	 I'm going back a little bit farther this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=295.8s	295.8	 Stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=297.5s	297.5	 And as you continue to do this, avoid being too predictable by just taking three steps

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=311.6s	311.6	 I'm going to change my angle a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=314.6s	314.6	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=320.4s	320.4	 I'm not going to pause at the end of my stay because I want to make sure that I set him

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=325.2s	325.2	 That was an amazing example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=326.7s	326.7	 He is just doing stellar right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=328.6s	328.6	 Okay, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=329.7s	329.7	 Regardless of what stage of stay you're teaching your dog, it's important to routinely keep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=334.7s	334.7	 those rewards coming to them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=338.0s	338.0	 That means don't just give them one treat for every stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=341.1s	341.1	 If they're really succeeding on a long stay while you walk away, it's okay to treat them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=344.7s	344.7	 three or four times during that stay if necessary before releasing them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=348.0s	348.0	 Bruno is doing even better than I expected him to be doing at this point in this training

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=356.8s	356.8	 training and teach him how to stay with distance and duration combined.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=373.0s	373.0	 Okay, yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=374.6s	374.6	 Oh, that was awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=375.6s	375.6	 I'm going to give him a really big reward there because that was his first 10 second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=379.6s	379.6	 stay with distance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=380.9s	380.9	 That's a big deal, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=382.1s	382.1	 That's awesome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=383.0s	383.0	 Bruno, we have a video to shoot here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=384.8s	384.8	 You can't chew on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=386.2s	386.2	 Needless to say, you'll need to teach your dog how to stay in the presence of a minor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=390.4s	390.4	 distraction before expecting them to stay in the presence of a major distraction like

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=395.4s	395.4	 Now, we know Bruno will stay for a few seconds at a time here, so we're going to get him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=398.8s	398.8	 warmed up with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=399.9s	399.9	 And now I'm just going to move this toy a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=402.3s	402.3	 Yes, good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=403.6s	403.6	 I'm going to reward him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=404.4s	404.4	 He didn't respond to this moving distraction, but now I'm going to up the ante a little
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=408.0s	408.0	 bit and make it a bit tougher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=409.5s	409.5	 Stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=412.8s	412.8	 That was his first broken stay of the day right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=416.0s	416.0	 That's because we've been going out of our way to set him up to be successful each time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=420.5s	420.5	 Yes, good boy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=425.3s	425.3	 I'm not even giving him a chance to break.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=427.6s	427.6	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=428.2s	428.2	 Bruno, stay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=431.6s	431.6	 I'm not getting up and walking away and pausing for many seconds at a time and also distracting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=436.7s	436.7	 him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=437.0s	437.0	 I'm staying up close because that's easier for him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=439.7s	439.7	 So teach each one of these independently before combining them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=443.6s	443.6	 But I'm feeling pretty good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=444.8s	444.8	 I'd like to see if we can get lucky and get a glimmer of success with combining duration,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=458.2s	458.2	 Are you kidding me?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=461.5s	461.5	 That is unbelievable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=462.8s	462.8	 I'm going to go ahead and give yet another big jackpot reward to Bruno for that exceptional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=467.8s	467.8	 behavior there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=468.8s	468.8	 I mean, this is really not as easy as it looks with many dogs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=471.6s	471.6	 Don't be discouraged if you don't progress this quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=474.2s	474.2	 But it's all about timing and really finding those tiny moments of success if you really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=478.5s	478.5	 want to make a lot of gains in a shorter period of time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=481.3s	481.3	 That's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=482.3s	482.3	 That's fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=482.9s	482.9	 I don't mind that he lied down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=484.3s	484.3	 Again, he's not moving away from me and he's not coming towards me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=487.3s	487.3	 He's maintaining his general position in space here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=491.1s	491.1	 Stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=494.9s	494.9	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=495.6s	495.6	 Good job.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=496.1s	496.1	 And I made it even tougher there by dropping the toy and he still maintained his stay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=501.1s	501.1	 When he gives you those eyes, you reward that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=503.3s	503.3	 If you don't have your dog's eyes, you do not have your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=505.8s	505.8	 You must be able to get their eyes on cue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=508.0s	508.0	 It's important to maintain this line of sight here where you can really have good eye contact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=511.9s	511.9	 just to kind of stay in communication with your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=514.8s	514.8	 Plus, it's easier to read if they're going to break or if they're thinking about breaking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=519.8s	519.8	 Okay.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=520.8s	520.8	 If you look into their eyes and you suspect that they're thinking about breaking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=524.4s	524.4	 that's your cue to get in there and end the stay before they fail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=530.3s	530.3	 Up here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAziMECDxD0&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=498&pp=iAQB&t=531.0s	531.0	 Yes.
