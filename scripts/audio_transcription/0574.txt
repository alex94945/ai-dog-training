https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=311.8s	311.8	 That's not always easy to do.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=315.6s	315.6	 A, create distance and B, get them focused on you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=325.9s	325.9	 So right now there's a dog, another German Shepherd dog actually behind us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=328.9s	328.9	 So we're going to create distance over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=331.0s	331.0	 It's important to feel that out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=333.5s	333.5	 You know, sometimes you may only need to go a few feet away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=335.9s	335.9	 Other times you may need to go out of sight if they're really, really overstimulated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=339.2s	339.2	 Okay, now it's time to get back to business and focus on the fundamentals while there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=342.7s	342.7	 are only moderate distractions around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=344.9s	344.9	 Our goal is to get from here to the end of the pathway without doing some pulling too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=349.2s	349.2	 much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=350.2s	350.2	 I mean, I'm going to pick my battles here, but the goal is to really emphasize when there's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=353.6s	353.6	 no tension on the leash.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=355.5s	355.5	 And remember, the key is getting his attention on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=358.2s	358.2	 So I'm going to try and get him into tug mode again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=362.0s	362.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=364.0s	364.0	 Good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=365.0s	365.0	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=366.0s	366.0	 Good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=371.6s	371.6	 Before the pulling occurs, I'm changing direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=374.0s	374.0	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=375.0s	375.0	 Good boy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=376.0s	376.0	 I want him to not know where the walk is headed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=377.7s	377.7	 When we become predictable, that's going to set us back on initial leash walking training.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=381.9s	381.9	 That'd be one step ahead of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=384.1s	384.1	 Right there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=385.1s	385.1	 I see that he's going to start pulling in a moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=386.8s	386.8	 Oh, actually, that was quite good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=388.3s	388.3	 Nope.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=389.3s	389.3	 Right there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=393.6s	393.6	 that's too fast for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=394.8s	394.8	 Come on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=399.5s	399.5	 Otherwise, if you have trouble getting low, either use a treat or a toy and try and, you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=414.7s	414.7	 You have to be engaging, too, and you've got to be really interesting to your dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P53AlqxWf4&list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&index=575&pp=iAQB&t=418.1s	418.1	 Look at this.
